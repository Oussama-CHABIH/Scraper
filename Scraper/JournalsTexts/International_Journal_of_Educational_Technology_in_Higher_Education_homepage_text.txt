Journal history
The
International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education (ETHE)
is the new name of
RUSC. Universities and Knowledge Society Journal
. This is the start of a new era for the open-access online scientific journal founded in 2004 by the
Open University of Catalonia (UOC)
. The journal has published 12 volumes containing more than 250 articles, 177 of which have appeared in both English and Spanish.
Between 2013 and 2015 the journal was co-edited by UOC and the University of New England (Australia). From 2016 a new stage starts, with the Universidad de los Andes as co-editor of the journal with the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. From volume 13 onwards, the journal is published by Springer, which will undoubtedly expand the reach and impact of the articles.
It will continue to be an open-access online journal under the academic management of UOC, with assistance from an International Editorial Board comprised of experts in Educational Technology in Higher Education.

Network analysis of gratitude messages in the learning community
In pedagogical practice, gratitude is recognised not as an emotion, but as an approach to learning. This study introduced gratitude messages into the academic online communication of university students and specifically examined the community in which students shared their messages with gratitude. This study examined the tendency of message connections and how gratitude messages prompted replies. To elucidate their connections, exponential random graph models (ERGMs) were used. A post-event questionnaire to evaluate gratitude experiences was also administered. Results revealed that 77.3% of the 172 connected messages from 123 students involved gratitude. When the post-event questionnaire results were examined using an ERGM, the score effects on increasing message connections were found not to be significant. The most prominent indication was a higher level of significant propensities to make mutual connections. The homophily of the message content was found to have a significant propensity to increase connections. The ERGM results and a review of messages revealed that students expressed gratitude for being both benefactors and beneficiaries of gratitude messages, which confirmed their prosocial behaviour.

Learning from success stories when using eLearning and bLearning modalities in higher education: a meta-analysis and lessons towards digital educational transformation
This work seeks to support scholars interested in non-face-to-face modalities of higher education in making decisions about the use of digital and educational technologies (DET) to promote educational transformation (ET) in the context of their organizations. This organizational change deals with the implementation of technology-based flexible educational practices, focused on helping students develop competencies of interest for their personal and professional growth. With this in mind, in 2018 we identified and followed six leading higher education institutions on three continents that, for years, have carried out educational innovation experiences with the support of technology. Two of the analyzed experiences make use of eLearning, another of bLearning, and the others combine eLearning and bLearning as a complement to the face-to-face modality. The meta-analysis of the cases, carried out in 2019, followed suggestions from (Stake in The art of case study research, Sage Publications Inc., 1995) as well as from qualitative research that seeks to understand what is behind the cases from three dimensions: education, technology, organization. For each one, we determined what they do, how they do it, and what success factors must be considered. As the data was collected before the 2020 pandemic and this issue produced structural imbalances in society and in higher education, it was considered pertinent, at the end of 2020, to check the pulse of the ET mediated with DET in three of the six institutions studied. The purpose was to refine the findings of the meta-analysis and learn from the decisions made in the situation of forced change in environments, means, and strategies to continue providing quality higher education.

Digital higher education: a divider or bridge builder? Leadership perspectives on edtech in a COVID-19 reality
The edtech community has promoted claims that digital education enhances access, learning, and collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic tested these claims like never before, as higher education systems seemingly overnight had to move teaching online. Through a sequential mixed-method approach, we investigated how 85 higher education leaders in 24 countries experienced this rapid digital transformation. Through their experiences, we identified the multiple and overlapping factors that contribute to an institution’s ability to realize the potential of digital education, in terms of access, learning and collaboration, whilst highlighting deeply rooted inequalities at the individual, institutional and system level. Drawing on these empirics, we put forth recommendations for closing the digital divides and pathways forward. Higher education leaders are uniquely positioned to move beyond the emergency adoption of online learning towards inclusive, long-term visions for digital education, which emphasize collaboration over individual gain.

Featured article: Understanding the faculty perspectives influencing their innovative practices in MOOCs/SPOCs: a case study
Using a pedagogical discourse-based approach, this paper analyzes the backgrounds of faculty at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid who participate in MOOCs, Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) or other projects, and interprets the factors that influence their understanding of the practices in these environments. The research demonstrates that faculty with traditional beliefs are compelled to transform their practices using this kind of course design. However, their interests are more focused on the social value of learning by promoting their research areas in an entertaining way, than on the pedagogical value of online education through innovating their practices.

Featured article: Analysis of the use of social media in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) using the Technology Acceptance Model
This paper analyzes the drivers of social media in higher education institutions (HEIs) in an emerging economy by adopting aspects of the Technology Acceptance Model including subjective norm, perceived playfulness, Internet reliability and speed as additional constructs. The findings, though preliminary, suggest that private HEIs should initiate or continue the use of social media in classrooms, because intention to use translate to actual use of these tools. Public institutions, however, should improve Internet reliability and speed and should reassess their use of social media in order to fully take advantage of the benefits of ICT.

Investigating relationships between community of inquiry perceptions and attitudes towards reading circles in Chinese blended EFL learning
Little research has been conducted to investigate relationships between students’ community of inquiry (CoI) perceptions and their attitudes towards reading circles (ARC). To bridge the gap this quantitative research reports a cohort of Chinese students’ perceptions of CoI and its prediction for their attitudes towards reading circles (RC) in English as a Foreign Language learning. The researchers administered and collected 202 valid questionnaires. They analyzed the correlations between CoI and ARC dimensions, did regression analyses and came up with insightful findings. It’s found that, concerning CoI, students have more positive perceptions of teaching and cognitive presences than of social presence. Meanwhile teaching presence, cognitive presence, social presence of CoI and usefulness, affect, and behavior of ARC are closely correlated. CoI teaching presence and cognitive presence are significant predictors for usefulness and behavior of ARC, while the combination of the three CoI presences predicts affect of ARC. Investigating the relationships between a longstanding CoI framework and a fledging ARC scale provides great implications for Chinese blended EFL teaching, especially in reading courses.

Social anxiety in digital learning environments: an international perspective and call to action
The research focused on digital learning environments has identified various challenges for learners, such as technical problems, lack of community, motivation, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and social anxiety. Social anxiety is conceptualized as an emotional disorder that may impede achievement in higher education. The project reported here investigates N = 666 students' social anxiety in digital learning environments at four higher education institutions located in Australia, Germany, Latvia, and Turkey. This range of contexts allowed the research to cover a wide variety of cultural and institutional idiosyncrasies. Findings revealed different levels of social anxiety in higher education digital learning environments across countries and their cultural contexts. In addition, gender plays a significant role in social anxiety for peer interactions with female students reporting higher social anxiety than male students. The findings suggest that it is worth tertiary educators pausing to consider social anxiety's role in reducing interactions within digital learning environments. Additional research is required to establish the causes of social anxiety in digital learning environments and, as a result, to develop strategies to minimise its effect.

Going online? Does transferring to online university increase the likelihood of graduation among students from lower social background?
The increase in university participation has led to greater complexity in terms of students' trajectories, with the option of changing degree course or higher education institution or, more recently, the mode of study (face-to-face and online learning). These transitions can be strategic moves that facilitate greater continuity in educational trajectories and increase equity within the education system. Online universities offer greater flexibility in terms of time and location, providing new opportunities for students with specific profiles to pursue higher education. This article aims to delve into the complex trajectories of change and to analyse whether there are differences in educational outcomes based on students' social backgrounds. Using registry data from the Catalan university system (n = 42,370), we identify and characterise the trajectories of change and analyse the effect of the interaction between them and social origin on educational outcomes. The results indicate that students from lower social backgrounds and those who also work are most likely to transition to virtual education. However, social background continues to have an effect on the probability of graduating, dropping out or pursuing further studies.

Digital literacies, social media, and undergraduate learning: what do students think they need to know?
This research addresses an identified need to further understand digital literacies (DL) and whether undergraduate students view DL as being important in their lives and in their learning. Using a cross-sectional survey sent to a stratified random sample of 2500 undergraduates representative of the overall student population at a medium-sized Canadian undergraduate university (survey response rate of 19.8%, N = 496), we explored the relationships between social media and digital literacies, particularly in different disciplinary contexts. We also explored the ways in which students report using social media in their university learning, showing that students value social media for collaboration, discussion, information finding and sharing, and practise activities related to their learning. Additionally, we examined the importance students place on DL, and how they perceive and rate their own abilities with digital literacies across three domains: procedural and technical, cognitive, and sociocultural. Findings illustrate an observable gap between the high importance that students place on digital literacies (including DL for social media) in their learning and their lives and the lack of coverage students reported receiving about these topics in their undergraduate education. Based on the study’s findings, we discuss the specific ways that those in the higher education community can address this gap by engaging with and fostering development of digital literacies within specific disciplinary and professional contexts, and in interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary learning settings across the curriculum.

Assessing digital competence and its relationship with the socioeconomic level of Chilean university students
Digital competence (DC) is one of the key aspects in citizen development in the digital age. The DC is particularly important in forming university students and future teachers. This article presents the main results of a study to evaluate DC and its relationship with the socioeconomic level of first-year students of pedagogy in three Chilean public universities, located in the north, center, and south of the country. A quantitative research methodology was used, with a sample of 817 students, the data were collected through the DIGCOMP-PED evaluation instrument, which evaluates DC development using the DIGCOMP framework. The results were analyzed at the general and socioeconomic level on the variables of the educational establishment where they attended high school and the territorial area of the university they attended. The main results indicate that the level of DC achievement is intermediate, the areas with the highest levels of achievement were “network security” and “online communication and collaboration.” On the other hand, the lowest levels of achievement were reached in the areas “information and digital literacy,” “digital content creation,” and “problem solving.” The level of DC is higher among students of private establishments and those who attend universities located in the central area.

The university students’ self-regulated effort, flexibility and satisfaction in distance education
Distance education offers flexible learning opportunities in terms of time, place and learning speed to teachers and students through internet technologies. However, the learning opportunities provided in distance education environments require students to act more autonomously and take more responsibility for regulating their learning processes to achieve their learning goals. For this reason, it is crucial to reveal the relationships between flexibility, self-regulated effort and satisfaction factors to provide efficient and effective learning environments in distance education. Accordingly, within the scope of this study, it is aimed to investigate university students’ perceptions of flexibility, self-regulated effort and satisfaction with the distance education process, and their views on distance education. Survey research was used as the research method in the study. The study sample consisted of 1760 university students studying at 28 different universities. Data were analysed using t-test, ANOVA, and regression methods. As a result of the study, male students were more satisfied with distance education than female students, and education faculty students had the highest level of satisfaction. In addition, self-regulated effort and flexibility variables were significant factors affecting students’ satisfaction towards distance education. Furthermore, the advantages and problems of distance education and suggestions for future distance learning environments were presented in the light of students views. Finally, the study’s implications and various recommendations for practitioners and researchers were discussed in detail.

Flipped classroom (FC) approaches have gotten substantial attention in the last decade because they have a potential to stimulate student engagement as well as active and collaborative learning. The FC is generally defined as a strategy that flips the traditional education setting, i.e., the information transmission component of a traditional face-to-face lecture is moved out of class time. The FC relies on technology and is therefore suitable for online or blended learning, which were predominant forms of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–July 2021). In this paper we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies that covered online FC approaches in higher education during the pandemic. We analyzed 205 publications in total and 18 in detail. Our research questions were related to the main findings about the success of implementation of online FC and recommendations for future research. The findings indicated that those who had used FC approaches in face-to-face or blended learning environments more successfully continued to use them in online environments than those who had not used it before. The SLR opened possible questions for future research, such as the effectiveness of the FC for different courses and contexts, the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement, and students’ data protection. It pointed to the need to examine different aspects of online delivery of the FC more comprehensively, and with more research rigor.

Increasingly, among international organizations concerned with unemployment rates and industry demands, there is an emphasis on the need to improve graduates’ employability skills and the transparency of mechanisms for their recognition. This research presents the Employability Skills Micro-credentialing (ESMC) methodology, designed under the EPICA Horizon 2020 (H2020) project and tested at three East African universities, and shows how it fosters pedagogical innovation and promotes employability skills integration and visibility. The methodology, supported by a competency-based ePortfolio and a digital micro-credentialing system, was evaluated using a mixed-method design, combining descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis to capture complementary stakeholder perspectives. The study involved the participation of 13 lecturers, 169 students, and 24 employers. The results indicate that the ESMC methodology is a promising approach for supporting students in their transition from academia to the workplace. The implementation of the methodology and the involvement of employers entails rethinking educational practices and academic curricula to embed employability skills. It enables all actors to broaden their understanding of the relationship between higher education and the business sector and to sustain visibility, transparency, and reliability of the recognition process. These findings indicate that there are favourable conditions in the region for the adoption of the approach, which is a meaningful solution for the stakeholder community to address the skills gap.

The use of system dynamics as a learning tool for developing sustainable energy strategies and environmental education has advanced in recent years with the availability of new modelling software and webtools. Among the existing models, we highlight the online 2050 Calculators, which aim at simulating scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions, energy planning, sustainable land use, and food consumption. The objective of this study is to assess the available calculators and their contribution to an interdisciplinary education via systems thinking. We carried out a review of the existing models worldwide and ran some of the tools with students from three different postgraduate programmes at master’s level at Imperial College London (United Kingdom) and IFP School (France), whilst also assessing their individual views afterwards. The assessments were conducted once a year during three subsequent years: 2019, 2020, and 2021. The results are discussed under the epistemology of critical pedagogy, showing that the use of webtools, such as the 2050 Calculators, can significantly contribute to the students’ environmental awareness and political engagement, providing important lessons about the use of system dynamics for policy and science education.

The rise of online modes of content delivery, termed e-learning, has increased student convenience and provided geographically remote students with more options for tertiary education. However, its efficacy relies upon student access to suitable technology and the internet, and the quality of the online course material. With the COVID-19 outbreak, education providers worldwide were forced to turn to e-learning to retain their student base and allow them to continue learning through the pandemic. However, in geographically remote, developing nations, many students may not have access to suitable technology or internet connections. Hence it is important to understand the potential of e-learning to maintain equitable access to education in such situations. This study found the majority (88%) of commencing students at the University of the South Pacific owned at least one ICT device and had access to the internet. Similarly, most students had adequate to strong ICT skills and a positive attitude toward e-learning. These attitudes among the student cohort, in conjunction with the previous experience of The University of the South Pacific in distance education, are likely to have contributed to its relatively successful transition from face-to-face to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This qualitative study examined how teachers fostered student engagement in blended learning (BL), i.e., blended, blended online, and blended synchronous courses that combine synchronous and asynchronous activities. Twenty semi-structured interviews with teachers in various disciplines, at the undergraduate or graduate level in four universities, were conducted and analyzed using an inductive approach. Therefore, the study proposed a broad and comprehensive picture of teachers’ strategies to enhance student engagement in BL, that were classified in three meta-categories concerning (i) the course structure and pace; (ii) the selection of teaching and learning activities; and (iii) the teacher’s role and course relationships. Strategies were also linked with student engagement dimensions (behavioral, emotional, cognitive), whenever possible. The findings particularly emphasized the importance of a well-structured and -paced course, fully exploiting and integrating synchronous and asynchronous modes of BL. Clearly communicating how the course would unfold and corresponding expectations as well as establishing trusting relationships at the beginning of the semester also appeared as key to foster student engagement in BL. The use of various digital tools was also highlighted to promote student behavioral and emotional engagement at the undergraduate level, whereas cognitive and emotional engagement of graduate students was mainly targeted through experience-sharing and learning co-construction between students.

In higher education, one commonly used teaching approach that is intended to develop deep learning is that of the ‘Oxford’ tutorial—a personalized Socratic approach in which an instructor discusses course-related issues with a handful of students. Even though this conventional tutorial model is well supported in the literature, it may be neglected by research-driven academics and is expensive to operate. The latter issue has placed tutorials in the spotlight because higher education institutions are facing huge funding cuts worldwide. In light of these problems, a scoping review was conducted to explore financially viable alternatives to the Oxford tutorial for management education. Articles in highly ranked management education and development academic journals were collected by searching these catalogs and compiling a database of 48 articles published in four premier journals. These articles were reviewed by two independent raters in order to arrive at 8 alternatives to the Oxford tutorial model that can achieve similar objectives of said tutorials while reducing costs. These alternative tutorial models all involve the application of information communication technologies to tutorials and include peer instruction, simulations and games, online collaborative learning, syndicates, flipped classrooms, communication systems, tailored learning, and portfolios. Challenges and implementation guidelines are explained for each alternative tutorial model.

Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in instruction; however, these foundations have not kept pace with technology's evolution. Through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences. Finally, the authors offer an approach for the assessment of these assignments, including a rubric.

With the development of information technology and the advent of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and Small Private Online Course (SPOC), various online courses which include a lot of new resources and new teaching methods have appeared. The application of advanced teaching resources and educational concepts can improve students' learning experiences. This paper proposes a hybrid closed-loop teaching model of analog circuit SPOC based on online live. The course design is centered on the improvement of students' abilities. An online course resources construction mode of self-built platform with excellent courses introduction is expounded. It enriches the number of online course resources and increases the forms of resource expression. In teaching design, here present the target classification method based on Bloom, the indicators of the Bloom model corresponding to the knowledge, process arrangement, and tests of analog circuits. It also discusses the rules and presentation methods of learning goals, and online experiment teaching based on simulation.

The emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) broadened the educational landscape by providing free access to quality learning materials for anyone with a device connected to the Internet. However, open access does not guarantee equals opportunities to learn, and research has repetitively reported that learners from affluent countries benefit the most from MOOCs. In this work, we delve into this gap by defining and measuring completion and assessment biases with respect to learners’ language and development status. We do so by performing a large-scale analysis across 158 MITx MOOC runs from 120 different courses offered on edX between 2013 and 2018, with 2.8 million enrollments. We see that learners from developing countries are less likely to complete MOOCs successfully, but we do not find evidence regarding a negative effect of not being English-native. Our findings point out that not only the specific population of learners is responsible for this bias, but also that the course itself has a similar impact. Independent of and less frequent than completion bias, we found assessment bias, that is when the mean ability gained by learners from developing countries is lower than that of learners from developed countries. The ability is inferred from the responses of the learners to the course-assessment using item response theory (IRT). Finally, we applied differential item functioning (DIF) methods with the objective of detecting items that might be causing the assessment bias, obtaining weak, yet positive results with respect to the magnitude of the bias reduction. Our results provide statistical evidence on the role that course design might have on these biases, with a call for action so that the future generation of MOOCs focus on strengthening their inclusive design approaches.

With the rampant pandemic of COVID-19, an increasing number of people are acquiring knowledge through online learning approaches. This study aims to investigate how to improve online learning effectiveness during this special time. Through a mixed design, this study revealed the effect of educational levels, gender, and personality traits on online learning outcomes. It was concluded that postgraduates (N = 599) outperformed undergraduates (N = 553) in online learning, learners (N = 1152) with strong personality traits such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to a new experience outperformed those with strong extraversion and neuroticism. Future research could improve interpersonal interactions and encourage learners to post words in the online discussion forum, focus on how to design scaffolding online learning and how to improve the quality and dynamic of the online contents, and highlight blended learning rather than either merely online or traditional face-to-face learning.

Educational technology has become an indispensable aspect of higher education, playing a crucial role in affecting student engagement, in particular. The application, advantages and disadvantages of learning management systems (LMS) and social networking systems in Chinese EFL courses, represented by Superstar—Xuexitong and WeChat, are introduced. The study aims to explore the relationship between the two educational technology tools and three dimensions of student engagement. Using an adopted and revised questionnaire from previous researches, the study measures the extent of impact of the specified educational technology tools on student engagement with the help of SPSS. Through the independent sample T tests, analysis of variance, correlation and regression, the study found that emotional engagement has the strongest positive effect on educational technology engagement. In addition, analysis of the four principal factors indicates that using LMS could engage students more than adopting social networking systems. There are significant differences in cognitive engagement between different genders, with that of males surpassing females. This article provides some empirical evidence for exploration into the use of educational technology in a specific discipline to foster better student engagement.

In a context where learning mediated by technology has gained prominence in higher education, learning analytics has become a powerful tool to collect and analyse data with the aim of improving students’ learning. However, learning analytics is part of a young community and its developments deserve further exploration. Some critical stances claim that learning analytics tends to underplay the complexity of teaching-learning processes. By means of both a bibliometric and a content analysis, this paper examines the publication patterns on learning analytics in higher education and their main challenges. 385 papers that were published in WoScc and SciELO indexes between 2013 and 2019 were identified and analysed. Learning analytics is a vibrant and fast-developing community. However, it continues to face multiple and complex challenges, especially regarding students’ learning and their implications. The paper concludes by distinguishing between a practice-based and management-oriented community of learning analytics and an academic-oriented community. Within both communities, though, it seems that the focus is more on analytics than on learning.

While course videos are powerful teaching resources in online courses, students often have difficulty sustaining their attention while watching videos and comprehending the content. This study adopted teacher annotations on videos as an instructional support to engage students in watching course videos. Forty-two students in an undergraduate course at a university in Taiwan were randomly divided into a control group that watched a course video without teacher annotations, and an experimental group that watched a course video with teacher annotations. The collected data included a learning engagement survey, students’ video watching behaviors, and student interviews. The results showed that there were differences in student learning engagement between the control and experimental groups. The teacher annotations increased students’ behavioral and cognitive engagement in watching the video but did not increase their emotional engagement. In addition, this study identified how students learned when watching the course video with the teacher annotations through highlights of the video content, literal questions, reflective questions and inferential questions. The results concluded that teacher annotations and student learning engagement were positively correlated. The students acknowledged that their retention and comprehension of the video content increased with the support of the teacher annotations.

This study aims to explore how stakeholders’ data literacy contributes to student success in a holistic view. The salience model is used to identify core stakeholders. The goal-modeling language iStar is used to present how stakeholders contribute to student success. A competencies matrix of data literacy is used to discuss the specific data literacy competencies that stakeholders should focus on promoting student success. A survey is conducted to validate the goal-oriented analysis and the discussions on specific competencies of data literacy for stakeholders. The goal-oriented analysis presents the complexity of interactions and dependencies among stakeholders for student success. This study helps to raise stakeholders to be aware of the importance of their data literacy and the necessity of collaboration on exploiting vast available data for student success.

This paper explores the potential in supporting asynchronous online discussion activity through learning analytics. From the beginning, the authors acknowledged the limitations of technology to support the complexities of a pedagogical activity. Therefore, the methodology used was participatory design-based research (DBR) divided into two main stages. The first design phase dealt with the engagement of teachers and pedagogical experts in defining the data and metrics to be used to support the pedagogical concepts. The second consisted of an implementation phase including pilots with students and with crucial engagement of teachers in commenting their understanding over students’ learning processes and the feedback the teachers could offer to them. Overall, the students shown improvements in their performance as monitored through the learning analytics group in contrast with control groups.

A considerable amount of literature has recently appeared around the theme of learning networks and Connectivism. However, our understanding of how and why students navigate learning networks in the way they do is limited and the field lacks empirical studies investigating how students form connections. This paper presents a model showing how students form connections to different kinds of resources, along with the criteria they use to decide on which resource to choose. The findings were derived by conducting retrospective think-aloud sessions with nine participants after solving 10 tasks each. Mixed-methods approach was used in the data analysis. A goal of this research is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the navigation processes in learning networks and to provide guidance for online learning practitioners who seek to improve their practices.

ETHE Celebrates 20 Years of Publications
This year, 2024, the
International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher
Education
celebrates its 20th anniversary. It is time to congratulate the journal on its achievements and contributions in the field, but more importantly, it is time to look to the future.
The journal was launched in 2004 at the
Universitat Oberta de Catalunya
(UOC)
. Since its beginning, the journal has been published digitally, in open access and free of charge for authors. The journal's original title was "
Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento (RUSC)
", and it published articles in Spanish until 2010, when it started publishing in English as well. In 2016, the journal adopted its current name and opened a new stage, published by Springer. Throughout its 20-year history, the journal has preserved its original principles: an open access and digital journal, supported by the sponsoring organisations, and contributing to disseminating scientific knowledge in educational technology in Higher Education.
Over the last two decades, educational technology in Higher Education has experienced significant changes and advances. There has been a transition from e-learning to digital education, a move from LMS to digital learning environments, the emergence of diverse theories of digital learning, the emergence of MOOCs, OERs and Open Science, a worldwide pandemic that has changed the world of education, and a new and exciting present moment of the AI resurgence applied to education.
ETHE, the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, offers a place for academics and practitioners to share their research and experiences. It has contributed to disseminating educational theories, findings and outcomes, research proposals and experiences in the field of educational technology in Higher Education, not only with the high-quality articles published in the journal but also with our essential presence in social networks and the recent creation of a new space to disseminate the journal’s subjects more informally, the
ETHE Blog
And we want to celebrate it with actions we will carry out during this year.
As a journal, we are aware of what we have achieved and of the support received from authors, reviewers, editors, publishers and readers, to whom we are incredibly grateful for their continuing recognition. Now, we must look to the future. Once again, with the support of all of us who make this journal possible, we must analyse the significant educational challenges we currently face and formulate proposals, analyses, and research to help us continue improving educational technology in Higher Education. And also, due to our long experience and growth, we can significantly contribute to academic publishing.
Thanks to all of you for your continued support. Stay tuned for the proposals we will present this year to celebrate ETHE’s  20th anniversary!

ETHE High-Impact Award
Celebrating 20 Years of ETHE
As part of the 20
th
anniversary (2004-2024) of the
International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education
(ETHE), the journal wishes to recognise authors who have contributed significantly to the field of educational technology in higher education. The ETHE’s High Impact Paper Award seeks to recognise papers with significant academic impact that have been published in the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education in the last ten years. To select those papers, a review committee was formed consisting of three members from the journal’s International Advisory Board, the journal's editor-in-chief, and the managing editor.
The review committee selected the recipients by evaluating papers against both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The quantitative metrics included reviewing the top twenty five papers for each category of the most downloads, the most number of citations and the highest altimetric attention scores. After removing duplicates, each paper was given a score according to each category which were weighted and aggregated. The twelve papers with the highest scores were shortlisted for evaluating against the qualitative criteria. The qualitative metrics included assigning and aggregating scores against transcending disciplinary boundaries, addressing real-world challenges, contributing to societal advancement or policy-making, and enhancing technology in teaching and learning. After reviewing the combined quantitative and qualitative scores, the review committee unanimously agreed to recognise the top six papers as high-impact publications in ETHE.
The review committee wishes to inform the ETHE community that these top papers exhibit:
Citations exceeding 306
Altimetric scores surpassing 117. This places each paper within the top 5% attention rank, in the 99th percentile compared to papers of similar age across all journals, and the 80th percentile within ETHE.
Interdisciplinary and practical approaches that contribute to the body of knowledge in the ETHE field or systematic literature reviews concerning emerging technology and pedagogy in higher education, using advanced review methodologies.
The review committee proudly announces the top six papers deserving the ETHE’s High Impact Paper Award, listed in alphabetical order:

Abstract
This study investigates how engagement (E), foreign language enjoyment (FLE), and ambiguity tolerance (AT) exert mediation/moderation in metaverse-based foreign language learning (FLL). Featuring augment/simulation-based experiences and self-fulfillment/external-control-oriented mechanics, metaverse provides virtualized interactive circumstances involving individuals’ embodied presence/behaviors, aligning with FLL that emphasizes social interaction. Based on the quantified survey data, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses investigate the significance and positivity of the mediation/moderation relations. According to the results, E exerts fully positive mediation in the effect of intrinsic motivation (IM) on learning effectiveness (LE), FLE exerts partially positive mediation in the effect of classroom social climate (CSC) on E, and AT exerts negative moderation in the positive effect of E on LE. Notably, FLE exerts insignificant mediation in the effect of growth mindset (GM) on E. Therefore, efficient metaverse-based FLL requires synergies of affective factors, i.e., intrinsic motivation, perceptions of classroom social climate, moderate degrees of ambiguity tolerance, and engagement, for sustainable and long-term language learning progress in virtual interactive experiences. At the theoretical level, the findings extend the FLL-related models and advance the understanding of FLL. At the practical level, the findings provide references for more efficient metaverse implementations in FLL.
Introduction
Initially coined by Stephenson (
1992
), “metaverse” refers to a virtual-reality condition beyond real-life contexts (AlSaleem,
2023
). Etymologically speaking, this word consists of “meta-” denoting a process of transcending the substance into the corresponding virtual form and “universe” indicating the existing world (Kye et al.,
2021
). As digital media and the Internet advance in functionality and accessibility, integrations of metaverse and digital platforms are issues worth investigating from the perspectives of efficiency and innovation (AlSaleem,
2023
). Among the fields for digital-platform-based metaverse implementation, education reflects the effects of metaverse on individuals’ affective/behavioral/performative cultivations through interactions and communications in virtual settings (Qian et al.,
2023
). Although educators and researchers have accordingly been exploring the efficiency of educational technologies in learning, what differentiates metaverse from traditional digital technologies for educational purposes is that metaverse provides augments or simulations of the original situations and creates the corresponding experiences outside the traditional contexts (Kye et al.,
2021
; Puncreobutr et al.,
2022
).
Metaverse can meet the educational needs in higher-education situations (Dayoub,
2022
; Kye et al.,
2021
) based on its emphases on social interactions in virtual settings (Qian et al.,
2023
), flexible knowledge acquisition through a balance between learning efforts and leisure (AlSaleem,
2023
), and accessible resources beyond spatial restrictions (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
). That compatibility between metaverse and higher education raises individuals’ need to enhance digital literacy, i.e., the ability to skillfully utilize interaction-oriented techniques to attain learning goals (Gamelin et al.,
2021
), for efficient knowledge transfer and problem-solving (Qian et al.,
2023
). Since education is a reciprocal process rather than a receptive process where individuals just use digital technologies based on digital literacy, educators and researchers have been investigating the metaverse-based approach, i.e., the pedagogical approach to transforming original didactic procedures into virtual environments through digital technology (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Qian et al.,
2023
), to boosting learning in specific discipline (Jovanović & Milpsavljević,
2022
; Ryu et al.,
2022
). Notably, foreign language learning (FLL) is one situation where the metaverse-based approach can show its efficiency by promoting collaboration, problem-solving skills, and creativity (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
).
Socio-cultural theory and constructivism theory are the theoretical rationales for the feasibility of metaverse in FLL. The socio-cultural theory emphasizes the essential role of interpersonal interactions in efficient and successful learning (Lantolf,
2000
). Since metaverse can provide engaging experiences with synchronous interactions and competency-based training (AlSaleem,
2023
), interaction-oriented experiences produced by metaverse are consistent with interaction as the premise of FLL according to the socio-cultural theory. Besides, according to the constructivism theory, learning is a substantially social and contextual procedure during which individuals actively generate, construct, systematize, and retrieve knowledge (Vygotsky,
1978
). Since metaverse encourages individuals to construct language knowledge and discourses based on collaborative behaviors in virtual settings (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
), metaverse is feasible in FLL by fostering volitional knowledge construction through social interaction.
Interactivity, embodiment, and persistence are the characteristics of metaverse learning related to engagement (Abu-Salih,
2022
; Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
). Interactivity refers to how individuals can interact with objects, e.g., physical humans, avatars of humans, rubrics, and virtualized substances, to form metaverse experiences (Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
; Díaz et al.,
2020
). Embodiment refers to the process of symbolizing individuals’ presence and behaviors (Makransky & Mayer,
2022
). Persistence refers to the consistent operation of the metaverse components and settings through (re)connection to the virtual settings (Abu-Salih,
2022
). Individuals’ perceptions and utilizations of interaction-oriented metaverse components contribute to engagement (Lee et al.,
2022
) as the predictor of behavioral/emotional/cognitive enhancement (Chiu,
2022
). When the metaphorized forms can represent individuals’ spontaneous need for change/progress, the individuals can unconsciously participate in the metaverse-based experiences, reflecting the association between embodiment and engagement (Kye et al.,
2021
). Continuity of the metaverse contributes to persistent functioning and effects of metaverse experiences based on sustainable engagement in metaverse learning (Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
). Since the three characteristics of metaverse learning are associated with engagement as a critical premise of FLL commitment and FLL outcome (Aparicio et al.,
2021
; Ghelichli et al.,
2023
), engagement is the hint to link metaverse to FLL.
Engagement contributes to easy adaptations to the metaverse technology (Liu & Hao,
2024
) and the facilitation of learning (Zhang & Huang,
2024
). Regarding FLL contexts, E is associated with foreign language enjoyment (FLE), i.e., volitional pleasure of learning and using foreign language (Lee,
2020
), and ambiguity tolerance (AT), i.e., the degree of managing unfamiliar situations without frustration (McLain,
2009
). While FLE maintains individuals’ positive attitudes to learning for FLL progress (Li,
2023
), AT debilitates engagement in metaverse-based FLL through potential interference of uncertainty in learning experiences (Paralkar & Knutson,
2023
). Thus, E, FLE, and AT are the interrelated constructs and the critical factors conducive to efficient metaverse-based FLL associated with learning effectiveness (LE) (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
), intrinsic motivation (IM) (Xiao & Hew,
2023
), classroom social climate (CSC) (Mohammad Hossein et al.,
2022
), and growth mindset (GM) (Li,
2023
).
However, few studies have simultaneously investigated how E, FLE, and AT are interrelated and how these constructs influence metaverse-based FLL, reflecting the research gap as a guide for the current study. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to investigate how engagement, foreign language enjoyment, and ambiguity tolerance, as interrelated constructs, exert predictive effects on metaverse-based foreign language learning, eliciting the following three research questions (RQs) and the corresponding hypotheses (Hs) based on the subsequent literature review.
RQ1 (related to H1-H3): How does engagement influence metaverse-based foreign language learning?
H1: In metaverse-based FLL, E significantly and positively predicts LE.
H2: In metaverse-based FLL, E significantly and positively mediates the effect of IM on LE.
H3: In metaverse-based FLL, IM significantly and positively predicts LE.
RQ2 (related to H4-H8): How does foreign language enjoyment influence metaverse-based foreign language learning?
H4: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and positively predicts E.
H5: In metaverse-based FLL, CSC significantly and positively predicts E.
H6: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and positively mediates the effect of CSC on E.
H7: In metaverse-based FLL, GM significantly and positively predicts E.
H8: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and positively mediates the effect of GM on E.
RQ3 (related to H9): How does ambiguity tolerance influence metaverse-based foreign language learning?
H9: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and negatively moderates the effect of E on LE.
Literature review
This section provides the theoretical evidence of metaverse-based FLL contexts and justifications for raising H1-H9.
Contexts of metaverse-based foreign language learning
Metaverse reflects a three-dimensional virtual reality where individuals are transformed into the corresponding avatars who conduct daily activities and economic life (Liu & Hao,
2024
). For metaverse users, avatars enable individuals to engage in social and cultural activities by extending reality into virtual settings (Asiksoy,
2023
). For metaverse experiences, virtual reality and reality interact and coevolve into unified and synergized learning situations (Han et al.,
2023
). These engaging features contribute to numerous applications of metaverse in educational contexts with distinctive merits, necessitating a classification of these applications according to the “augmentation versus simulation” and “inner world versus external world” dimensions (Kye et al.,
2021
).
The “augmentation versus simulation” dimension indicates whether the metaverse technology provides the virtual environments by implementing further information in the physical contexts (Kye et al.,
2021
), aligning with the core feature to differentiate metaverse from traditional digital technology in educational contexts (Puncreobutr et al.,
2022
). Augmentation technology provides new function(s) as complements of the existing real world (Ryu et al.,
2024
). In the augmented metaverse experiences, individuals can interact with the further information superimposed on the physical surroundings (Shu & Gu,
2023
). In contrast, simulation technology provides a parallel virtualized form of the existing real world (Flores-Castaneda et al.,
2024
). In simulated metaverse experiences, individuals can perceive and participate in totally virtual experiences modeled from the corresponding real-life contexts (Onu et al.,
2023
).
The “inner world versus external world” dimension indicates whether the metaverse technology aims to prompt individuals’ physical changes through internal intimation of the individuals’ identities or external presentations of the desire for controlling information/context (Kye et al.,
2021
). Metaverse for the inner world emphasizes the identity fulfillment and behavioral maintenance/changes of an individual or object (Yang,
2023
). Avatar and digital profiles are indispensable bridges between the physical individuals and the virtualized environments for task completion in the inner metaverse world (Hwang et al.,
2023
). In contrast, metaverse for the external world emphasizes the information presentation in the external aspect of the physical world (Jeon et al.,
2024
). Mechanics and detections inspire individuals to control the surrounding circumstances through the information virtualized from the corresponding physical forms (Maghaydah et al.,
2024
).
Integrating these two dimensions contributes to four metaverse subtypes: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror world, and virtual reality (Kye et al.,
2021
). With the features of augmentation and external world, augmented reality refers to the metaverse application that expands the physical world into smart environments through location-aware systems/networks/interfaces and layered information in real-life contexts (Kye et al.,
2021
). Augmented reality is applicable to contents that are essentially difficult to observe or explain, fields that require continuous practice/management, and materials that demand high costs/risk (Harrington,
2024
). In FLL, augmented reality can be digital textbooks involving visualized presentations of substantially abstract contexts, prompt notes, interfaces based on clicking, or realistic presentations of virtualized objects (Kye et al.,
2021
).
With the features of augmentation and inner world, lifelogging refers to the metaverse application to capture, store, and share daily experiences/information about individuals or objects (Kye et al.,
2021
). In educational contexts, lifelogging enables individuals to volitionally participate in reciprocal networking and enhance adaptations based on customized feedback on learning achievement (Dwivedi et al.,
2022
). In FLL, lifelogging can be social media through which individuals communicate with others, participate in the topic-oriented language use processes, and perceive/judge/comprehend the illocutionary meanings through literal meanings of the shared contents (Celik & Baturay,
2024
).
With the features of simulation and external world, mirror world refers to the metaverse applications that reflect the physical world regarding its appearance, information, and structure (Kye et al.,
2021
). Internet or mobile applications pave the paths for transferring real-life pedagogical activities into the corresponding virtualized processes with ontologically external class information (Singh,
2024
). In FLL, mirror world can be real-time online classes conducted through online video conferencing platforms, which offer digitalized operations of interaction-oriented gathering for language knowledge receptions/productions (İbi̇li̇ et al.,
2024
).
With the features of simulation and inner world, virtual reality refers to the metaverse application involving a three-dimensional virtual world and digitalized data (Kye et al.,
2021
). Virtual reality for educational purposes prompts subconscious engagement in instant interactions between/among avatars that reflect the individuals themselves (Tsappi et al.,
2024
). In FLL, virtual reality can be online multiplayer games that metaphorize real-life classroom/communications into playable interactions based on entertaining images/settings/rubrics and transform individuals’ external-stimulant-oriented actions into spontaneous behaviors to make progress (H.-J. Chen,
2023a
,
2023b
).
Overall, this part has presented the metaverse applications in FLL, which include augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror worlds, and virtual worlds. Smartphone networks, wearable devices, online conferencing applications, and serious games supporting instant multiplayer interactions are the platforms to implement these metaverse technologies in FLL. These applications provide evidence of metaverse-based FLL contexts.
Relations among E, LE, and IM from the perspective of metaverse-based foreign language learning
Engagement (E) refers to active involvement and absorption in the target experiences/procedures based on spontaneous concentration and volitional commitment to learning objectives/activities (Chiu,
2022
). Engagement reflects individuals’ subconscious and volitional involvement in the learning procedures (Singh,
2024
), aligning with the engaging features of metaverse-based FLL regarding interactivity, embodiment, and persistence (Aparicio et al.,
2021
; Ghelichli et al.,
2023
).
The essential role of engagement in metaverse experiences is also reflected in the two metaverse dimensions. The “augmentation versus simulation” dimension necessitates the indispensable role of immersive experiences through superimpositions or parallel imitations, while the “internal world versus internal world” emphasizes the effects of engaging experiences on individuals’ affective/behavioral/performative change orientations (Kye et al.,
2021
). Augmentation or simulation forms of metaverse experiences cultivate individuals’ autonomy in processing/managing/controlling the learning conditions or their spontaneity in achieving learning goals through self-identification in the virtual settings (Flores-Castaneda et al.,
2024
; Ryu et al.,
2024
), reflecting the facilitating effects of engagement in metaverse experiences on learning attitudes/behaviors/performance (Celik & Baturay,
2024
). These statements reflect the justification of selecting E as the construct related to metaverse-based FLL.
The facilitating effects of E on learning are reflected by the benefits of learning performance (Zhang & Huang,
2024
). Learning effectiveness (LE), i.e., the degree to which a specific educational intervention is successful in producing the desired result(s) of learning, is the target construct to evaluate and quantify the potential benefits of pedagogical instruments/components/mechanics/experiences in learning (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Liaw & Huang,
2016
; Panigrahi et al.,
2021
). Since metaverse aims to produce purposeful activities/practices/interactions that require individuals’ engagement to promote authentic language learning (AlSaleem,
2023
; Lee et al.,
2022
), E is associated with LE in metaverse-based FLL. Additionally, engaging experiences enable individuals to receive, perceive, internalize, and surpass the provided activities for sustainable learning effectiveness (Xu et al.,
2023
) at the behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and agentic levels (Chiu,
2022
; Fredricks et al.,
2004
; Jang et al.,
2016
; Reeve & Tseng,
2011
). Metaverse provides immersive learning circumstances to inspire individuals’ volitional participation in adaptive and self-directed activities, fulfilling the crucial premises of effective learning, goal attainment, and performance enhancement (Abu-Salih,
2022
; Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
; AlSaleem,
2023
; Aparicio et al.,
2021
; Dayoub,
2022
; Díaz et al.,
2020
; İbi̇li̇ et al.,
2024
; Qian et al.,
2023
). Thus, engagement exerts the hypothesized facilitating effects on learning effectiveness (Almulla,
2023
; Qian et al.,
2023
), which provides the justification for H1: In metaverse-based FLL, E significantly and positively predicts LE.
Engagement is based on willingness/desire/volition (Shakhmalova & Zotova,
2023
), suggesting that an affective construct predicts E. The influences of metaverse on FLL reflect the integration of affective cultivations, e.g., engagement and motivation (Almusharraf et al., 2023), and performative cultivations, e.g., self-regulated behaviors for interaction and problem-solving (Almulla,
2023
; AlSaleem,
2023
; Chen et al.,
2024
; Rashwan,
2023
). Regarding the affective cultivations, metaverse involves the externally interest-stimulating components/mechanics, e.g., points, badges, and leaderboards, and internally encouraging motivators, e.g., a deep-level association between meaningfulness and behavioral change/progress (Chen et al.,
2024
), to guarantee engaging interactions and persistent involvement (Lashari et al.,
2023
). Regarding performative cultivations, affective cultivations contribute to individuals’ facilitating attitudes and autonomy in reciprocal language uses through meaningful communications (Fortuna et al.,
2023
).
The association between the affective and performative cultivations reflects the predictive effects of motivating settings on engagement that facilitates FLL. Explicitly speaking, intrinsic motivation (IM), i.e., the perceived need to fulfill participation/completion/attainment for spontaneous interest/enjoyment (Pintrich et al.,
1991
, p. 9; Xiao & Hew,
2023
), is the construct consistent with engagement that highlights spontaneous and volitional involvement (Chiu,
2022
; Liu & Hao,
2024
). Since intrinsically motivated states contribute to engagement through spontaneous pleasure and efficacy perception (Singh et al.,
2022
; Vezne et al.,
2023
), IM is assumed to predict E that influences LE, which implies that E mediates the effect of IM on LE and provides the justification for H2: In metaverse-based FLL, E significantly and positively mediates the effect of IM on LE. Besides, intrinsic motivation is conducive to the sustainable willingness to use language and enhance language mastery based on less language anxiety (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Alamer et al., 2022; Rashwan,
2023
; Singh et al.,
2022
). Since intrinsic motivation is a fundamental determinant of language proficiency (Alamer et al., 2022), IM is assumed to directly predict LE, which provides the justification for H3: In metaverse-based FLL, IM significantly and positively predicts LE.
Relations between E and FLE/CSC/GM/AT from the perspective of language learning experiences
The effects of metaverse on FFL are reflected through the affective states associated with engagement, the core feature of metaverse-based FLL. Foreign language enjoyment (FLE) refers to individuals’ volition to use/learn foreign language and their facilitating psychological states to manage, overcome, and outperform challenges in FLL (Mohammad Hosseini et al.,
2022
). Since individuals’ facilitating attitudinal states in educational contexts contribute to their volitional persistence in performing learning behaviors (Li,
2023
), FLE as a psychological state is a potential predictor of spontaneous involvement in the metaverse-based FLL. The positive attitudes to language use and learning inspire individuals to perform active behaviors to pursue a balance between challenges and current knowledge level to avoid distractions and guarantee engagement in learning (Jiang & Dewaele,
2019
). Since FLE can provide affective support for the cultivation of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, i.e., the qualities for engagement (Guo,
2021
; Mohammad Hosseini et al.,
2022
), FLE is assumed to exert positive effects on E in FLL contexts, which provides the justification for H4: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and positively predicts E.
Classroom social climate (CSC), i.e., the degree to which learners establish and maintain relationships with teachers based on social interactions (Mohammad Hosseini et al.,
2022
), is an engagement-related affective construct regarding individuals’ reactions to the learning atmosphere. CSC encourages individuals to cultivate volitional willingness to perform social-interactive behaviors and exert voluntary efforts to make self-regulated progress (Joe et al.,
2017
; Lee,
2020
), aligning with the requirement of social interaction for successful language learning according to socio-cultural theory (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
; Vygotsky,
1978
). CSC is compatible with metaverse-based FLL because metaverse offers collaborative language learning for secure and adaptive pedagogical activities in virtual settings (Jovanović & Milosavljević,
2022
; Ryu et al.,
2022
). Learning environments with higher CSC contribute to more engagement in pedagogical activities for greater knowledge productivity (Schiller et al.,
2024
), reflecting the potential predictive effects of CSC on E in language learning circumstances. That statement provides the justification for H5: In metaverse-based FLL, CSC significantly and positively predicts E. Additionally, interaction-oriented learning inculcates individuals with positive emotions for long-term persistence and sustainable development (J.-M. Dewaele & L. Dewaele,
2017
; Lee,
2020
; Li et al.,
2021
; Makransky & Mayer,
2022
; Shadiev & Wang,
2022
). Since FLE happens in collaborative learning circumstances involving interactive and immersive activities (Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
; J.-M. Dewaele & L. Dewaele,
2017
; Makransky & Mayer,
2022
; Qian et al.,
2023
), the cultivation of positive emotions through CSC reflects the potential predictive effects of CSC on FLE, i.e., the construct of affective states beneficial for language learning (Li,
2023
). Integrating the effects of CSC on FLE and the effects of FLE on E provides the justification for H6: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and positively mediates the effect of CSC on E.
Growth mindset (GM), i.e., individuals’ belief that language proficiency is improvable through external factors (e.g., efforts, strategies, and feedback), is another engagement-related affective construct regarding perceptions of language-learning success attribution (Hwang et al.,
2023
). Although the stability of GM for FLL is subject to language learning background, conditions for social interactions (Mercer & Ryan,
2010
), GM enables individuals to venture beyond their comfort zone for substantial growth in authentic language proficiency and adaptability to socio-cultural settings (Khajavy et al.,
2022
; Papi et al.,
2019
). Since GM-driven individuals’ facilitating attribution of FLL success contributes to their sustainable involvement in authentic language use as the reflection of persistent and substantial engagement in FLL (Li,
2023
), GM is assumed to exert predictive effects on E in FLL contexts, which provides the justification for H7: In metaverse-based FLL, GM significantly and positively predicts E. Additionally, GM-driven individuals can reinforce the associations between learning efforts and enhancement in FLL to achieve satisfaction and enjoyment through their ability to deal with language learning challenges (Bai & Wang,
2020
; Dweck,
2017
), implying the assumed effects of GM on FLE highlighting enjoyment (Li,
2023
). Integrating the effects of GM on FLE and the effects of FLE on E provides the justification for H8: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and positively mediates the effect of GM on E.
Ambiguity tolerance (AT), i.e., the degree to which individuals endure unpredictable and unfamiliar language-use contexts without frustration or discomfort, is another engagement-related construct regarding the potential debilitation of individuals’ involvement at the psychological and social levels (Yu et al.,
2022
). From the psychological perspective, AT would distract individuals’ attention from language comprehension/production to anxious identifications of (un)familiarity and (un)certainty (Chu et al.,
2015
; Moul et al.,
2023
). Excessively AT-oriented behaviors would lead to debilitating states for managing intricate language-use situations, e.g., timid, silenced, alienated, and demotivated states (Paralkar & Knutson,
2023
), reflecting the adverse effects of AT on engagement in flexible learning procedures and autonomy in dealing with uncertainty (Moul et al.,
2023
). From the social perspective, AT would decrease the sense of belonging to the educational contexts (Paralkar & Knutson,
2023
). Excessive AT would lead to anxiety that hinders conversational/interactive hints and social presence as indispensable factors for engagement (Aslan & Thompson,
2021
; Jiang et al.,
2023
). Apart from the potentially negative relation between AT and E, AT is assumed to be related to LE. Since AT influences the positivity and strength of the correlation between autonomy, i.e., one essential premise of engagement, and language learning outcomes (Chen,
2023a
,
2023b
), AT is related to LE as the quantified FLL outcomes especially through the interventions of educational technologies (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Panigrahi et al.,
2021
). Integrating the debilitating relation between AT and E, the influence of AT in the correlation involving E, and the facilitating effects of E on LE implies the potentially negative moderation of AT in the effects of E on LE. That statement elicits H9: In metaverse-based FLL, FLE significantly and negatively moderates the effect of E on LE.
Thus far, 2.2 and 2.3 have presented the justifications for the hypothesized relations among E, LE, IM, FLE, CSC, GM, and AT (see Fig.
1
). These relations form the model of how metaverse influences FLL through affective cultivations. The four types of metaverse applications mentioned in 2.1 provide the metaverse-based FLL contexts for this model.

Methodology
This section describes methodological considerations for this study.
Research method overview
This study conducts a quantitative method through a within-group experiment involving a survey to analyze the relations among affective states and learning effectiveness in metaverse-based FLL. The research guidelines of Saunders et al., (
2019
, p. 128) provide the rationales for selecting this method. Since this study aims to generalize assertions (relations between/among the constructs related to metaverse-based FLL) from observable outputs (significance and effect size for these relations), this study aligns with positivism as the philosophical assumption (Saunders et al.,
2019
, p. 144). Since this study aims to infer a conclusion (how metaverse influences FLL through affective cultivations) from reasoning (descriptions, interpretations, and discussions of the results), this study aligns with deduction as the theory development process (Saunders et al.,
2019
, p. 176). The within-group experiment design plans to investigate the relations among the metaverse-FLL-related constructs without grouping (Saunders et al.,
2019
, pp. 178 & 212). The survey design is a questionnaire, i.e., the technique for deductive and quantitative designs, to quantify the involved constructs (Saunders et al.,
2019
, pp. 178, 193, & 564).
Research tools and involved variables
Corresponding with the research design, the author conducted a survey. The research tools for this survey involved an online hybrid questionnaire, Wenjuanxing (
https://www.wjx.cn
) as the platform for designing/uploading/sending/receiving the online questionnaires, WeChat and QQ as the platforms to share the online questionnaires, and RStudio as the analytical platform for the survey results.
The online hybrid questionnaire includes two sections: (a) participants’ demographic information and (b) self-ratings for the constructs related to metaverse-based foreign language learning. Section (a) involves the records of participants’ consent for participation, gender (the variable “Gender”), age (“Age”), fields of study (“Field”), and subtypes of applying metaverse to foreign language learning (“Deployment”). Section (b) involves the measurements of E, LE, IM, FLE, CSC, GM, and AT, each of which is measured by four self-rating items (e.g., IM measured by IM1-IM4) on a 5-Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) (see Appendix). These questions are adapted from past study questionnaires to guarantee the accuracy of the content of the measurements. Questions for E, LE, IM, FLE, CSC, GM, and AT are adapted from the questionnaires from Jang et al. (
2016
), Liaw and Huang (
2016
), Pintrich et al., (
1991
, p. 9), Jiang and Dewaele (
2019
), Joe et al. (
2017
), Papi et al. (
2019
), and Chu et al. (
2015
), respectively. Self-rating designs enable the participants to quantify their construct states through the estimated consistency between their perceptions and the question item descriptions. Further statistical analyses were conducted to confirm the reliability and validity of the measures (see Sect. "
Reflective measurement models
").
Wenjuanxing was the digital platform that enabled the author to input the question items mentioned above and test whether the designed questionnaire could normally work. After designing the questionnaire and checking the settings, the author shared the online questionnaire link to the WeChat and QQ groups. When the participants voluntarily consented to participate in the survey, i.e., to agree to the consent statement, “I agree to participate in this experiment voluntarily and contribute my test performances and responses to the researcher only for the purposes of academic research. I understand that the results are anonymized and will be kept confidential in use.”, they finished the questions in sections (a) and (b). Considering the ethical statement, the survey did not record any information irrelevant to the research, and the author ensured that the participants were aware of the survey objective, i.e., measuring and analyzing the relations between/among constructs related to metaverse-based FLL, before the participants filled out the questionnaire. The survey results were analyzed on the platform RStudio (see Sect. "
Statistically analytical approach
").
Research participants, contexts, and procedure
Since metaverse is consistent with higher education highlighting interaction-oriented procedures (Gamelin et al.,
2021
) and problem-solving-oriented knowledge mastery (Qian et al.,
2023
), the author chose university students as the representative population for the survey. The survey finally recruited 686 participants, and section a) of the questionnaire recorded their demographic information as follows (see Table
1
). Regarding “Gender”, the participants are 377 females and 309 males. Regarding “Age”, the participants’ ages range from 19 to 28 (mean (M) = 23.109, standard deviation (SD) = 2.788). Regarding “Field”, the participants’ fields of study include philosophical sciences, economic sciences, law, education, literature, history, natural sciences, engineering, agronomy, medicine, management sciences, and arts. Regarding “Deployment”, the participants’ utilizations of metaverse in foreign language learning include the subtypes of metaverse application presented in 2.1: augmented reality (established smart environment based on location-based systems/networks/interfaces), lifelogging (technology to capture, store, and share daily experiences/information), mirror world (environment reflecting the physical world through appearance, information, and structure), and virtual reality (three-dimensional virtual world with digital data).
Table 1 Demographic information of the participants
Full size table
Considering the foreign language learning context, since the representative population is university students, university curricula allowing the use of educational technologies are the participants’ foreign language learning contexts. Featuring interactive relationships between students and teachers, university curricula are the target contexts for foreign language learning through idea-stimulating communications and cooperation-stimulating settings, reflecting enhancing foreign language mastery through interaction (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
). Besides, foreign languages in the research context include non-native languages for general uses, i.e., for general communication, or specified uses, i.e., for defining the terms or discussing the ideas specified in the study fields. Additionally, since this survey investigates the metaverse applications, the university curriculum contexts should be compatible with the use of educational technologies, e.g., mobile phone applications or digital teaching platforms, that enable students to experience augmentation/simulation emphasizing internal intimation or desire for control (Kye et al.,
2021
) (see Sect. "
Contexts of metaverse-based foreign language learning
"), reflecting the potential benefits of educational technologies through interactive and self-development-oriented settings (Xu et al.,
2023
).
The research procedure involved data collection and data analyses. The data collection lasted 4 weeks (from November 20, 2023, to December 17, 2023). Having finished designing the online questionnaire on the platform Wenjuanxing, the author sent the link to the WeChat and QQ groups involving university students. Participants’ voluntary consent to participate in the survey enabled them to continue with the survey. When the data collection ended, the author downloaded and organized the data (see Supplementary Material) for the data analyses.
Notably, before the data analyses, it was necessary to identify whether the nominal/interval-scale demographic variables, i.e., “Gender”, “Age”, “Field”, and “Deployment”, impacted the measures of the metaverse-FLL-related constructs. Thus, the author performed the Kruskal–Wallis H test to analyze whether group divisions by “Gender”, “Age”, “Field”, and “Deployment” led to significant differences in the measures of the metaverse-FLL-related measures. According to the Kruskal–Wallis H test results (see Appendix), since all the significance levels are greater than 0.050, the metaverse-FLL-related measures are not significantly different among the groups divided by “Gender”, “Age”, “Field”, and “Development”. These Kruskal–Wallis H test findings confirm that the demographic variables do not lead to great variations in the results in participants’ self-rated states of the metaverse-FLL-related constructs, providing the statistical rationale for further analyses through RStudio (see Sect. "
Statistically analytical approach
").
Statistically analytical approach
Structural equation modeling (SEM) is the statistically analytical approach that models and estimates the relations between/among the constructs based on measurement error inherent in indicators (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 4) because the collected data involves multiple indicator variables, i.e., directly measured variables (the self-rating 5-Likert items), as one of the measures of the corresponding constructs, i.e., variables not directly measurable (E, LE, IM, FLE, CSC, GM, and AT). Regarding the statistical technique for the approach, since this study aims to extend the established theories about metaverse-based FLL and complies with deduction for theory development (Saunders et al.,
2019
, p. 176), the partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM) method is the statistical technique to explain the causal relations between/among the constructs and interpret the potential theoretical extension (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 4). Regarding the analytical platform, RStudio is the integrated development environment for PLS-SEM analyses with the R language (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 32).
The PLS-SEM analyses estimate (1) measurement models, (2) structural model, (3) mediations, and (4) moderation. First, the estimation of measurement models investigates the relations between the constructs and their indicators, i.e., the questionnaire items (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 41) and presents the reliability and validity issues (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 76). Regarding the subtype of the measurement model, since the items are mutually interchangeable for the corresponding constructs that reflect the traits in metaverse-based FLL, the current measurement model investigations focus on reflective measurement models (Hair et al.,
2022
, pp. 51 & 56). Besides, the estimation of structural model, including collinearity issues, structural model relationships, and explanatory/in-sample predictive power (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 116), investigates the significance and effect size of the relations between/among the constructs and the persuasiveness of these findings (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 41). Additionally, the estimation of mediation analyses investigates whether and how the mediator constructs, i.e., E and FLE for this study, significantly bridge the effect of the exogenous construct on the endogenous construct. The estimation (e.g., for IM → E → LE) includes the direct effects, i.e., the relations between two constructs with a single arrow (“p
1
” for IM → E, “p
2
”for E → LE, “p
1
*p
2
” as the total direct effect), indirect effect, i.e., a sequence visualized in multiple arrows and reflecting multiple direct effects (“p
3
” for IM → LE), and total effect, i.e., the sum of the total direct effect and the indirect effect (“p
1
*p
2
+ p
3
”) (Hair et al.,
2022
, pp. 229–230). Furthermore, the estimation of moderation investigates whether and how the moderator construct, i.e., AT for this study, significantly influences the strength of the relation between the exogenous and endogenous constructs. The estimation (for AT in the effect of E on LE) includes the effects of the moderator (AT) and the interaction term, i.e., the construct covering the product of the exogenous construct and the moderator (E*AT) (Hair et al.,
2022
, pp. 247–248).
Replication of the study
This study can be replicated in the contexts aiming to investigate the potential relationships among engagement, learning effectiveness, intrinsic motivation, foreign language enjoyment, classroom social climate, growth mindset, and ambiguity tolerance in metaverse foreign language learning. The research aim can be further specified into the investigation of the potential mediating/moderating effects of engagement, foreign language enjoyment, and ambiguity tolerance on the other constructs related to metaverse foreign language learning (as shown in H1-H9), paving the path for extending the theories about metaverse-based foreign language learning.
The methodology regarding research tools, participant recruitment, and procedure can be replicated. The research tool includes an online questionnaire involving demographic information recording (e.g., gender, age, field of study, and the approach to applying metaverse to foreign language learning) and 5-Likert self-rating questions measuring the variables mentioned above. The sources of these self-rating items include Jang et al. (
2016
), Liaw and Huang (
2016
), Pintrich et al., (
1991
, p. 9), Jiang and Dewaele (
2019
), Joe et al. (
2017
), Papi et al. (
2019
), and Chu et al. (
2015
). The online questionnaire can be designed on the Wenjuanxing platform and sent to the WeChat/QQ groups for data collection. Participants are university students with educational-technology-equipped university curricular experiences in foreign language learning for general/specific uses. Educational technology is the contextual factor for the students to experience metaverse applications (augmentation/simulation based on internal imitation/stimulation for controlling) to foreign language learning. Regarding the research procedure, the survey lasts about 4 weeks for participants’ responses. The participants who voluntarily consent to participate in the survey can complete the online questionnaire. The participants’ responses are collected and organized for subsequent statistical analyses.
Data analyses are conducted on the RStudio platform. Having confirmed that the group divisions by the demographic variables do not lead to significant differences in the measures of the metaverse-related foreign language learning constructs through the Kruskal–Wallis H test, the researcher can conduct PLS-SEM analyses on RStudio to estimate the relationships among the constructs that cannot be directly measurable, i.e., all the metaverse-related foreign language learning constructs. During the PLS-SEM analyses based on the conceptual framework (see Fig.
1
), the researcher can estimate the reflective measurement models, structural model, mediation effects of engagement/foreign language enjoyment, and moderation effect of ambiguity tolerance.

). The squared values of indicator loadings are the measures of indicator reliability, i.e., how precisely the construct explains the corresponding indicators’ variances (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 117). Cronbach’s alpha, reliability coefficient rhoA, and rhoC measure composite reliability, i.e., how indicators of the same construct are associated with each other (Hair et al.,
2022
, pp. 118–119). The findings are as follows.
All factor loadings are acceptable for the values > 0.708.
All indicator reliabilities, i.e., squared values of the corresponding factor loading values, are acceptable for the values > 0.500.
Acceptable indicator reliability values indicate that the measures meet the demand for indicator reliability (Hair et al.,
2021
, pp. 77 & 83).
All Cronbach’s alpha values are acceptable for the values > 0.700.
All rhoA values are acceptable for the values > 0.700.
All rhoC values are acceptable because they are in [0.600–0.700].
All measures of composite reliability exceed the threshold visualized as the horizontal dashed line (see Fig.
2
) (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 84).
Acceptable values of Cronbach’s alpha, rhoA, and rhoC indicate that the measures meet the demand for composite reliability (Hair et al.,
2021
, pp. 77–78).
Analyses of validity include convergent validity and discriminant validity (see Table
3
). Average variance extracted (AVE) measures convergent validity, i.e., how indicators positively correlate with alternative indicators of the same construct (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 120). Heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) measures discriminant validity, i.e., how a construct is distinguishable from other constructs (Hair et al.,
2022
, pp. 120 & 122). The findings are as follows.
All AVE values are acceptable for the values > 0.500, confirming the convergent validity of the measurements (Hair et al.,
2021
, pp. 78 & 85).
All HTMT values are acceptable for the values < 0.850, confirming the divergent validity of the measurements (Hair et al.,
2021
, pp. 79–80).
Overall, all questionnaire items can provide precise and accurate measurements of the corresponding constructs.
Structural model
This part focuses on collinearity issues, structural model relationships, and explanatory/in-sample predictive power. Variance inflation factor (VIF) is the measure of collinearity issues, i.e., strong correlations between the exogenous constructs (see Table
4
) (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 117). The findings are as follows.
All VIF values are acceptable for the values < 3.000.
Acceptable VIF values indicate that all exogenous constructs do not excessively correlate with each other or produce biased estimates for the corresponding endogenous constructs (Hair et al.,
2021
, pp. 117 & 191).
This structural model does not present collinearity issues (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 124).
Analyses of structural model relationships include significance and strength of the effect paths (see Table
5
). T statistics > 1.960 or < -1.960 at a significance level of 5% (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 94) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) that does not cover the value zero (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 117) confirm significance in the effect path. The findings are as follows.
Three hypothesized positive direct-effect paths: “IM → LE”, “GM → FLE”, and “GM → E” and one hypothesized positive indirect-effect path: “GM → E” are insignificant due to t-statistics values < 1.960 and 95% CIs that cover the zero value.
The rest of the hypothesized positive effect paths are significant due to t-statistics values > 1.960 and 95% CIs not covering the zero value.
All hypothesized negative effect paths, i.e., “AT → LE” and “E*AT → LE”, are significant due to due to t-statistics values < -1.960 and 95% CIs that do not cover the zero value.
Then, the author analyzes the strengths of the significant effect paths. Ratio estimates closer to + 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative relationships between the exogenous and endogenous constructs (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 118). The findings of the bootstrap mean ratio (BMR) estimates are as follows.
For the significant direct-effect paths involving E as the endogenous construct, the effect strengths are IM (BMR = 0.331) > FLE (BMR = 0.319) > CSC (BMR = 0.161).
In the only significant total-effect path involving E as the endogenous construct, i.e., “CSC → E”, CSC exerts a strong effect (BMR = 0.340).
In the only significant direct-effect paths involving FLE as the endogenous construct, i.e., “CSC → FLE”, CSC exerts a strong effect (BMR = 0.559).
For the significant direct-effect paths involving LE as the endogenous construct, E exerts a strongly positive effect (BMR = 0.528), while AT and E*AT exert moderately negative (BMR = -0.156) and weakly negative (BMR = -0.052) effects.
In the only significant total-effect path involving LE as the endogenous construct, i.e., “IM → LE”, IM exerts a moderate effect (BMR = 0.189).
The author analyses the explanatory power to investigate how the aforementioned structural models fit the collected data (see Table
4
) (Hair et al.,
2022
, pp. 194–195). The coefficient of determination (R
2
) value measures the explanatory power based on the variance in the endogenous constructs explained by the corresponding exogenous constructs (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 195). The findings are as follows.
The R
2
values for E, LE, and FLE range in [0.250–0.500], reflecting moderate explanatory/in-sample predictive powers for these endogenous constructs (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 118).
The adjusted R
2
values for E, LE, and FLE range in [0.250–0.500], reflecting moderate explanatory/in-sample predictive powers for these endogenous constructs (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 118).
Overall, the structural model that does not reveal collinearity presents moderate explanatory power. The significance and strengths of the effect paths pave the path for mediation and moderation analyses.
Mediation analyses
The analyses of the structural model output six mediation sub-models (a-f) (see Table
6
). The characterization process of these mediation sub-models proceeds in three steps: (1) identifying indirect effect, (2) identifying direct effect, and (3) identifying the total direct effect and indirect effect within one mediation sub-model (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 235). The results are as follows.
Step 1 investigates the significance of the indirect effects and produces the following findings.
The hypothesized positive indirect-effect models (c) and (e) reveal insignificant effects due to the t-statistics < 1.960 and 95% CIs that cover the zero points.
Insignificant sub-models (c) and (e) in step 1 indicate that E and/or FLE do not significantly mediate the effect paths involving GM as the exogenous construct or E/LE as the endogenous constructs.
The rest hypothesized positive indirect-effect models reveal significant effects due to the t-statistics > 1.960 and 95% CIs that do not cover the zero points.
Significant sub-models (a), (b), (d), and (f) indicate that E and/or FLE significantly mediate the effect paths involving IM/CSC/FLE as the exogenous construct or E/LE as the endogenous constructs.
Step 2 investigates the significance of the direct effects, and Step 3 addresses the effects within the significant sub-model in Step 2. These steps produce the following findings.
In step 2, the author excludes the sub-models (d), (e), and (f) because they do not belong to the hypothesized relations (see Fig.
1
).
Only sub-model (b) in step 2 reveals the significant indirect effect from exogenous construct CSC to endogenous construct E through mediator FLE.
In step 3 and within sub-model (b), the total direct effect (“p
1
*p
2
”) is 0.179 > 0, and the indirect effect (“p
3
”) is 0.161 > 0. The product value of these effects is 0.029 > 0.
The aforementioned steps provide the criteria for mediation characterizations (Hair et al.,
2022
, p. 234).
For sub-model (a), IM exerts a significant indirect effect on LE through E, but IM exerts an insignificant direct effect on LE. Thus, sub-model a) reflects a full mediation of E in the effect of IM on LE.
For sub-model (b), CSC exerts a significant indirect effect on E through FLE, and CSC exerts an insignificant direct effect on FLE. Since both total direct and indirect effects are positive within sub-model (b), this model reflects a complementary partial mediation of FLE in the effect of CSC on E.
For sub-model (c), GM exerts an insignificant indirect effect on E through FLE, and GM exerts an insignificant direct effect on E. Thus, sub-model c) reflects no mediation of FLE in the effect of GM on E.
For sub-model (d), CSC exerts a significant indirect effect on LE through FLE and E.
For sub-model (e), GM exerts an insignificant indirect effect on LE through FLE and E.
For sub-model (f), FLE exerts a significant indirect effect on LE through E.
Further investigations for sub-models (d), (e), and (f) are not performed because they do not belong to the hypothesized mediation relations.
Moderation analysis
The moderation analysis concentrates on how the moderator (AT) affects the relation between the exogenous construct (E) and endogenous construct (LE) (see Table
5
& Fig.
3
) (Hair et al.,
2021
, p. 163). The findings are as follows.
AT exerts a significant direct effect on E (BMR = − 0.156), and E*AT exerts significant direct effects on E (BMR = − 0.052) (see Table
5
). These negative effects are consistent with the hypothesized negative relations.
At an average level of AT, the “E → LE” relation is positive (BMR = 0.528) (see Table
5
).
While every increase in an SD unit of AT leads to a decrease of the “E → LE” relation by the size of E*AT (i.e., 0.527 + (− 0.052) = 0.475), every decrease in an SD unit of AT leads to an increase of the E → LE relation by the size of E*AT (i.e., 0.527—(− 0.052) = 0.579).
According to the slope comparisons (see Fig.
3
), the effect of E on LE is weaker at high levels of AT, while the effect of E on LE is stronger at lower levels of AT. Thus, AT negatively moderates the effect of E on LE.
Hypotheses-testing
The following recapitulations of the previous results provide evidence of testing the hypotheses.
For the mediation structure involving IM, E, and LE, the indirect effect of IM on LE through E is significant, while the direct effect of IM on LE is insignificant. E exerts full mediation in the effects of IM on LE. These findings elicit the acceptance of H1 and H2 and the rejection of H3.
For the mediation structure involving CSC, FLE, and E, the direct effect of CSC on E is significant, and the indirect effect of CSC on E through FLE is significant. FLE exerts complementary partial mediation in the effects of CSC on E. These findings elicit the acceptance of H4, H5, and H6.
For the mediation structure involving GM, FLE, and E, the direct effect of GM on E is insignificant, and the indirect effect of GM on E is insignificant. FLE exerts no mediation in the effects of GM on E. These findings elicit the rejection of H7 and H8.
For the moderation structure involving E, AT, and LE, AT negatively moderates the strength of the positive effect of E on LE. That finding elicits the acceptance of H9.
Discussion
This section presents the significance of the findings at the theoretical and empirical levels.
Full mediation of E in the effect of IM on LE in metaverse-based FLL
Acceptance of H1 and H2 indicates that E positively mediates the effect of IM on LE, while rejection of H3 demonstrates that the mediation of E accounts for the dominant part of the total effect in the mediation model “IM → E → LE”. These findings are significant at the theoretical and empirical levels.
At the theoretical level, the full mediation of E in the effect of IM on LE extends the language learning model that emphasizes the cultivation of intrinsic motivation. Since intrinsic motivation reflects the autonomous control of minds to guide behaviors for goal attainments (Pintrich et al.,
1991
, p. 9; Xiao & Hew,
2023
), internalization of language learning goals, behavioral regulations, and responses to external stimuli is assumed to contribute to FLL progress (Alamer et al., 2022). Notably, metaverse as one educational technology can provide augmentation/simulation experiences to transform original daily experiences into autonomy-cultivating experiences based on internal encouragement and stimulation of self-discipline (Kye et al.,
2021
; Liu & Hao,
2024
). Since virtual settings created by metaverse require individuals’ sense of belonging and immersion (Asiksoy,
2023
), metaverse-based FLL requires engagement as the fundamental factor to be accustomed to the further-information-superimposed/synthesized physical contexts (Flores-Castaneda et al.,
2024
; Onu et al.,
2023
; Puncreobutr et al.,
2022
; Ryu et al.,
2024
; Shu & Gu,
2023
). Thus, engagement bridges the positive effects of intrinsic motivation on learning in metaverse-based FLL.
The extension of the intrinsic-motivation-oriented language learning model elicits the following implications. In educational-technology-based FLL, motivating components conducive to immersive experiences, e.g., avatar, digital profiles, and rewarding mechanics, are indispensable for individuals’ spontaneous willingness to develop learning (Chen et al.,
2024
; Lashari et al.,
2023
) and fulfill substantial learning development through behavioral maintenance/change/(self-)control (Hwang et al.,
2023
; Jeon et al.,
2024
; Maghaydah et al.,
2024
; Yang,
2023
). Since intrinsic motivation is compatible with engagement due to their emphases on spontaneity, autonomy, and involvement (Chiu,
2022
; Liu & Hao,
2024
) and indispensable for enhancement in language learning (Alamer et al., 2022), researchers can concentrate on the cultivations of intrinsic motivation for individuals’ metaverse-based FLL progress. Besides, since competence, autonomy, and relatedness are the components conducive to engagement (Guo,
2021
; Mohammad Hossein et al.,
2022
), educational technologies should provide various interactive opportunities that allow for voluntary and self-regulated participation in synergies of augmentation/simulation and inner world/external world (Xu et al.,
2023
), which contributes to innovative applications of metaverse in FFL contexts: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror world, and virtual reality (Kye et al.,
2021
). These four metaverse application contexts enable individuals to subconsciously participate in communications associated with language proficiency enhancement (Celik & Baturay,
2024
; H.-J. Chen,
2023a
,
2023b
; İbi̇li̇ et al.,
2024
; Kye et al.,
2021
).
The extension of the theoretical model also elicits advancements in understanding FLL. First, FLL is essentially an interactive process rather than a unilateral information delivery. Foreign language learners should actively participate in social interactions through meaningful communications to guarantee FLL progress. That understanding aligns with SCT which emphasizes social interaction as the indispensable step of language learning (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
; Vygotsky,
1978
) and reflects relatedness as one premise of engagement that facilitates FLL. Second, FLL proceeds with authentic language-use contexts as the condition of substantial progress. Authentic real-life environments reference the augmented or simulated learning circumstances that contribute to learning competence as the premise of engagement for learning development (H.-J. Chen,
2023a
,
2023b
; Fortuna et al.,
2023
; Qian et al.,
2023
). Third, for autonomous input and retrieval, FLL requires meaningful learning and cognitive pruning. This understanding is associated with meaningful mechanics of metaverse for autonomy as one premise of engagement for FLL enhancement (Chiu,
2022
; İbi̇li̇ et al.,
2024
).
At the empirical level, the findings reflect that metaverse-based learning contains motivation-stimulating components by expanding the physical world (Harrington,
2024
), encouraging participation in tailored networking (Dwivedi et al.,
2022
), providing real-time operations of interactive communications (İbi̇li̇ et al.,
2024
; Singh,
2024
), and embodying individuals into avatars in instant simulated settings (H.-J. Chen,
2023a
,
2023b
; Tsappi et al.,
2024
). These approaches enhance individuals’ subconscious willingness to use knowledge and make persistent progress, contributing to individuals’ volitional immersion in interactive experiences, tailored commitments, and sustainable passion for academic work (Almulla,
2023
; Aparicio et al.,
2021
; Chiu,
2022
; Ghelichli et al.,
2023
; Lashari et al.,
2023
; Shakhmalova & Zotova,
2023
). These statements reflect the effects of IM on E in metaverse-based FLL through the cultivation of autonomy, self-identification, and spontaneity (Celik & Baturay,
2024
; Flores-Castaneda et al.,
2024
; Fortuna et al.,
2023
; Ryu et al.,
2024
). Apart from the facilitating effects of motivation on engagement in metaverse-based FLL, engagement can exert affective effects on performative enhancement (Zhang & Huang,
2024
). Since metaverse features interactive mechanics associated with attitudinal cultivations (Celik & Baturay,
2024
), tailored interactivity encourages individuals to process received knowledge, output language, and overcome potential challenges in metaverse-based FLL (AlSaleem,
2023
; Lee et al.,
2022
; Rashwan,
2023
). Metaverse transforms from sheer stimuli-responses learning into internalization-oriented learning for better self-regulated and problem-solving (re)actions (Almulla,
2023
; AlSaleem,
2023
; Chen et al.,
2024
; Rashwan,
2023
) (Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
; Qian et al.,
2023
). Augmentation/simulation mechanics of metaverse contribute to individuals’ volitional (re)actions to knowledge input, sustainable immersion, systematic processing, and self-regulated output (Flores-Castaneda et al.,
2024
; Ryu et al.,
2024
), reflecting the process of cultivating individuals’ affective states, i.e., intrinsic motivation and engagement for volitional immersion, and knowledge performance, i.e., active knowledge input and output for FLL progress. Thus, in metaverse-based FLL, learning performance is the explicit result of individuals’ affective enhancements (Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Alamer et al., 2022; Panigrahi et al.,
2021
; Vezne et al.,
2023
).
In metaverse-based FLL, individuals experience superimposed or simulated language use through interactions with virtual-setting components/mechanics/rubrics and individuals represented as avatars. For instance, the symbolization of individuals’ presence/behaviors in metaverse settings contributes to their engagement and progress (Chiu,
2022
; Kye et al.,
2021
; Makransky & Mayer,
2022
; Qian et al.,
2023
). These language use experiences align with the emphasis on social interaction for language proficiency, according to SCT (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
; Vygotsky,
1978
). Since interaction stimulates individuals’ interest in participating in information exchanges and needs to enhance language, individuals foster need-oriented motivation for further development (AlSaleem,
2023
; Chen et al.,
2024
; Lashari et al.,
2023
). As the cultivation of motivation proceeds from the external regulation to self-regulation stages (reflecting IM), individuals achieve spontaneity in involvement and participation (reflecting E) (Singh et al.,
2022
; Vezne et al.,
2023
). Individuals’ spontaneous immersion in FLL experiences contributes to their perseverance in learning development and persistence enhancement in L2 performance (reflecting LE) (Alamer et al., 2022). Therefore, metaverse-based FLL can foster intrinsic motivation as a premise of engagement for progress in language proficiency. Engagement is an unneglectable factor in bridging the cultivation of intrinsic motivation and the progress in language performance in metaverse-based FLL.
Mediations of FLE in the effect of CSC/GM on E in metaverse-based FLL
Acceptance of H4-H6 indicates that FLE positively mediates the effect of CSC on E and that CSC can exert both a significant direct and indirect effect on E. In metaverse-based FLL, both “CSC → E” and “CSC → FLE → E” models are acceptable. Rejection of H7 and H8 indicates no significant relationship involving GM, FLE, and E in the mediation structure. These findings are significant at the theoretical and empirical levels.
At the theoretical level, complementary partial mediation of FLE in the effect of CSC on E and insignificant mediation of FLE in the effect of CSC on E extend the language learning model by highlighting the mixed effects of FLE in different mindsets. Since enjoyment belongs to individuals’ positive attitudinal reaction to learning and contributes to sustainable learning persistence/passion (Li,
2023
), FLE, as the perceived enjoyment of using/learning foreign language (Mohammad Hosseini et al.,
2022
), can inspire individuals to strike a balance between perceived language-use skills and learning challenges (Jiang & Dewaele,
2019
), conducive to engagement in autonomous learning based on self-confidence and sense of belonging (Guo,
2021
; Mohammad Hossein et al.,
2022
). The facilitation degrees of FLE differ in different FLL contexts. When individuals prefer harmonious interactions, they can show more empathy as the crucial premise of positive affection and immersive involvement (Joe et al.,
2017
; Lee,
2020
). In contrast, when individuals focus on attributing success, their excessive concentration on external factors leads to outperformance-oriented behaviors and ignorance of internal development, e.g., engagement, spontaneity, and internalization (Jiang & Dewaele,
2019
). Thus, although FLE exerts overall facilitating effects on FLL, the effects of FLL are related to the individuals’ mental orientation. Compared with an external-factor-oriented mindset, an interaction-oriented mindset can contribute to more significant effects of FLE on affective cultivations.
The extension of the FLE-effect-related model elicits the following implications. The effectiveness of FLL requires synergies of affective factors that contribute to positive psychological responses to learning (Mohammad Hosseini et al.,
2022
). Individuals’ perceptions of curricular interactions foster their enjoyment and engagement in language learning/use (Lee,
2020
; Li et al.,
2021
; Makransky & Mayer,
2022
), while individuals’ considerations of external factors would distract them from learning process per se and diminish their enjoyment (Jiang & Dewaele,
2019
). Besides, in FLL employing educational technologies, enjoyment is an important factor in bridging the perception of the learning circumstances and self-perception of immersion (Singh et al.,
2022
; Venzne et al.,
2023
; Xiao & Hew,
2023
). Enjoyment is the affective drive for cultivating engagement as the crucial factor conducive to FLL effectiveness (Almusharraf et al., 2023). Additionally, mental orientations do matter in affective cultivations in metaverse-based FLL. Social interaction per se enhances knowledge processing efficiency and productivity, which is associated with engagement in metaverse-based learning (Shadiev & Wang,
2022
; Shakhmalova & Zotova,
2023
; Schiller et al.,
2024
). In contrast, a success-attribution-oriented mindset is not directly related to engagement in metaverse-based FLL because metaverse provides virtual settings different from attributions in the physical world (Kye et al.,
2021
).
The extension of the theoretical model also elicits advancements in understanding FLL. First, affective conditions that matter in FLL require comprehensive rather than isolated interrelated cultivations. That understanding necessitates the importance of enjoyment in the activities provided by innovative digital technologies (Singh et al.,
2022
; Venzne et al.,
2023
; Xiao & Hew,
2023
). Second, individuals’ preference for curricular interactions contributes to FLL effectiveness. Metaverse featuring flexible interactions with materials/avatars through augmentation and stimulation meets the demand of individuals’ interaction-oriented mindset for sustainable engagement in FLL (Kye et al.,
2021
; Puncreobutr et al.,
2022
). Third, FLL effectiveness is subject to individuals’ mindsets that reflect individuals’ orientations and needs. Excessive foci on external components would counterbalance the effects of innovative experiences on FLL (Jiang & Dewaele,
2019
).
At the empirical level, the findings about the complementary partial mediation of FLE in the effect of CSC on E reflect that CSC emerges in affectively supportive learning contexts where individuals gain friendly and enjoyable experiences (reflecting FLE) and achieve engagement based on a sense of belonging, independence, and competence (reflecting E) (Mohammad Hosseini et al.,
2022
). Featuring secure and adaptive virtual learning circumstances, metaverse paves the path for cultivating CSC (Jovanović & Milosavljević,
2022
; Ryu et al.,
2022
) by cultivating individuals’ positive attitudes to interactive mechanics and communication-oriented activities designed for enhancing language proficiency (Li,
2023
). Besides, the affective cultivation involving CSC, FLE, and E can enhance metaverse-based FLL performance. Supportive learning contexts that prompt friendly interactions and positive emotions can foster individuals’ cognitive and performative enhancements: thought-activity repertory, self-discovery, and effective learning (Lee,
2020
; Li et al.,
2021
; Li,
2023
; Makransky & Mayer,
2022
; Shadiev & Wang,
2022
). Aiming to provide sustainable and volition-stimulating experiences, metaverse can exert persistent effects on affective cultivations associated with long-lasting learning performance extended to extracurricular situations (Abu-Salih,
2022
; Al-Adwan et al.,
2023
; Almarzouqi et al.,
2022
; AlSaleem,
2023
; Dayoub,
2022
; Díaz et al.,
2020
; Qian et al.,
2023
). Therefore, CSC compatible with supportive metaverse-based FLL contexts can predict learning performance.
At the empirical level, the findings about the insignificant mediation of FLE in the effect of GM on E indicate potentially insignificant predictive effects of GM in FLL employing technology (Khajavy et al.,
2022
), including metaverse. In contrast to the discussion above that the external-factor-oriented mindset leads to deviations from language learning procedures per se (Jiang & Dewaele,
2019
), the empirical discussion about the insignificant predictive effect is about its requirement of individuals’ adaptability to novel interactive learning settings (Khajavy et al.,
2022
; Papi et al.,
2019
). Since metaverse can provide flexible circumstances tailored to practical needs (Qian et al.,
2023
; Ryu et al.,
2022
), metaverse-based FLL would contain changeable novel virtual settings. However, GM, as an enjoyment-related construct of individuals’ perceptions of their language abilities/intelligence as an adaptable/increasable quality (Li,
2023
), requires frequent adjustments and adaptations. Therefore, changeable virtual settings of metaverse-based FLL lead to unstable states of GM, reflecting the insignificant effects of GM on E and FLE.
Negative moderation of AT in the effect of E on LE in metaverse-based FLL
Acceptance of H9 indicates that AT negatively influences the strength of the positive relation between the exogenous factor E and the endogenous factor LE. That finding is significant at the theoretical and empirical levels.
At the theoretical level, negative moderation of AT in the effect of E on LE extends the language learning model about the FLL condition conducive to the solid facilitating effect of engagement. Since AT decreases the strength of the positive relation between E and LE in metaverse-based FLL, this negative influence of AT is consistent with the past study findings about the negative effect of AT on language performance by overemphasizing uncertainty in language learning (Chu et al.,
2015
; Moul et al.,
2023
). For FLL contexts employing educational technologies, engagement is an essential premise of positive attitudinal/behavioral/performative states for learning achievement (Singh,
2024
). However, ambiguous and uncertain materials would lead to disengagement and negatively influence the efficiency of processing information/interactions/materials for the learning process (Yu et al.,
2022
). Excessive ambiguity and uncertainty also impede processing conversational/interactive hints and adjusting social presence in learning circumstances, although these hints and presence sense are conducive to learning engagement (Aslan & Thompson,
2021
; Jiang et al.,
2023
). Thus, an efficient association between engagement and FLL performance should be based on learning conditions with limited ambiguity and uncertainty in experiences and materials.
The extension of the FLL conditions beneficial for the efficient cultivation of engagement and learning outcomes elicits the following implication. In FLL conditions, AT is individuals’ reaction to uncertainty that decreases engagement (Chu et al.,
2015
; Moul et al.,
2023
). That implication is also valid in FLL contexts employing educational technologies, necessitating the control of excessively uncertain experiences/mechanics/materials to guarantee engagement for learning achievement (Shakhmalova & Zotova,
2023
). For metaverse-based FLL, ambiguous settings and individuals’ perceived uncertainty would lead to distractions and disorientations (Harrington,
2024
). Thus, metaverse-based FLL should proceed with explicit rubrics and mechanics to avoid aimless explorations that potentially result in deviation from educational purposes and disengagement from the settings.
The extension of the theoretical model also elicits advancements in understanding FLL. First, efficient FLL is based on limited ambiguity and uncertainty. Individuals can gain efficient information exchanges based on explicit rubrics/mechanics/instructions/presentations (Aslan & Thompson,
2021
; Jiang et al.,
2023
). Second, integrating verbal information and non-verbal cues can decrease ambiguity to guarantee efficient FLL. Augmentations and simulations of the physical worlds contain visual and audial information to assist individuals’ information processing for contextualized learning (Asiksoy,
2023
; Han et al.,
2023
). Third, efficient FLL is associated with cultivating individuals’ moderate tolerance and buoyancy to learning uncertainty and difficulty. Perseverance in learning adversities enables individuals to realize the inevitability of uncertainty and foster active problem-solving behaviors as the premise of efficient language learning (Aslan & Thompson,
2021
; Moul et al.,
2023
).
At the empirical level, the finding reflects that AT is the affective factor that demotivates individuals to maintain the positive association between engagement and language learning performance (Chiu,
2022
; Qian et al.,
2023
). In metaverse-based FLL, individuals’ perception and excessive tolerance of adversities/difficulty/uncertainty decrease their volition to maintain immersion in language use conditions with potentially ambiguous information (Celik & Baturay,
2024
; Kye et al.,
2021
; Yu et al.,
2022
). Debilitation in immersion results in individuals’ passive or reluctant attitudes/behaviors of information processing and language enhancement (Chen,
2023a
,
2023b
; Paralkar & Knutson,
2023
). Therefore, AT that debilitates E in language use would decrease the level at which E enhances LE.
Conclusion
This section presents major findings through the answers to the RQs, practical recommendations of metaverse use for FLL, and limitations for future directions.
Major findings
This study conducts PLS-SEM analyses to investigate how metaverse can facilitate FLL through the mediation/moderation of E, FLE, and AT in the effects involving IM, CSC, GM, and LE, associated with the conceptual model (see Fig.
1
) eliciting RQ1-RQ3.
RQ1 is concerned with the influence of E. Acceptance of H1 and H2 confirms the significant indirect effect of IM on LE, while rejection of H3 confirms the insignificant direct effect of IM on LE. Therefore, the answer to RQ1 is that engagement facilitates metaverse-based foreign language learning by exerting full mediation in the effect of intrinsic motivation on language learning effectiveness.
RQ2 concentrates on the influence of FLE. Acceptance of H4-H6 confirms the significance and positivity of both the indirect effect of CSC on E through FLE and the direct effect of CSC on E. In contrast, rejection of H7 and H8 reveals the insignificance of both the indirect effect of GM on E through FLE and the direct effect of GM on E. Therefore, the answers to RQ2 are as follows. Foreign language enjoyment facilitates metaverse-based foreign language learning by exerting complementary partial mediation on the effect of classroom social climate on engagement, which positively influences language learning performance. By contrast, foreign language enjoyment does not significantly facilitate metaverse-based foreign language learning in the mediation model involving growth mindset as the exogenous factor and engagement as the endogenous factor.
RQ3 focuses on the influence of AT. Acceptance of H9 confirms the negative moderation of AT in the positive relation between E and LE. Therefore, the answer to RQ3 is that ambiguity tolerance influences metaverse-based foreign language learning by negatively moderating how engagement positively affects language learning performance.
The answers to RQ1-RQ3 elicit the main conclusion: in metaverse-based foreign language learning, engagement exerts fully positive mediation, foreign language use exerts partially positive mediation, and ambiguity tolerance exerts negative moderation in the positive effect of engagement on language learning effectiveness. Metaverse-based foreign language learning requires synergies of affective factors, i.e., intrinsic motivation, perceptions of classroom social climate, moderate degrees of ambiguity tolerance, and engagement, for language learning progress.
Practical recommendations
The mediation/moderation effects of E, FLE, and AT in metaverse-based FLL necessitate interactive, motivating, and friendly experiences for substantial and persistent progress in language mastery and performance. Since practical implementations of metaverse are indispensable attempts to offer situations for efficient FLL, the current study findings elicit the following practical recommendations for effective implantations of metaverse-based FLL.
Educators can emphasize the long-term habitual development of language learning rather than exclusive dependence on external rewards as the reinforcers of learning behaviors. Although metaverse experiences provide motivation-stimulating elements/components/mechanics to enhance volitional learning behaviors, cultivating spontaneous and sustainable learning habits is conducive to persistent language learning progress. Since intrinsic motivation reflects the self-regulated state of learners’ information processing and output, metaverse settings can explain why learners learn the language and the long-term benefits of learning this language. Thus, based on the reasons and benefits of learning as guides to continue learning, learners would exert voluntary efforts to proceed with learning, reflecting the positive association between IM and E for the learning process. Educators should also moderately monitor learners’ use of metaverse technologies and give prompt interventions/guides to avoid technology misuse that leads to disengagement. Augmentation/simulation, i.e., virtualization of the original experiences, and inner-world/external-world-oriented mechanics, i.e., internal/external imitation of individuals’ identities in the situations/control over the situations, enable educators to transform foreign language learning into metaverse contexts compatible with FLL: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror world, and virtual reality.
Policymakers can concentrate on the substantial enjoyableness of the metaverse experiences for learners’ positive attitudinal states for active (re)actions to interactive activities in virtual settings. When metaverse settings stimulate learners’ genuine interest, learners gain positive perceptions of the technology-based presentations, confidence in technology use, and volition to perform behaviors in the technology-based experiences. Since social interaction is the indispensable premise of progress in language performance, the policymakers can allow the upgrading involvement of topics, components, and settings for metaverse mechanics to guarantee the adaptability to the contemporary learners’ tastes and needs, reflecting the indispensable role of FLE in efficient learning. Immersive virtual storytelling-based settings are another interaction-oriented and interest-stimulating design for metaverse compatible with FLL that emphasizes meaningful information exchanges, reflecting the positive association between FLE and E in interactive settings. Notably, the designs of the interactive settings should consider the difficulty of learning materials and processes. Excessive difficulty in language learning materials would lead to learners’ indifference to meanings and reluctance to proceed, reflecting the adverse effects of AT in the cultivation of E for FLL progress. Alterations of collaborative and competitive activities in metaverse experiences can foster their confidence in learning and raise their awareness of sustainable development.
Limitations and future directions
First, the investigation of metaverse-based FLL concentrates on higher education. Distinct educational levels would reflect different efficiencies of metaverse-based FLL implementations. Second, this study focuses on in-sample explanations of predictive effects of the affective factors. Humans’ complex behaviors would lead to flexible and unstable relations between/among the constructs. Third, this study does not specifically define which foreign language(s) are regarded as the target foreign language. Different foreign languages might require different metaverse-based interactivities and show different efficiencies of metaverse applications. Fourth, since this study investigates the non-native language learning contexts, the limitation lies in the curricular experiences where students learn the target language. This study does not address the cultural contexts as the factor of metaverse-based FLL. The relationships between/among the FLL variables are potentially subject to the cultural contexts of language learning.
These limitations elicit directions for future research. Future research could extend the coverage of education levels, e.g., elementary or secondary education, and language subskills, e.g., listening, speaking, reading, and writing, to investigate potentially different efficiencies of metaverse-based FLL. Besides, future research could consider the associations between the positivity and the stability of the mutual effects between/among the metaverse-based FLL constructs for more comprehensive explanations and detailed guides for implementations. Additionally, future research could address the foreign language learned in the metaverse-based FLL. Comparisons between/among metaverse-based FLL groups by different foreign languages are the approaches to demonstrating the efficiencies of metaverse in FLL more comprehensively. Furthermore, future investigation of the relationships among the metaverse-based FLL variables can be analyzable in different cultural contexts for university students’ integrated purpose of learning use, eliciting more persuasive effects of metaverse on FLL considering cultural perceptions and consistency.

Abstract
The value of generative AI tools in higher education has received considerable attention. Although there are many proponents of its value as a learning tool, many are concerned with the issues regarding academic integrity and its use by students to compose written assessments. This study evaluates and compares the output of three commonly used generative AI tools, ChatGPT, Bing and Bard. Each AI tool was prompted with an essay question from undergraduate (UG) level 4 (year 1), level 5 (year 2), level 6 (year 3) and postgraduate (PG) level 7 biomedical sciences courses. Anonymised AI generated output was then evaluated by four independent markers, according to specified marking criteria and matched to the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) of UK level descriptors. Percentage scores and ordinal grades were given for each marking criteria across AI generated papers, inter-rater reliability was calculated using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance and generative AI performance ranked. Across all UG and PG levels, ChatGPT performed better than Bing or Bard in areas of scientific accuracy, scientific detail and context. All AI tools performed consistently well at PG level compared to UG level, although only ChatGPT consistently met levels of high attainment at all UG levels. ChatGPT and Bing did not provide adequate references, while Bing falsified references. In conclusion, generative AI tools are useful for providing scientific information consistent with the academic standards required of students in written assignments. These findings have broad implications for the design, implementation and grading of written assessments in higher education.
Introduction
Emerging digital technologies have a long history in university education practice (Doroudi,
2022
). These include virtual learning environments (VLEs), augmented reality, intelligent tutoring systems, automatic marking and grading systems, and now generative artificial intelligence (AI) (Woolf
2010
). The adoption of technology into education (EdTech) and the recent incorporation or AI, known as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd), has been received with scepticism and optimism in equal measure (Rudolph et al.,
2023
). Generative AI tools use a type of machine learning algorithm, known as a large language model (LLM), that is capable of producing novel output in response to a text prompt. Familiar examples include ChatGPT (developed by OpenAI), Google Bard and Microsoft 365 Copilot (which leverages the Open AI GPT-4 LLM). A Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) is a sophisticated LLM that applies deep learning technology. They are ‘generative’ due to their ability produce novel text in response to a user-provided input and they are “pretrained” on terabytes of data from the corpus of existing internet information. They are called ‘transformers’ because they employ a neural network to transform input text to produce output text that closely resembles human language. Many consider generative AI as a transformative technology that will revolutionise industry, academia and society (Larsen,
2023
).
Many in the higher education (HE) sector are concerned that students will use generative AI to produce written assignments and therefore as a tool for plagiarism (Perkins,
2023
). The ease of access to generative AI applications and the simplicity of generating written text, may have far-reaching consequences for how students approach their education and their written assessments (Nazari et al.,
2021
). The rapid development and progressive improvements in LLMs mean they are becoming more effective at producing human-like outputs (Kasneci et al.,
2023
; Team,
2022
). The implications on both academic integrity and the development of student’s academic skills are therefore considerable (Cassidy,
2023
). However, there is a lack of research on evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs across a broad range of assessment types and across different disciplines within higher education.
The importance of the student essay, as a form of assessment, is still relevant to the biomedical sciences, while academic writing is considered a key skill for trainee scientists and many other disciplines (Behzadi & Gajdács,
2021
). Although the adoption of AI may address some of the challenges faced by teachers in higher education, for example the acceleration of marking large numbers of student scripts, educators must still ensure academic integrity is maintained (Cotton et al.
2023
) as well as assessing the ability or performance of the student. In the biomedical sciences, an in-depth knowledge and critical evaluation of the scientific field is often a requisite of written assignments (Puig et al.,
2019
) and an important skill to acquire for professional development. The performance of students in key marking criteria, such as mechanistic detail and scientific accuracy, are also valued by teachers to allow an informed academic judgement of student’s submissions.
Previous analysis of generative AI on university student assessment has been mixed in terms of comparative performance to student’s own work. ChatGPT performed very well on a typical MBA course, achieving high grades on multiple questions (Terwiesch,
2023
). ChatGPT also performed well on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) exam, equivalent to a third-year medical student and demonstrated reasoned answers to complex medical questions (Gilson et al.,
2022
). A larger study of 32 university-level courses from eight disciplines revealed that the performance of ChatGPT was comparable to university students, although it performed better at factual recall questions (Ibrahim et al.,
2023
). However, the text output in response to questions was limited to two paragraphs and therefore not equivalent to a longer, essay-style answer. Doubts remain as to the depth and accuracy of ChatGPT responses (and other generative AI tools) to more complex and mechanistic questions related to biomedical subject material.
This study aims to evaluate how different generative AI tools perform in writing essays in undergraduate and postgraduate biomedical sciences courses. In response to example essay questions, AI generated answers were anonymously evaluated with reference to the level descriptions from the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications in the UK (QAA,
2014
), providing evaluations of generative AI output across four levels of undergraduate and postgraduate education. The performance of three commonly used AI tools were investigated, ChatGPT 3.5, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing. Scientific accuracy, mechanistic detail, deviation, context and coherence were evaluated by four independent markers, inter-rater reliability calculated and written instructor comments provided on each output. The findings provide insights into the effectiveness of LLMs in academic writing assignments, with broad implications for the potential use of these tools in student assessments in the biomedical sciences.
Methods
Written assessment questions
Essay questions from four courses at University College London (UK), within the biomedical sciences, were used to evaluate the performance of generative AI. An essay question from each of the undergraduate and taught postgraduate years of study was assessed, equivalent to undergraduate level 4 (first year), level 5 (second year), level 6 (third year) and postgraduate taught level 7 (MSc), according to the level descriptors provided by the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) in the UK (QAA,
2014
). Escalating levels of student attainment are expected as the level descriptions increase, providing an opportunity to evaluate the performance of generative AI at each level. The essay subject material was derived from the undergraduate level 4 course ‘Kidneys, Hormones and Fluid Balance’; the level 5 course ‘Molecular Basis of Disease’; the level 6 course ‘Bioinformatics’; and the level 7 course ‘Principles of Immunology’, and were representative of the types of essay question that would be used in these modules.
The following essay questions were used to evaluate the responses generated by AI:
Level 4: Describe how the glomerular filtration rate is regulated in the kidney.
Level 5: Describe the pathomechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Level 6: Describe how bioinformatics is used in biomedical research. Please provide examples of how bioinformatics has helped in our understanding of human diseases.
Level 7: Describe the major histocompatibility complex II antigen processing pathway. Please provide details of the key molecular interactions at each step.
Generative AI tools
Three generative AI tools were evaluated, selected on the basis of student access and their interface with the two most frequently used internet search engines. The free version of ChatGPT 3.5 (built on a variant of the OpenAI transformer model), Google Bard (built on the Google Language Model for Dialogue Applications—LaMDA) and Microsoft Bing (leveraging the OpenAI GPT-4 transformer model) were evaluated (Aydin & Karaarslan,
2023
). Questions were submitted to each LLM application between 11th August 2023 and 9th September 2023. Each question was entered into ChatGPT, Bard or Bing without modifications as the following prompt: ‘{Question}. Please write your response as a 1000 word university level essay.’ No additional prompts or subsequent text requests were made in relation to the generation of the essay answer. For the level 7 essay question only, a follow-up prompt: ‘Could you list 4 references to justify your answer?’ was applied. This was asked only for the level 7 question in order to determine the overall ability of each AI model to generate references. No alterations in the basic settings of any of the generative AI applications were made in order to mimic the intrinsic functionality of each model.
FHEQ level descriptors
The FHEQ level descriptors (McGhee,
2003
) are widely recognised across the higher education sector as the benchmark standard for student attainment at each level of study and therefore provide a useful scaffold to evaluate the performance of generative AI. Particular reference to the knowledge and understanding component in relation to Annex D: Outcome classification descriptions for FHEQ Level 6 were made, as this criterion was most relevant to assessing responses to the essay questions (QAA,
2014
). In brief the following statements were used as benchmark statements to evaluate generative AI output in response to essay questions.
Level 4: “knowledge of the underlying concepts and principles associated with their area(s) of study, and an ability to evaluate and interpret these within the context of that area of study”.
Level 5: “knowledge and critical understanding of the well-established principles of their area(s) of study, and of the way in which those principles have developed”.
Level 6: “a systematic understanding of key aspects of their field of study, including acquisition of coherent and detailed knowledge, at least some of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of defined aspects of a discipline”.
Level 7: “a systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of their academic discipline, field of study or area of professional practice”.
Generative AI performance evaluation
Responses generated by ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing were assessed according to the FHEQ framework and marking criteria described (Table
1
). The following terms were used to evaluate text generated in response to each essay question: ‘Scientific Accuracy’; ‘Mechanistic Detail’; ‘Deviation’; ‘Context’; and ‘Coherence’, each marking criteria therefore mapping to the FHEQ descriptors. Markers were provided with the marking rubric and a percentage value and an ordinal grade of low, medium or high was attributed to each marking criteria, for each of the generative AI models evaluated and for each essay question across all four level descriptors. The higher the level descriptor, the greater the expectation for each marking criteria. Illustrative examples from generative AI responses were selected, to highlight areas of good and poor academic writing related to the prescribed marking criteria and FHEQ descriptors. In addition, assessor feedback comments on relevant aspects of the responses were provided.
Table 1 Evaluation criteria descriptions
Full size table
Each essay question was anonymised prior to marker evaluation, to avoid marker bias. Four independent markers were used to evaluate each generated output across all AI tools and all FHEQ levels. Marking criteria and model answers (not shown, supplementary material) were provided to all independent markers prior to evaluation. The inter-rater reliability (or inter-rater agreement) was calculated using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance with SPSS Statistics (IBM) software. The Kendall’s W score and p-value (sig.) were calculated for each AI generated output for each marking criteria, and for the cumulative criteria scores for each essay paper. The overall grade (total score) was calculated as the average percentage score of each marking criteria score.
Results
Firstly, an evaluation of the ability of generative AI to answer university-level essay questions, and an evaluation of the performance of different AI tools, was undertaken. The generative AI models evaluated were ChatGPT 3.5, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing. Essays were chosen from four courses within the biomedical sciences. Secondly, to evaluate the performance of generative AI against increasing levels of expected student attainment, essays were chosen from each level of UK undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate study. This equates to essays from level 4, level 5, level 6 and level 7 courses, which are equivalent to the three years of undergraduate study (levels 4–6) and one of postgraduate (level 7). The performance of generative AI was assessed my mapping responses to the UK FHEQ descriptors (QAA,
2014
), which set out intended attainment levels for each year of university study. Scripts were anonymised prior to marking.
Specified marking criteria (Table
1
) were used to assess the performance of generative AI, based on scientific accuracy, mechanistic detail, deviation and coherence of the essays produced. Scientific accuracy reflected the appropriateness of responses in terms of factual correctness and correct use of scientific terminology, while mechanistic detail assessed the depth to which answers explored processes and systems (including providing relevant examples) expected in essay answers from students at each FHEQ level. Deviation assessed whether responses were explicit and did not deviate from the original question, while cohesion assessed whether responses provided an intelligible narrative that would be expected of an answer written by a human. Each generative AI model was assigned an indicator of how well it performed according to the marking criteria, as well as a percentage for each criteria. The total essay score was calculated as an average of the marking criteria. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. This was applied to essay answers at all descriptor levels. For each AI response, instructor feedback in the form of comments was also provided, based on the specific marking criteria. Illustrative examples of AI generated output (in italics) followed by instructor comments are provided in the context of each essay answer (ChatGPT, Google Bard, Microsoft Bing, personal communication, 2023).
Level 4
For each generative AI model, the following prompt was used: Describe how the glomerular filtration rate is regulated in the kidney. Please write your response as a 1000 word university level essay. Essays were evaluated in relation to the FHEQ level 4 descriptor and the prescribed marking criteria (Table
2
). Four independent markers evaluated anonymised scripts. The inter-rater reliability and agreement between assessors were measured by Kendall’s coefficient of concordance for each paper, for each criteria and across the cumulative marks for each paper.

ChatGPT
For level 4, ChatGPT generated an answer with a high degree of scientific accuracy with only minor factual errors. The level of mechanistic detail was appropriate although the response fell below that expected of a first-class answer. There was little deviation away from the essay question or subject matter and the essay was written in a clear, precise and coherent manner. More context could have been provided in regard to the physiological importance of the subject. Of additional note was the use of American English, rather than UK English, although the summary text was considered to be of a high standard.
Examples:
ChatGPT response (accuracy): “This leads to a decreased sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa.”
Instructor comments: “This leads to an increased sodium chloride concentration detected by the macula densa.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “When systemic blood pressure increases, the afferent arterioles constrict, limiting the entry of blood into the glomerulus.”
Instructor comment: “I would expect more detail here on the mechanism of myogenic autoregulation. For example, stretch receptors in myocytes lining the afferent arterioles, opening of nonspecific cation channels, depolarisation, calcium release, cell vessel contraction.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “This mechanism provides negative feedback to prevent excessive filtration and maintain GFR within an appropriate range.”
Instructors comment: “Would expect (more detail) here that autoregulation only works within a specific range of GFR and can be overridden by various hormones, e.g., angiotensin II.”
Bard
Although the scientific accuracy was appropriate for a level 4 essay, the extend of scientific detail and mechanistic insight was lower in comparison to ChatGPT. Some descriptions of scientific mechanisms were vague or the information provided was repetitive. There was a lack of context with regard to the fundamental physiological importance of the subject material.
Examples:
Bard responses (detail): “ADH increases the GFR by causing the afferent arterioles to constrict. This constriction reduces the blood flow to the glomerulus, which in turn increases the GFR.”
“Aldosterone increases the GFR by causing the efferent arterioles to constrict. This constriction increases the blood pressure in the glomerulus, which in turn increases the GFR.”
“Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP): ANP decreases the GFR by causing the afferent arterioles to dilate. This dilation increases the blood flow to the glomerulus, which in turn decreases the GFR.”
Instructor comments: “Repetitive and lacks mechanistic detail.”
Bard response (context): “It is important to monitor the GFR regularly, especially in people with risk factors for kidney disease.”
Instructor comments: “This sentence lacks context, for example, in what clinical setting should GFR be monitored?”
Bing
The output generated by Bing in response to this question contained a lower level of scientific accuracy and mechanistic detail compared to ChatGPT and Bard. Furthermore, the response lacked context and there was little cohesion or logical narration to the output and the response lacked a clear narrative. Of the three LMMs evaluated, Bing generated an answer that received the lowest overall grade.
Examples:
Bing response (detail): “The distal convoluted tubule (DCT), which is located after the loop of Henle, passes close to the glomerulus and forms a structure called the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA).”
Instructor comments: “Good level of detail provided.”
Bing response (detail and context): “A low GFR indicates impaired kidney function, which can be caused by various factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, infection, inflammation, or kidney damage.”
Instructor comments: “Does not indicate the range of abnormal or low GFR. Good examples of disease that affect GFR, although these lack specific context and mechanism.”
Bing response (context): “Renin converts angiotensinogen, a plasma protein, to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs.”
Instructor comments: “Reasonable level of detail. However, ACE expression is also high in the kidney proximal tubules and contributes to angiotensin conversion.”.
Bing response (context): “ANP also inhibits the secretion of renin, aldosterone, and ADH and increases the excretion of sodium and water. This decreases the blood volume and blood pressure and increases the urine volume and urine concentration.”
Instructor comments: “No connection made between cause and effect. The two sentences are disjointed.”
Level 5
For each generative AI model, the following prompt was used: Describe the pathomechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Please write your response as a 1000 word university level essay. Essays were evaluated in relation to the FHEQ level 5 descriptor and the prescribed marking criteria (Table
3
). Four independent markers evaluated anonymised scripts. The inter-rater reliability and agreement between assessors were measured by Kendall’s coefficient of concordance for each paper, for each criteria and across the cumulative marks for each paper.

Full size table
ChatGPT
ChatGPT produced a well-structured essay, which contained a rational narrative with elements of contextualisation regarding disease and mechanistic context. ChatGPT out-performed Bard and Bing on this task, generating a reasonably high level of detail, with no major scientific inaccuracies. However, the essay lacked specific or appropriate examples and lacked a broader scientific insight that would be expected from students at level 5. In addition, although ChatGPT generated a convincing introduction and clear narrative, some of the language used was profuse and the output contained several generalisations. However, ChatGPT generated a convincing piece of academic writing that scored highly on context and coherence.
Examples:
ChatGPT response (context): “This essay delves into the multifaceted nature of COPD, exploring the interconnected roles of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance, structural alterations, impaired mucociliary clearance, genetic susceptibility, and epigenetic modifications in the development and progression of this complex respiratory disorder.”
Instructor comments: “Good introduction to essay topic and provides some context. Language is slightly exuberant.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “These mediators amplify the inflammatory process, attracting further immune cells and initiating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and tissue damage.”
Instructor comments: “ Well written and scientifically accurate. However, lacks details on which immune cells and which mediators are involved in this process.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “The resulting protease-antiprotease imbalance contributes to airflow obstruction, alveolar damage, and impaired gas exchange.”
Instructor comments: “This is a generalised mechanism. No discussion in the specific association of these proteins and COPD pathogenesis.”
Bard
Compared to ChatGPT the level of detail was lower and overall the essay lacked mechanistic insight and failed to demonstrate the depth of knowledge expected of a level 5 student. Bard performed well in providing a clear narrative and the standard of written text was high and plausible. The generated output was also repetitive throughout and lacked a high-level of context.
Examples:
Bard response (context): “It is the third leading cause of death worldwide, after heart disease and stroke. COPD is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including cigarette smoking, air pollution, and occupational dust exposure.”
Instructor comments: “Good. Provides epidemiological context but provided no definitive numbers etc.”
Bard response (detail): “However, the current understanding is that the disease is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including cigarette smoking, air pollution, and occupational dust exposure.”.
Instructor’s comments: “Repetitive—repeat of the intro.”
Bard response (detail): “COPD patients are more likely to get respiratory infections, which can damage the lungs and worsen the symptoms of COPD.”
Instructor comments: “No examples of respiratory infections provided, e.g adenovirus, influenza, RSV etc.”
Bing
The response generated by Bing scored lower in all categories compared to that generated by ChatGPT and Bard. The answer lacked mechanistic detail, context and key examples. Therefore, Bing did not demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and provided generic content, even though the written text was plausible, it lacked accuracy and coherence.
Examples:
Bing response (detail): “These cells release inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, that recruit more inflammatory cells and fibroblasts (cells that produce collagen) to the site of injury. The fibroblasts produce collagen and other extracellular matrix components that thicken and stiffen the bronchiolar wall.”
Instructor comments: “Correct but lacks specific detail on which cytokines and chemokines are involved in COPD pathogenesis.”
Bing response (detail): “The inflammation is caused by chronic exposure to irritants, such as cigarette smoke, dust, or fumes, that stimulate the production of mucus and inflammatory mediators by the bronchial epithelium (lining of the airways).”
Instructor’s comments: “Well written but generic and repetitive.”
Level 6
For each generative AI model, the following prompt was used: Describe how bioinformatics is used in biomedical research. Please provide examples of how bioinformatics has helped in our understanding of human diseases. Please write your response as a 1000 word university level essay. Essays were evaluated in relation to the FHEQ level 6 descriptor and the prescribed marking criteria (Table
4
). Four independent markers evaluated anonymised scripts. The inter-rater reliability and agreement between assessors were measured by Kendall’s coefficient of concordance for each paper, for each criteria and across the cumulative marks for each paper.

ChatGPT
The level of scientific accuracy and use of scientific terminology was of a high standard, and while some mechanistic detail was provided in places, the essay lacked specific examples expected from a level 6 student. ChatGPT produced a well written essay, with a clear narrative that could have plausibly been written by a human, scoring highly on context and cohesion. There was some revealing language usage (for instance the first example below), where colloquial or verbose text was generated, although in general placed the essay into appropriate context (second example), both in the introduction and the summary.
Examples:
ChatGPT response (context): “In the realm of modern biomedical research, the integration of biology, computer science, and data analysis has given birth to the burgeoning field of bioinformatics.”
Instructor comments: “Slightly colloquial in language used.”
ChatGPT response (context): “This essay explores the multifaceted applications of bioinformatics in biomedical research, highlighting how it has contributed to our understanding of human diseases through a variety of illustrative examples.”
Instructor comments: “Well written—Puts essay into context.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “Bioinformatics can be succinctly defined as the interdisciplinary domain that employs computational methods, statistical analyses, and information technologies to acquire, manage, and interpret biological data.”
Instructor’s comments: “Good definition.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “To make sense of these voluminous datasets, bioinformatics employs algorithms, databases, and visualization tools to derive meaningful insights, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of fundamental biological processes and their perturbations in disease states.”
Instructor comments: “Generalised statement, e.g., which datasets are you referring to?”
ChatGPT response (detail): “Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) leverage large-scale genotyping data to identify genetic loci linked to disease susceptibility.”
Instructor comments: “Correct—but you fail to mention the specifics of how bioinformatics achieves this. Need to provide relevant examples of bioinformatic tools/applications, e.g. GWAS Interrogator.”
Bard
Google Bard struggled with scientific accuracy and correct use of scientific terminology. The output contained several generalisation or superficial descriptions of key elements related to the question and performed relatively poorly on mechanistic detail and context compared to ChatGPT. The generated output also lacked a narrative and therefore also performed poorly compared to ChatGPT in this criteria. However, there was little deviation away from the topic of the question.
Examples:
Bard response (context):
“Bioinformatics is a powerful tool that is having a major impact on biomedical research.”
Instructor’s comments: “Generic statement—no context or indication of what this impact might be.”
Bard response (accuracy): “Bioinformatics can be used to design new vaccines by identifying the genes that are needed for a pathogen to cause disease.”
Instructor’s comments: “Vaccine targets are not necessarily the same molecules that are responsible for disease.”
Bard response (accuracy): “Metabolomics is the study of metabolites, which are the small molecules that cells use to generate energy, build structures, and communicate with each other.”
Instructor’s comments: “They are also the by-products of biochemical reactions.”
Bard response (detail): “Bioinformatics can be used to track the spread of diseases by analyzing genetic data from patients. This information can be used to identify high-risk populations and to develop interventions to prevent the spread of diseases.”
Instructor’s comments: “How? Be more specific in your descriptions. Lacks examples.”
Bard response (detail): “This information can be used to improve the effectiveness of drugs and to reduce side effects.”
Instructor’s comments: “How—you need to provide more details and specific examples.”
Bing
Bing generated a response that scored lower compared to ChatGPT and Bard, with several generic statements and an overall lack of scientific accuracy and mechanistic detail, with little evidence of specific examples. For a level 6 answer, students would be expected to provided key examples in the context of human disease, biological mechanisms and connections to the scientific literature. In addition, there was also some deviation away from the topic and the answer lacked coherence and a logical narrative, scoring poorly in these areas. Overall, Bing performed relatively poorly compared to ChatGPT and Bard.
Examples:
Bing response (context): “Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, statistics, and engineering.”
Instructor comments: “Correct. You could have expanded on the application of bioinformatics in biomedical research.”
Bing response (detail): “Bioinformatics can help analyze the structure and function of proteins, which are the building blocks of life.”
Instructor comments: “Generic statement. I would expect more detail in an essay at this level.”
Bing response (detail): “Proteins perform various tasks in the cell, such as catalyzing reactions, transporting molecules, and signaling pathways. Bioinformatics can help predict protein structure from sequence data, identify protein-protein interactions, and design drugs that target specific proteins.”
Instructor comments: “This is correct but this is basic textbook understanding. How does this relate to the different types of protein bioinformatic analysis tools available?”
Bing response (detail): “Bioinformatics has helped to elucidate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's.”
Instructor comments: “Good disease examples. Could you provide further details of what specific biomarkers have been identified, for example.”
Level 7
For each generative AI model, the following prompt was used: Describe the major histocompatibility complex II antigen processing pathway. Please provide details of the key molecular interactions at each step. Please write your response as a 1000 word university level essay. Essays were evaluated in relation to the FHEQ level 7 descriptor and the prescribed marking criteria (Table
5
). Four independent markers evaluated anonymised scripts. The inter-rater reliability and agreement between assessors were measured by Kendall’s coefficient of concordance for each paper, for each criteria and across the cumulative marks for each paper.
Table 5 Output summary in response to level 7 essay question
Full size table
ChatGPT
ChatGPT performed comparatively better than either Bard or Bing in response to the level 7 essay question, attaining an average grade of 69.75% (borderline first class answer). Once again ChatGPT demonstrated a high degree of scientific accuracy and correct use of scientific terminology, although specific points relating to key mechanisms lacked the insight of a level 7 student in places. Several mechanisms relating to the question were covered adequately and the depth and detail were of a standard expected of a MSc student. The essay was written well, with human quality grammar, syntax and cohesion. Some context was provided, comparable to that written by a human, although elements were misplaced or out of context to fully demonstrate logical narrative.
Examples:
ChatGPT response (context): “This essay delves into the various steps of the MHC II antigen processing pathway, elucidating the key molecular interactions at each stage.”
Instructor comments: “Good introduction—put the essay into context well.”
ChatGPT response (accuracy): “Within the endosomal compartments, the Ii undergoes proteolytic degradation, resulting in the removal of a fragment called the Class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP).”
Instructor comments: “Actually, CLIP remains associated with the MHC II binding groove, until it is replaced by HLA-DM.”
ChatGPT response (accuracy): “HLA-DM binds to the MHC II molecule and stabilizes it in a peptide-receptive state, enabling the efficient loading of antigenic peptides.”
Instructor comments: “Not quite. MHC II molecules are unstable without a peptide (or CLIP) in place. HLA-DM facilitates the removal of CLIP and the association with kinetically stable antigenic peptide, resulting in loading of peptide with the highest stability.”
ChatGPT response (detail): “The molecular interactions between trafficking proteins, such as SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and Rab GTPases, ensure the precise targeting and fusion of vesicles containing MHC II-peptide complexes to the cell membrane.”
Instructor comments: “Good, well written—but you could have expanded the series of molecular events that orchestrate this process.”
Bard
Compared to ChatGPT, the essay lacked mechanistic insight and provided limited context and few key examples related to the biological process discussed. In comparison to ChatGPT this answer was slightly lower in quality. Although the sentence construction was plausible, the answer lacked cohesion or narrative and the output produced less meaningful context to the broader scientific understanding of the topic compared to ChatGPT.
Examples:
Bard response (context): “Macropinocytosis is a process of engulfing large amounts of extracellular fluid, along with any antigens that are present. APCs express receptors on their surface that bind to the extracellular matrix.”
Instructor comments: "Sentence are disconnected. How is this interaction associated with macropinocytosis?”
Bard response (accuracy): “The endosomal compartment is a network of vesicles that are interconnected by tunnels.”
Instructor comments: “What do you mean by 'tunnels'? What is the correct scientific terminology?”
Bard response (detail): “Once the particles are bound, they are engulfed by the APC and taken into a vesicle.”
Instructor comments: “What are these specialised vesicles called, e.g. endosome, lysosome, phagolysosome.”
Bard response (detail): “This allows MHC class II molecules to bind to peptides that are generated by the degradation of exogenous antigens.”
Instructor comments: “Lacks mechanistic details here. What about the role of CLIP, HLA-DM and HLA-DO?”
Bing
Some context was provided in the intro section. However, the essay did not fully capture the complexities of the biological processes asked in the essay question compared to ChatGPT or Bard. There were also some scientific inaccuracies (for example comment two below) and was therefore below the standard expected of a high attaining student at this level, although Bing did generate reasonably robust scientific output overall.
Examples:
Bing response (context): “The process of antigen processing and presentation by MHC II involves several steps and molecular interactions that are described below”
Instructor comments: “Good intro section—puts the essay into context.”
Bing response (accuracy): “APCs can capture antigens from the extracellular environment by various mechanisms, such as phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis or cross-presentation.”
Instructor comments: “Cross-presentation is associated with the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, rather than the MHC II pathway.”
Bing response (detail): “CLIP is then exchanged for an antigenic peptide by the action of HLA-DM, a molecule that catalyzes the release of CLIP and stabilizes the peptide-MHC II complex.”
Instructor comments: “CLIP is then exchanged for an antigenic peptide by the action of HLA-DM, a molecule that catalyzes the release of CLIP and stabilizes the peptide-MHC II complex?”
Bing response (detail): “The Ii also contains a sorting signal that directs the MHC II-Ii complex to the endolysosomal pathway.”
Instructor comments: “Good—but what is this sorting sequence? Please provide details”
ChatGPT, Bard and Bing comparison
Across all four FHEQ levels, ChatGPT scored the highest compared to the other LLMs, followed by Bard and then Bing, although no discernible performance difference was observed as the difficulty in the FHEQ level increased (Fig.
1
). In particular, ChatGPT and Bard performed consistently high in all five marking criteria, while Bing tended to perform relatively poorly in scientific accuracy mechanistic detail, coherence and context, although performed slightly better in response to the level 7 essay question. All four LLMs showed a high level of conformity, deviating little form the subject material stated in the essay question. None of the AI models performed well at delivering key examples from the scientific literature or relating examples to the biological processes being discussed. In terms of essay structure and providing a clear narrative, ChatGPT performed better than Bard or Bing, with the latter models often producing lists of factual information rather than clear narrative and logical paragraph progression. In general, the marker agreement was high for all three levels of undergraduate essay questions, particularly for scientific accuracy, mechanistic detail, coherence and context, with some disagreement regarding the deviation criteria. There was lower marker agreement for the level 7 essay responses, although agreement was high when all five marketing criteria were evaluated simultaneously (total score).

The average marker score was calculated for each marking criteria. Data is presented in ascending order of cumulative score for each generative AI tool and for each output generated in response to essay questions at FHEQ level 4, level 5, level 6 and level 7.
The text prompt for each AI included an instruction to provide a 1000-word output. However, none of the AI models consistently provided outputs of that length (Table
6
), with ChatGPT generating an average essay length of 837, Google Bard of 619 and Microsoft Bing of 617, across all four FHEQ levels. Google Bard also falsified the final word count, thereby generating a discrepancy between the prompt and the output.
Table 6 Summary of generated word counts
Full size table
When asked a follow-up prompt to generate references for the essay text (level 7), none of the AI models were able to generate appropriate references from the scientific literature, although ChatGPT provided an explanatory paragraph. Google Bard provided genuine websites with relevant scientific information. Microsoft Bing generated references that were entirely fictitious, despite providing an additional, short description of the relevance of each falsified reference in the style of an annotated bibliography. Each falsified reference that was generated appeared consistent with standard scientific referencing styles, including author, date of publication, title, journal name, volume and page number. In response to the prompt: “Could you list 4 references to justify your answer?” the following responses were generated:
ChatGPT
“I apologize for any confusion, but as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I do not have direct access to external sources such as specific references. Therefore, I am unable to provide you with a list of references. The essay I provided is based on information available up to that point and represents a synthesis of the knowledge and understanding of the MHC II antigen processing pathway as of that time. If you require up-to-date references, I recommend consulting scientific literature databases, textbooks, or reputable online sources related to immunology and antigen processing.”

Discussion
The study evaluates the performance of generative AI tools in writing essays for undergraduate and postgraduate biomedical sciences courses, according to well-defined marking criteria and using the FHEQ level descriptors as a benchmark standard for student attainment at each level of study (QAA,
2014
). Three commonly used, and easily accessible, generative AI tools were evaluated, namely ChatGPT 3.5, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing. AI generated output was anonymously evaluated by four independent markers, based on scientific accuracy, mechanistic detail, deviation, context, and coherence. The study selected example essay questions from courses at different undergraduate and postgraduate levels—undergraduate levels 4, 5, and 6, and postgraduate taught level 7, to assess the performance of generative AI tools across multiple levels. The higher the level descriptor, the greater the expectation for attaining the performance associated with each marking criteria. Illustrative examples from the AI responses were used to highlight areas of good and poor academic writing with respect to the marking criteria and FHEQ descriptors.
Implications
Previous studies on ChatGPT's performance in university assessments showed mixed results, with ChatGPT demonstrating equivalent performance on a typical MBA course and on the NBME 3rd year medical exam, although it previously performed better at factual recall questions rather than long-answer formats (Gilson et al.,
2022
; Ibrahim et al.,
2023
; Terwiesch,
2023
). There is also some debate regarding the accuracy and reliability of AI chatbots in writing academically (Suaverdez & Suaverdez,
2023
). Evaluating ChatGPT’s performance, this study found that for all FHEQ level essays, there was a high degree of scientific accuracy, with only minor factual errors, and high levels of context and coherence in the generated output. Overall, the evaluation indicated that while ChatGPT demonstrated high scientific accuracy and coherence, improvements in mechanistic detail are necessary to meet the standards expected of higher order essays. This was the case for undergraduate and postgraduate biomedical sciences courses. In evaluating ChatGPT’s performance in writing essays for higher level 6 and level 7 biomedical sciences courses, the study found that the level of scientific accuracy and use of scientific terminology was high. However, the essays lacked specific examples expected from a student at these levels., although they were well written and featured a clear narrative that could have been plausibly written by a human. There were instances where revealing language usage, such as colloquial or verbose text, was generated. Despite this, the generated content generally placed itself into appropriate context. Overall, ChatGPT’s output demonstrated a high level of scientific accuracy and terminology usage and outperformed Bard and Bing. These findings have implications for the potential use of ChatGPT in student assessments within the biomedical sciences, suggesting a need for further student training on the strengths and limitations of LLMs for different educational or subject-specific contexts. These findings underscore the potential limitations of AI tools in providing scientifically accurate and detailed examples from the literature, particularly in addressing nuanced concepts within the biomedical sciences curriculum.
Specific responses generated by the AI tool, Bard, to prompts related to the level 4 and level 5 essay questions, scored lower compared to ChatGPT, with differences in the scientific accuracy and depth of the information provided by Bard. In comparison, Bing, produced a good level of scientific detail at level 7 but performed consistently poorly compared to ChatGPT or Bard at UG level and lacked specific context or failed to connect cause and effect. In the context of undergraduate and postgraduate biomedical sciences courses, such deficiency may limit the educational value of the AI-generated content, particularly considering the scientific accuracy and mechanistic detail required in order to reach high attainment levels. The expectation at postgraduate level would be that these students also engage with critical thinking and evaluation, an area that generative AI is thought to perform particularly poorly at (Kasneci et al.
2023
). The findings suggest that the three generative AI tools evaluated performed well at FHEQ level 7, which may reflect the mechanistic subject material of the essay question. In general, marker agreement was high across all undergraduate levels, for all marking criteria, except for deviation, which markers agreed less consistently on. Marker disagreement at level 7 was more evident and this may be due to individual marker idiosyncrasy and differences in academic judgement, which may be more pronounced for postgraduate level assessments.
Despite some limitations, the AI tools were able to generate essays that generally met the scientific accuracy criteria for both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. However, they also generated variation in the level of mechanistic detail, deviation, and coherence of the essays, with ChatGPT performing better than Bard or Bing, particularly in response to the undergraduate essay questions. Generative AI tools are also error prone, or suffer from hallucinations (Ahmad et al.,
2023
; Alkaissi & McFarlane,
2023
), examples of which were reflected in this study. Teachers may therefore wish to supervise or provide guidance to students when utilizing these tools for educational purposes to ensure scientific accuracy and sound academic writing, especially considering the value placed on such skills in biomedical and medical assessments, and professional practice (Ge & Lai,
2023
). ChatGPT 3.5 is trained on an online data set that excludes scientific databases and therefore cannot access the scientific literature. This was further reflected in the poor provision of scientific references, although this aspect of certain generative AI models has been well documented (Fuchs,
2023
). Training students in the appropriate use of generative AI technologies should also be a high priority for programmes and institutions. Such guidance should also be placed into the context of institutional academic integrity policies and the ethical use of AI more broadly.
Limitations
The current study was limited to comparing generative AI output between different AI tools and did not provide further comparisons with student generated text at equivalent levels. Although papers were anonymised prior to marking in the current study, blinded evaluations that directly compare AI and human responses would further elucidate the strengths and limitations of generative AI in this context. Further investigations on the impact of generative AI tools on academic writing and plagiarism in higher education, would be valuable in evaluating the potential consequences and challenges in maintaining academic integrity in student assessments. Similar research on the suitability of generative AI for diverse types of assessments, such as other long-form answers, short-answer questions and multiple-choice questions, would provide a better understanding of the limitations and possibilities of AI-generated content in meeting assessment requirements. Furthermore, the potential for integrating generative AI tools in the design and grading of written assessments, exploring the role of AI in providing efficient, fair, and accurate feedback to students, including within the context of peer review, and using AI to develop academic skills and critical thinking are areas of potential research.
Conclusion
Large language models have wide-ranging utilities in educational settings and could assist both teachers and students in a variety of learning tasks. This study evaluated the output of three commonly used generative AI tool across all levels of undergraduate and taught postgraduate biomedical science course essay assessments. ChatGPT performed better than Bard and Bing at all FHEQ levels, and across all marking criteria. Although all three generative AI tools generated output that was coherent and written to human standards, deficiencies were particularly evident in scientific accuracy, mechanistic detail and scientific exemplars from the literature. The findings suggest that generative AI tools can deliver the depth and accuracy expected in higher education assessments, highlighting their capabilities as academic writing tools. LLMs are continuously being updated, and new versions of AI technologies and applications are released regularly, which are likely to demonstrate improvements in the quality of generated output. This has implications for the way students use AI in their education and may influence how higher education institutions implement their policies on the use of generative AI. Finally, these findings may have broad implications for higher education teachers regarding the design of written assessments and maintaining academic integrity in the context of the rapid evolution of generative AI technologies.

Abstract
This study investigates the efficacy of six major Generative AI (GenAI) text detectors when confronted with machine-generated content modified to evade detection (n = 805). We compare these detectors to assess their reliability in identifying AI-generated text in educational settings, where they are increasingly used to address academic integrity concerns. Results show significant reductions in detector accuracy (17.4%) when faced with simple techniques to manipulate the AI generated content. The varying performances of GenAI tools and detectors indicate they cannot currently be recommended for determining academic integrity violations due to accuracy limitations and the potential for false accusation which undermines inclusive and fair assessment practices. However, these tools may support learning and academic integrity when used non-punitively. This study aims to guide educators and institutions in the critical implementation of AI text detectors in higher education, highlighting the importance of exploring alternatives to maintain inclusivity in the face of emerging technologies.
Introduction
Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to paradigm-shifting applications and technologies which have significantly impacted multiple aspects of society. The ‘AI Spring’ (Manyika & Bughin,
2019
) of the early 2020s and its ongoing consequences have already garnered a great deal of attention in academia and education in a short span of time. At the time of writing, AI is receiving greater adoption both formally and informally among students and teachers and has become a ‘hot topic’ (Cotton et al.,
2023
), of which our understanding is only just beginning. Generative AI (GenAI) tools, that is, those which produce an output of some form in response to user input, whether text, audio, image, or video, have attracted the most attention in this area. Despite many proclaiming the potential benefits of these tools in aiding learning, GenAI also presents several risks, including equity and inclusion in education. For example, students and scholars with access to paid GenAI tools may reap more benefits than those who cannot afford subscription fees, thus impacting educational equity. Furthermore, punitive policies against GenAI use at universities and schools may disproportionately affect those who require assistance with academic writing, thereby affecting inclusion. Despite such risks, a consensus on the acceptance of GenAI in some spheres of academia is emerging. For example, many academic publishers have moved towards a position which accepts the use of GenAI in crafting manuscripts, albeit with certain restrictions (Perkins & Roe,
2024a
), and studies have shown the rising popularity of using GenAI tools to support academic writing and research (Bedington et al.,
2024
; Chan,
2023
; Perkins & Roe,
2024b
; Sobaih,
2024
). Simultaneously, a growing number of organisational bodies are now producing guidelines for the ethical use of GenAI in education (Foltynek et al.,
2023
; Miao & Holmes,
2023
).
Regarding inequality and inclusion, the consensus acceptance of GenAI tools in scientific publishing may disadvantage certain groups of students and researchers. For example, barriers in access to the internet, financial barriers in accessing paid GenAI tools (as premium versions often require a subscription), and other issues of access (for example, disability) all play a role in worsening ‘digital poverty’ (Miao & Holmes,
2023
). Further, Bissessar (
2023
) also identifies the digital divide as an important consideration in the use of GenAI tools in classroom settings and Liang (
2023
) recognises that GenAI tools are known for producing structurally biased and ethnocentric worldviews.
This is not the only concern regarding GenAI technology in HE. Shortly after the rapid increase in the popularity of GenAI tools caused by the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, detection tools were released commercially, claiming that textual GenAI outputs could be detected. We refer to these as GenAI text detectors. Many of these detectors claim a high degree of reliability in identifying the presence of AI-generated content in submissions, often giving either a percentage score (i.e. ‘this text is 10% AI-generated’) or a likelihood score (i.e. ‘this text is likely to be AI-generated’). Underlying the principle of these detectors is the assumption that by identifying GenAI text, assessors and educators can ensure fair and secure assessment. Research has shown that the assuredness of fairness and equity is vital for inclusive assessment practices (Morris et al.,
2019
), and notions of fairness and security suggest that students will not be able to misrepresent authorship and thus gain educational outcomes that they have not earned.
However, research has shown that GenAI text detectors have the potential to be barriers to inclusive assessment practices by disproportionately targeting individuals who do not speak English as their first language, or those with lower English proficiency (Liang et al.,
2023
). In this study, we use the term ‘Non-Native English Speaker’ (NNES) to refer to this population. We recognise that there are various terms used to describe individuals who do not speak English as their first language, such as English Language Learner (ELL), English as a Second Language (ESL) speaker, and English as an Additional Language (EAL) speaker, with each term having its own merits and limitations. While NNES may be seen as problematic by some because it categorises people based on what they are not, rather than what they are, we have chosen to use this term in our study because our primary focus is on exploring biases specifically related to these groups, and in this context believe NNES to be the most accurate and direct term to describe our target population.
It has long been known that NNES face challenges when participating in science. These ‘manifold costs’ include spending a greater amount of effort and time reading, writing, and disseminating work (Amano et al.,
2023
). Even when NNES do not use GenAI tools, research suggests that they are likely to suffer false accusations. Liang et al (
2023
) found that GenAI text detectors falsely detect NNES writers’ outputs as AI-generated due to the lower level of perplexity and lower coherence often found in NNES writing. As a result, linguistic measures, such as perplexity, as indicators of GenAI, are associated with bias against NNES (Liang et al.,
2023
). Following this, although GenAI detectors are borne from a place of good intention, that is, primarily to limit the ability of individuals to commit AI-enabled academic integrity violations and to understand how students use GenAI, and to ensure fairness and parity in assessment submissions, thus promoting inclusivity and fairness, they have unintended, paradoxical consequences. Most concerning among these is that they can be used to generate false accusations of academic dishonesty, create confusion or heightened anxiety among students, and disadvantage some groups of students (e.g. NNES) in comparison to others.
To assess whether the benefits GenAI text detectors provide to the educational process (ensuring fairness by limiting the scope of AI-enabled authorship misrepresentation) outweigh their potential to drive inequalities (false accusations of NNES, potential for students with technological ability, and financial resources to bypass detection systems), we investigate the efficacy of six GenAI text detectors. We do this by testing content subjected to prompting techniques that alter the standard output of GenAI tools to disguise that they are AI-generated texts. We refer to these manipulation techniques designed to evade detection as ‘adversarial techniques’ in reference to the combination of methods that have been referred to as adversarial attacks in the extant literature related to attacks on machine learning based tools (Alsmadi et al.,
2021
; Qiu et al.,
2019
; Sadasivan et al.,
2023
; Wang et al.,
2023
). This contributes to the understanding of the limitations of such AI text detector tools in light of their risks to inclusivity in educational practice, given that prior research has not investigated the impact of adversarial techniques on the ability of AI text detectors to maintain a reliable detection accuracy rate.
Our research takes place during a pivotal time in the release and adoption of AI and GenAI tools in education globally, during the first academic year following the release of the Foundation Model (FM) GPT-4 by OpenAI. This model represented a step-change in the abilities of GenAI to create text that was significantly more difficult to detect by educators (Fleckenstein et al.,
2024
; Perkins et al.,
2023
), and thus the technology began to draw greater attention in the public sphere, as well as in educational contexts. At the same time, this research takes place during an era in which there is a high degree of variability in awareness and understanding of GenAI, and a transitional period during which many instructors, students, and administrators have yet to receive training on the uses and limitations of AI tools.
Objectives
The overarching aim of this research is not to vilify the use of GenAI tools or AI text detectors, but to explore the efficacy and sensitivity of these tools to linguistic changes and adversarial prompting techniques, thereby assessing their ability or inability to foster an inclusive system of education. By ‘inclusivity’ we refer to providing equal opportunities to all who participate in the educational process and ensuring that no group of students is at a disadvantage through a lack of opportunity or unfair assessment process. By measuring the susceptibility of existing AI text detectors to various adversarial techniques and assessing their efficacy, we can draw conclusions about their suitability for use in higher education and their ability to enable inclusive practices by reducing the risk of academic misconduct or detracting from inclusivity through unreliability (thus leading to a higher likelihood of false positives). In doing so, this research aims to serve as a guide for educators and institutions regarding the use of AI text detectors.
To achieve these objectives, this study explores whether AI text detectors can be considered reliable tools which contribute to academic integrity and support in fostering inclusivity and fairness. Despite growing interest in AI text detectors, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that evaluate their performance against various GenAI tools and adversarial techniques, particularly in the context of educational inclusivity and equity. This gap in knowledge hinders educators’ ability to make informed decisions about implementing these tools in higher education settings. Our study aims to address this gap by providing a systematic analysis of AI text detectors’ efficacy and their potential impact on inclusive education practices.
Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions.
1.
Reliability of AI text detectors
: To what extent can we trust the results of AI text detectors to accurately determine the source of a piece of text? What implications does this have for inclusive assessment practices?
2.
Adversarial techniques
: Is it possible to disguise AI-generated content using adversarial techniques in prompting strategies and paraphrasing? What are the most effective adversarial techniques for deceiving text detectors? How might this advantage some writers over others?
3.
Comparative analysis of AI tools
: Which AI tools provide outputs that are easier or more challenging for detectors to identify? What are the implications of this?
4.
Detector efficacy
: Which AI text detectors show more promise in terms of accuracy and reliability? Is it possible to recommend any of them based on their performance?
Literature
Generative AI tools
In relation to GenAI, educators and researchers are currently grappling with the changes brought about by the popularisation and development of Foundation Models (FMs). These models share the fundamental capability of generating human-like texts in response to natural language prompts, a feature that enables a wide range of applications, and this study focuses on the outputs created by three popular FMs: GPT-4 by OpenAI (accessed through the ChatGPT interface), Bard (now known as Gemini) by Google, and Claude 2 by Anthropic. By manipulating FM text output, and evaluating the performance of AI text detection technology, we address an educational problem. Namely, that if such detectors can be evaded, this significantly affects their utility. AI text detectors will then not be able to ensure a fair, equitable protocol in AI-restricted assessments. Furthermore, despite having little utility, these detection technologies may negatively impact inclusion and equity by being biased towards certain student groups, such as Non-Native English Speakers (NNES). FMs are challenging because their output has shown a high level of accuracy when used to generate answers to educational assessment items. In an evaluation of GPT-4, Claude 2, and Bard’s performance, Borji and Mohammadian (
2023
) identified GPT-4 as providing correct answers to standardised questions 84% of the time, while Claude 2 and Bard achieved scores of 64.5% and 62.4%, respectively. In the multiple-choice section of the Bar exam, Claude 2 excelled with a 76.5% accuracy rate, surpassing GPT-4’s previous record of 75%. For tasks involving multistep reasoning, Fu et al. (
2022
) concluded that Claude 2’s performance is comparable to that of GPT-4, with Lin and Chen (
2023
), claiming that Claude 2 slightly outperforms GPT-4. Despite these achievements, Claude 2 lags in scientific writing and quantitative accuracy compared to other models (Chang et al.,
2023
; Lozić & Štular,
2023
; Z. Wu et al.,
2023
), primarily because of the ability of GPT-4 and Bard to access the internet for information gathering. Studies by Fu et al. (
2022
) and Lin and Chen (
2023
) have shown that Claude 2 can perform comparably to or even slightly outperform GPT-4 in multistep reasoning and dialogue.
Efficacy of GenAI text detection tools
There is a wide range of software available which has been designed to classify whether the text is machine or human-generated, with providers claiming high levels of accuracy in being able to identify whether the text is written by a human or by a GenAI tool (GPTZero, n.d.; Turnitin,
2023
). While some of these tools are free and others require either registration or payment, research by Walters (
2023
) has identified that the accuracy of paid-for tools is only slightly higher than that of free versions. However, claims of accuracy are contradicted by studies which demonstrate the varied levels of the detectors’ ability to distinguish accurately between AI and human-generated content. (Chaka,
2023a
; Gao et al.,
2022
; Krishna et al.,
2023
; Orenstrakh et al.,
2023
; Perkins et al.,
2023
; Walters,
2023
; Weber-Wulff et al.,
2023
).
Detection tool biases against NNES have been highlighted as a potential issue of bias by Fröhling and Zubiaga (
2021
) and Liang et al. (
2023
) because of their reliance on standardised linguistic metrics such as perplexity and burstiness, which can disadvantage NNES. Liang et al. (
2023
), identified that GPT-based detection tools misclassified over half of the samples from NNES, with an average false positive rate of 61.3%. However, research produced by GPTZero challenges Liang’s findings and demonstrates that GPTZero can accurately determine the human written status of text when produced by an NNES (Tian,
2023
). This claim is repeated in research produced by Turnitin who also shows no differences in how NNES writing is classified (Adamson,
2023
). However, on a broader scale, questions remain, especially as OpenAI’s AI classifier, although trained on varied human textual patterns, did not include training on NNES-generated text (Elkhatat et al.,
2023
; OpenAI,
2023
). Owing to the inability of this classifier to accurately detect the output of GenAI tools, OpenAI withdrew this tool from use in July 2023 (OpenAI,
2023
). Research by Originality.AI (
2023
) acknowledges that all AI text detectors have their limitations. These include lagging behind in training against recent GenAI tools, which have reached a level of complexity in producing content, making it very difficult to distinguish between AI and human-generated content, and they are susceptible to being bypassed by using adversarial techniques. These problems underscore the need for educational institutions to balance the use of AI detection tools with accommodating AI-produced materials (Perkins et al.,
2023
).
Adversarial techniques as a method of evading GenAI text detection
A few previous studies have investigated how the accuracy of AI text detectors can decrease following manipulation of the textual output of GenAI tools. Mitchell et al. (
2023
) identified that DetectGPT correctly detected 70.3% of model-generated sequences from GPT2-XL. However, after altering the content using an Automated Paraphrasing tool (APT), the detection rate decreased to 4.6%. Similar results of major drops in accuracy rates following the application of APTs and translation tools were identified by Weber-Wulff et al. (
2023
).
A key technique for reducing detection accuracy involves the deliberate incorporation of errors in AI-generated text (Perkins et al.,
2023
). This technique exploits the natural occurrence of minor mistakes in human writing, such as typographical errors, grammatical inconsistencies, and stylistic irregularities. By mimicking these imperfections, AI-generated content can effectively mislead detectors into classifying them as human-authored content. Another approach, as discussed by Liang et al. (
2023
), involves tailoring the complexity of a text to mirror the style typically found in human-produced academic works. This method focuses on adjusting language use and vocabulary to align closely with human writing styles. Thus, AI-generated content can blend more seamlessly with human-authored texts, thereby evading detection more effectively.
The role of prompting GenAI models (‘prompt engineering’) has also been emphasised as important when evading the detection of machine-generated text. As observed in studies by Elkhatat et al. (
2023
), carefully crafted prompts can guide GenAI tools in generating text that not only aligns with the desired content but also strategically incorporates elements that challenge the detection capabilities of AI detectors. This involves a nuanced understanding of the capabilities of AI and the limitations of detectors, ensuring that the generated content remains undetectable while retaining its intended meaning and coherence. Other techniques for evading the identification of machine-generated text have also been presented by Solaiman et al. (
2019
), Sadasivan et al. (
2023
), and Ippolito et al. (
2020
). These include “recursive paraphrasing attacks”, which utilise automated, network-based paraphrasing tools to reduce the accuracy of detectors on watermarked texts, and “spoofing attacks” in which an adversarial human deliberately writes a passage falsely detected as AI-generated without having access to the inner workings of the detection methods. Lancaster (
2023
) proposed that watermarking AI-generated text may be a potential solution; however, the attacks discussed above demonstrate that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes are vulnerable to manipulation of this type.
Research gap
Despite the growing interest and concern surrounding the reliability of AI text detectors and the effectiveness of adversarial techniques in deceiving them, there are no comprehensive comparative analyses that systematically evaluate the performance of various AI text detectors against different GenAI tools, nor are there any studies that do this while exploring the potential consequences from an inclusivity and equity perspective. Existing research points to a lack of holistic understanding of the interplay between AI text detectors, GenAI models, and adversarial techniques (Anderson et al.,
2023
; Chaka,
2023b
; Elali & Rachid,
2023
; Elkhatat et al.,
2023
; Liang et al.,
2023
; Orenstrakh et al.,
2023
; Perkins et al.,
2023
; Weber-Wulff et al.,
2023
). This research gap impedes our ability to provide robust evidence-based recommendations for educators regarding the use of AI text detectors. Gaining a more nuanced perspective on how accurate AI text detectors are in real-world settings means that we can highlight their potential benefits, limitations, and biases and therefore support a more inclusive educational environment in this new GenAI-infused era.
To support this goal, this study explores the effectiveness of different adversarial techniques in adjusting the output of GenAI tools to evade detection by AI text detectors. In doing so, we address the need for a standardised framework and taxonomy to compare and evaluate the performance of AI text detectors against GenAI tools and adversarial techniques (Abd-Elaal et al.,
2022
). With a growing number of GenAI tools available, each having unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses, students attempting to evade detection may employ various techniques to manipulate AI-generated text, making it less likely to be identified by text detectors. Understanding these manipulation techniques can help demonstrate the true effectiveness of AI text detectors in more realistic settings, where students actively try to avoid detection. This knowledge can inform recommendations for higher education institutions and academics regarding whether and how to effectively use these tools to support academic integrity. In addition, these insights can guide software developers in creating more robust detection methods to counter evasion techniques and further enhance the reliability of AI text detectors.
Methodology
Overview
This study employs an experimental design in which we use three popular GenAI tools to generate short samples of text (n = 15). Altered versions of the original samples are created by applying six adversarial techniques (n = 89). Ten human-written samples are used as controls. All the developed samples (n = 114) are tested against seven popular AI text detectors to determine the effect of adversarial techniques on the accuracy of AI text detectors (n = 805). Sample creation and testing were conducted in September and October 2023.
All prompts used to generate the samples, as well as the samples themselves, are publicly available at Mendeley Data. (Perkins, Roe, et al.,
2024a
).
Sample generation
GenAI sample generation
First, we generated an initial set of 15 text samples using three GenAI tools (GPT4, Claude 2, and Bard), with five samples created using each tool. All samples were created using the same five prompts designed to emulate a range of tasks in which GenAI tools may be used. These prompts requested the development of the following outputs.
Mini (short form) university essay testing AI’s ability to construct coherent, argumentative, or exploratory work within an HE setting.
Professional blog post to assess whether GenAI-generated content can demonstrate professionalism, industry knowledge, and expertise while maintaining reader engagement.
Cover letter to apply for an internship designed to test GenAI’s ability to design tailored content specific to a position and the suitability and motivation of the applicant.
Middle-school level comparative analysis task designed to test GenAI’s use of language specific to that of a younger author requiring clarity and simplicity.
Magazine article intended to test for content and tone in a journalistic manner that may appeal to a broad audience.
The prompts were designed to create outputs which covered a range of different topics, linguistic styles, and complexity levels to provide insights into the versatility and consistency of AI detectors in producing results across different forms of text.
Ten control samples were created by the human authors (researchers in this project). The human authors are all proficient English speakers, comprising academic staff who described English as their primary language, and Vietnamese undergraduate NNES students who study at a UK-oriented international university in English.
Adversarial sample generation
All original 15 AI-generated samples were modified using six different adversarial techniques. Except for a separate APT tool to paraphrase the outputs, all adversarial techniques were applied using the same FM with which the samples were originally generated. This maintains the likely process of a user interacting with their chosen FM. This was performed by copying the sample to a new chat window in each tool and then using prompting strategies to request the text to be adjusted according to the requirements of each adversarial technique.
All adversarial techniques were applied following a standardised protocol. The testers were given a standard prompt format for application to each of the 15 samples. These prompts include specific techniques designed to improve the performance of GenAI tools. Examples include the use of delimiters (Sweenor & Ramanathan,
2023
) and prompt chaining (T. Wu et al.,
2022
). Delimiters (in this case, hash marks and titles) were used to identify to ChatGPT where instructions ended, and the content for adjustment began. If a suitable output was not obtained on the first attempt, prompt chaining was used to request specific adjustments to meet the required output. Researchers were restricted to making up to five requests for new prompts to obtain suitable outputs. If a suitable output could not be created within these five iterations, the sample was not considered for testing. Any potential ambiguities in prompts were addressed by requesting the GenAI tool to ask any required questions before providing output. At no point were the text samples manually edited: all adjustments to the original samples were carried out using the relevant GenAI tool.
The format used for each adversarial technique is presented in Table

.

Suitable outputs could not be obtained in one case, resulting in 89 samples of AI-generated text in which adversarial techniques had been applied. When creating the samples for testing, we considered using few-shot prompting techniques (in which samples are shown to the AI model, and then it is asked to imitate the process) to guide the AI models in generating more human-like text. However, we ultimately chose not to employ this method to minimise the influence of external text on the final output. By allowing the AI tools to apply adversarial techniques based on their own underlying datasets and processes, we aimed to demonstrate how each tool would uniquely interpret and execute these techniques, thereby providing a more authentic representation of their capabilities.

Summary of sample generation
Owing to limitations inherent in some of the AI text detectors used, the length of the samples requested in all cases was restricted to approximately 500 words. This resulted in the final length of the samples for testing falling between 350 and 625 words.

Protocol
Testing protocol
Al samples created were tested against seven AI text detectors which had been previously identified in literature (Chaka,
2023a
; Gao et al.,
2022
; Krishna et al.,
2023
; Orenstrakh et al.,
2023
; Perkins et al.,
2023
; Weber-Wulff et al.,
2023
) as being somewhat effective at successfully identifying GenAI content. The detectors were chosen based on a review of existing studies (Chaka,
2023a
; Gao et al.,
2022
; Krishna et al.,
2023
; Orenstrakh et al.,
2023
; Perkins,
2023
; Weber-Wulff et al.,
2023
) as follows:
Turnitin AI detector (Turnitin.com,
2023
)
GPTZero (Tian & Cui,
2023
)
ZeroGPT (ZeroGPT.com, n.d.)
Copyleaks (Copyleaks.com, n.d.)
Crossplag (Crossplag.com, n.d.)
GPT-2 Output Detector (OpenAI, n.d.)
GPTKit (GPTKit.com, n.d.)
To test the samples, the text was either copied and pasted onto online software tools or uploaded where this option was available. The tools used free versions of the software, where possible. However, Turnitin’s AI detection software was used as part of the license held by the lead author’s institution, and both GPTKit and Copyleaks required credits to be purchased to run the required number of samples. All 114 samples were tested using each of the six detection tools, resulting in a total number of 805 tests. Eight samples could not be tested using some of the tools, resulting in a total of 797 valid tests. The reasons for these failures were not explicitly provided by the software due to their proprietary nature. However, based on our observations, we speculate that these issues may have been caused by various factors including text length limitations, formatting incompatibilities or temporary server issues. These occasional failures in processing samples are a limitation of using such tool and highlight the potential challenges educators might face when implementing these detectors in real-world scenarios. The unpredictability in tool performance further underscores the need for caution when considering their use in academic integrity processes.
The results provided by the AI detection tools were recorded and interpreted based on a modified version of the protocol designed by Weber-Wulff et al. (
2023
) for comparison with the existing literature. All test results were classified on a scale as either Positive (P) or Negative (N) based on the accuracy of the tool in determining whether the output was written by a human or generated by a GenAI tool. The classification is presented in Table
4
.

Interpretation protocol
As the AI text detectors all display their results differently, with some providing quantitative statements (“X% probability for AI”) and some qualitative statements (“most likely human written”), we needed a way to standardise the output to allow for comparability. Therefore, we recorded the results based on the interpretation protocols shown in Table
5
.

Accuracy and error analysis
After classifying the outcomes of the tools as (partially) true/false positives/negatives, we assessed the accuracy of the tools using three separate methods, as identified by Weber-Wulff et al. (
2023
). These included a binary classification in which the accuracy was calculated as the ratio of correctly identified cases to all cases, a semi-binary approach which allowed for the results of partially correct results to be awarded half scores, and a logarithmic approach in which scores increased as accuracy rates increased. We also report the mean values of the combined methods.
The calculations used for each test are presented in Table
6
.

In addition, error analysis was conducted to assess false accusations and undetected cases, which are particularly relevant in ensuring an inclusive and non-discriminatory environment. Instances of AI detectors falsely accusing students of academic misconduct are not uncommon and cause concern regarding inclusivity, fairness, and ethical practice in education. Therefore, it is important to establish a threshold at which the AI-generated content detected by these tools is sufficient to level an accusation or to take disciplinary actions. For this calculation, we used a threshold value of 60% to represent a value higher than chance, and to recognise the low likelihood of a partially negative or unclear value resulting in a false accusation of a student (FAS):
$$FAS \, = \, \left( {FP \, + \, PFP} \right) \, / \, \left( {TN \, + \, PTN \, + \, TP \, + \, PTP \, + \, FN \, + \, PFN \, + \, FP \, + \, PFP \, + \, UNC} \right)$$
Another type of error, which is the potential for AI detectors to fail to identify AI-produced texts, can lead to students who use AI for unauthorised content generation being awarded similar credit as honest ones. The likelihood of undetected cases (UDC) is calculated as follows:
$$UDC \, = \, \left( {FN \, + \, PFN} \right) \, / \, \left( {TN \, + \, PTN \, + \, TP \, + \, PTP \, + \, FN \, + \, PFN \, + \, FP \, + \, PFP \, + \, UNC} \right)$$
Results
Baseline testing
The results of our baseline testing of 15 AI-generated samples and 10 human samples are shown in Table

. This test aims to establish the abilities of AI detection tools to determine the authorship criteria of a given sample before any adversarial techniques are applied.

We wish to highlight that these results were accurate at the time of testing, but because of the evolution of both the FMs and AI text detection tools, these comparative results may not necessarily represent the current ability of any of the listed tools. The pace of growth and development in this field means that research must move quickly to keep up with new capabilities, while AI technologies and detection techniques maintain a cat-and-mouse like game of progression and detection. In our study we have attempted to provide sufficient documentary data of the dates, times, and techniques that we have used to answer our research questions, while pointing out that the results may not remain stable for a significant period of time. We encourage other researchers in this field to adopt similar practices of open data sharing, allowing for ongoing verification and extension of findings in this fast-moving area of study.
Testing shows that the AI detectors tested have a mean accuracy rating of only 39.5% when evaluating unmanipulated AI-generated content. Importantly, regarding the human-written control samples, only 67% of the tests were accurate, leading to significant concerns regarding the potential for false accusations from these tools.
Regarding the performance of individual AI detectors, Copyleaks displayed the highest sensitivity, being able to detect 64.8% of AI-generated texts, followed closely by Turnitin at 61%. The worst-performing detector was GPTZero, with a considerably lower accuracy rating of approximately 26%. Before the content was subjected to any manipulation, the GenAI tool that produced the most easily detectable text was Bard, with 76.9% of its outputs correctly identified as AI generated by the detector tools.
Accuracy of GenAI text detectors following the application of adversarial techniques
Next, the performance of the AI detectors was assessed based on their average accuracy rate when detecting manipulated outputs. Table
8
shows the accuracy of the tools when faced with non-manipulated AI content, the accuracy following the application of adversarial techniques, and the percentage drops in accuracy. All reported figures are the mean values.

A comparison of the tools showed reductions in accuracy with variations ranging from 1.5% to more than 42% when the outputs were subjected to adversarial techniques (mean value 17.4%). Copyleaks was the most accurate (58.7%), whereas GPT Kit was the least accurate (4.5%).
Turnitin, one of the most widely used platforms in HEIs, demonstrated the highest drop in accuracy (42.1%) when testing the manipulated output. As a result, despite having the second-highest accuracy in baseline testing, this detector only ranked 5th place out of the seven AI detectors in terms of accuracy following the application of adversarial techniques.
The effectiveness of each technique in reducing the ability of the AI-generated text to be detected is shown in Table
9
, ranked by the overall percentage drop in accuracy after the application of each technique.

Regarding techniques that have a major impact on reducing text detectability, outputs produced with spelling errors (12.9%) or higher burstiness (15.9%) were almost undetectable. However, we recognise that an examination of many of the samples produced using the SE technique resulted in an output that would be very unlikely to be submitted by a student. Although they evaded detection, they would very likely receive poor marks in a real-world setting because of the high number of errors. Increasing the complexity of texts was the least effective adversarial technique, with only a marginal drop of 2% in the detectability rate. Overall, the application of adversarial techniques resulted in a 17.5% drop in accuracy compared to non-manipulated content.
Error analysis
Table

presents an analysis of the errors produced by AI detectors with a focus on false accusations against human-written samples and the proportion of undetected machine-generated samples.
Table 10 FAS and UDC ratios
Full size table
Considerable disparities were observed across detectors in terms of false accusations. However, four of the seven detectors did not misclassify any of the human-written samples. Notably, despite detecting the highest proportion of manipulated text, Copyleaks possessed the highest likelihood of producing false results, with 50% of human-generated samples misidentified as AI-written. Regarding undetected cases, Table
10
also reveals a major risk to academic integrity from the use of adversarial techniques, with six out of seven detectors having a UDC ratio exceeding 50%, and even the highest-performing tool (Copyleaks) failing to identify 39% of AI-generated cases.
Comparative performance of GenAI tools
As discussed earlier, the GenAI tools (Bard, Claude 2, GPT-4) chosen to generate the samples and apply adversarial techniques possess inherent differences in their capabilities, which stem from the different architectures used, and sizes of the training datasets employed. Table
11
highlights some noticeable features regarding the differences between these tools and their potential impact on how well they were able to reduce the detectability of the original samples.
Table 11 Performance of Generative AI tools
Full size table
Overall, we observed that the reduction in detectability was highest when applying adversarial techniques using Bard, with a mean reduction in accuracy of 38.8%. Claude 2 and GPT-4 ranked very closely, at 8% and 7.6%, respectively. However, this must be considered in light of the high accuracy of the AI detectors in correctly identifying the output from Bard in the original AI-generated samples. Therefore, in these cases, adversarial techniques had an oversized impact on reducing the detectability of the Bard output. It is also notable that the three GenAI tools exhibited unique patterns in performance when applying different adversarial attacks. For example, outputs from Bard and Claude 2 showed reductions in detectability when all techniques were applied, whereas applying certain techniques in GPT-4 resulted in an output that was easier to detect. This suggests that the choice of the GenAI tool has an impact on which adversarial techniques might be chosen if reducing the detectability of the text is the goal.
Discussion
Accuracy and vulnerabilities of GenAI text detectors as a barrier to inclusivity
In our baseline testing protocol of both non-manipulated AI-generated samples tested alongside the human-written control samples, we see an initially lower-than-expected average accuracy rating for the detection of AI-generated content, coupled with a substantial rate of false accusations in the human-written control samples. When the AI-generated samples were subjected to manipulation, significant vulnerabilities in accurately detecting text were observed. If the goal of implementing AI detection tools as part of an overall academic integrity strategy is to support academic staff in identifying where machine-generated content has been used and has not been declared, these inaccuracies may lead to a false sense of security and a broader reduction in assessment security. As assessment security is a key component in ensuring inclusive, equitable, and fair opportunities for learners, this is problematic. The varying degrees of reduction in accuracy following the application of adversarial techniques also point to the broader issue of inconsistency and unpredictability in the current AI detection capabilities. The effectiveness of these techniques varies dramatically across detectors, suggesting that the internal algorithms and heuristics of these detectors are tuned differently and react distinctively to similar inputs. Therefore, the results even within an institution may differ depending on the tool being employed and how it is being used.
Effectiveness of adversarial techniques
When exploring individual adversarial techniques, we see that relatively simple manipulations of content (such as the addition of spelling errors and increases in burstiness) are highly effective in evading detection, highlighting the limitations of AI text detectors in distinguishing between human-like irregularities in text production and actual human writing. The least effective technique, ‘increase complexity’, had a minimal impact on detectability, which implies that dense and complex text alone is not a sufficient criterion for AI-generated content to pass undetected.
The results also indicated a significant variance in the detectability of content produced by different GenAI tools, with the output from Bard being easier to detect than Claude 2 and GPT-4. This suggests that not all GenAI outputs are equally recognisable by AI detectors, which has implications for their use in educational settings. The lower detectability of the content generated by Claude 2 and GPT-4 could make them more appealing to those who intend to circumvent academic honesty policies. Claude 2’s superior performance in evading detection across all categories suggests that its outputs might align more closely with the nuanced and variable patterns of human writing or that it may be better at producing more human-like text in its original outputs.
Comparison with prior studies
To contextualise our findings within the existing literature, we compared our results to those of previous studies. In comparison to Weber-Wulff (
2023
) et al.’s testing of detection tools, we noted that AI detectors performed significantly worse in our study, even with unedited text. In their analysis, all detectors achieved accuracy rates of less than 80%, but five scored above 70%. However, in our baseline testing, no detectors achieved such high accuracy. Furthermore, while Weber-Wulff et al. (
2023
) found that Turnitin’s detector was the most accurate, our results placed Turnitin at number two, with Copyleaks showing greater accuracy. The application of machine translation in their study led to a 20% reduction in accuracy, whereas human manual editing reduced accuracy to approximately 50%, and machine translation (paraphrasing) reduced the overall accuracy to 26%. Our results showed similar impacts, with paraphrasing as a technique that reduced accuracy by 21%. In reference to the findings of Elkhatat et al. (
2023
) and Perkins et al (
2023
), we also noted a high degree of variability and low consistency when dealing with GPT-4 content. Our findings also corroborate Chaka’s (
2023a
,
2023b
) and Walters’ (
2023
) research, demonstrating that Copyleaks appears to be the most accurate of the current generation of GenAI text detectors (despite a high FAS rate), with Turnitin also performing relatively well compared to other detectors. These results contribute to the body of knowledge about the variable accuracy of these tools and highlight the potential for inequity in educational assessments across cohorts if detection software is used.
Implications of adversarial techniques for inclusive education in the age of AI
The effectiveness of adversarial techniques in decreasing the likelihood of detecting machine-generated text raises concerns about both academic integrity and inclusivity. The current ability of GenAI tools to generate content that closely resembles human writing poses a significant threat to the fairness and authenticity of academic assessment. If students were to use AI tools to produce their academic work using these adversarial techniques, this would undermine the educational value and compromise the integrity of the assessment process, thereby benefiting some groups of students over others, especially those with access to paid GenAI tools and technical and procedural knowledge. Simultaneously, the fact that detectors may pose additional risks to NNESs that may produce text with less burstiness suggests that the risks of AI detection outweigh the potential benefits by exacerbating the existing inequities in academia. For instance, students with access to advanced AI tools and knowledge of adversarial techniques could gain an unfair advantage over their peers, further widening extant digital inequalities and the digital divide (Lutz,
2019
).
The high level of variability between different detectors suggests that if institutions or academics take an individualistic approach to using these technologies (e.g. different academic staff at the same university using different GenAI detection technologies), the rates of efficacy would vary. Educators therefore need to be cognizant of the fact that while we focus on problematising text-detection software from a perspective of inclusivity, too much focus on GenAI as an emerging risk to academic integrity (Cotton et al.,
2023
; Perkins,
2023
) may lead us to forget that extant threats to inclusivity and educational equity, such as contract cheating or ‘traditional’ plagiarism, have not disappeared.
Error analysis provided insights into the risk of undetected cases and false accusations. With the rate of false accusations at 15%, considering the major impact that this could have on student outcomes, we consider this to be a major concern for student equity. Although some detectors did not have any false accusations, this appeared to come at the cost of a higher UDC ratio, indicating that many instances of AI-generated content could go unnoticed, potentially providing an unfair advantage to dishonest students who can apply these adversarial techniques in a matter of seconds to hide the true source of text.
The use of GenAI text detectors in education
While GenAI tools have great promise in enhancing academic practices for both students and teachers alike, and most publishing houses now permit the transparent use of such tools (Perkins & Roe,
2024a
; STM,
2023
), there are circumstances in which the detection of GenAI texts remains necessary, such as in assessment practices which do not allow for the additional use of these tools or in computer-aided examinations. However, the fact that AI detection tools can be easily manipulated or bypassed using relatively simple adversarial techniques calls into question their viability as tools for maintaining assessment security.
Overall, our results demonstrate the challenges of current AI text detection tools being able to accurately determine whether a given piece of text was created by a human or a GenAI tool. This ability is further reduced when adversarial techniques are used to obscure the nature of a sample. If the goal of any given HEI was to use AI text detectors solely to determine whether a student has breached academic integrity guidelines, we would caution that the accuracy levels we have identified, coupled with the risks inherent in false accusations, means that we cannot recommend them for this purpose. This is not because of the demonstrated abilities of any one tool tested, as we recognise that developers are continuously updating these tools, and the detection of AI-generated content when subject to adversarial techniques is likely to improve. However, simultaneously, advances are being made in the development of more capable FMs that can produce more human-like content, resulting in a constant arms race between FMs and AI text detectors, with student inclusivity paying the price.
We believe that there will be a continued adjustment to GenAI-related learning and assessment practices within HE, with a move towards more acceptance of GenAI-enabled writing. Despite their shortcomings, AI text detectors may be part of a broader process of enabling discussions with students regarding the effective use of GenAI tools in academic writing. Students need experience and practice in learning how to work with GenAI tools, whether they are text-based or multimodal in nature. Being able to demonstrate to students how GenAI text may be integrated with their own writing is a task that these software tools may help with; however, this would only be possible if a non-punitive approach was taken to help students understand how GenAI tools can be used to support their own learning experiences.
GenAI and the future of inclusive education
Committing to inclusive methods of teaching, learning, and assessment demands a proactive and critical approach to integrating emerging AI technologies. Educators must continuously evaluate and adapt their practices to ensure that the adoption of new digital tools enhances rather than compromises inclusivity. This process requires ongoing scrutiny of how AI-related technologies impact diverse learners and a willingness to reimagine traditional educational paradigms in the face of rapid technological change. Similar to blended learning and communities of enquiry that contribute to the reorientation of the traditional classroom structure (Hilliard & Stewart,
2019
), the presence of multiple forms of media on the Internet prompts us to reconsider the reliability and usefulness of source materials in the practice of academic argumentation (Radia & Stapleton,
2009
). GenAI tools offer an opportunity to reconsider the traditional notions of misconduct and the potential barriers and inequities that a punitive approach to detection can face, particularly when relying on novel technologies.
New forms of academic fraud, such as online diploma mills, are growing (Roe & Perkins,
2023
), and complex cases of fraud, such as contract cheating, continue to create unequal opportunities and outcomes (Curtis & Clare,
2024
; Daly & Ryan,
2024
); thus, efforts to promote inclusive forms of participation in higher education cannot solely focus on GenAI, as traditional, long-standing issues in equality of assessment have not gone anywhere, and some are even increasing.
Therefore, we need to foster alternative approaches to educational assessment which recognise the growing ubiquity of GenAI and account for obstacles to inclusive assessment designs. This requires fundamentally rethinking how we assess student learning, moving away from the traditional assessment methods that are easily compromised by AI tools. We would recommend that educators consider how GenAI tools can be more deeply integrated into learning and assessment so that students gain a deeper understanding of the practical and ethical applications of these technologies prior to moving into the workforce. Strategies such as the AI Assessment Scale (Furze et al.,
2024
; Perkins et al.,
2024a
; Roe et al.,
2024
), where the expected use of AI in any given assessment is clearly stated, could help guide educators in adapting assessment practices to align with the AI era, potentially leading to increased student outcomes and pedagogical redesign.
In this study, we sought to answer four fundamental questions. Namely, how reliable AI text detection technologies are, whether adversarial techniques reduce the accuracy detectors, which detectors are most and least effective, and whether any of these technologies demonstrate sufficient accuracy to warrant their deployment in education. Our findings demonstrate that AI text detection technologies are not highly reliable and are vulnerable to multiple adversarial techniques. Furthermore, we found that while some detectors are more accurate than others by orders of magnitude, none reach a level of accuracy above 73.9% for unedited output. In answering our final question, our findings do not support an overall benefit to users of AI text detection technologies considering the potential risks of false positives and their potential to disadvantage certain student groups.
Conclusion
The results of this study revealed that the average accuracy of AI text detectors in identifying non-manipulated AI-generated content was 39.5%, with a 67% accuracy rate for human-written control samples. When adversarial techniques were applied to the AI-generated samples, the average accuracy of the detectors dropped further to 22.14%, with some techniques, such as adding spelling errors and increasing burstiness, proving highly effective in evading detection. Error analysis also highlighted the risk of false accusations and undetected cases. These findings underscore the limitations of current AI text-detection tools in accurately determining the authorship of a given piece of text, particularly when faced with deliberate attempts to obscure the nature of the sample.
This study has several methodological limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings and assessing their generalisability, which stem from both the choices made in the experimental design and the rapidly evolving nature of the AI landscape investigated. First, the scope of our research was restricted to a relatively small number of samples, three GenAI tools, and seven AI detectors which do not encompass the entire spectrum of possible writing styles, types of manipulation, or available tools to generate and detect samples. The pace at which both GenAI tools and AI text detectors are developed, and existing ones are updated means that our results are valid only for a specific snapshot in time. Therefore, the findings here should be viewed as indicative rather than exhaustive, and subsequent research would benefit from a broader evaluation of the currently available detection software, as well as considering how some of the newest FMs, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, ChatGPT-4o, and Gemini Pro 1.5, perform on these types of writing tasks.
Second, our experimental design did not mirror the iterative process that is likely to occur during the use of GenAI-supported academic writing and editing, particularly if there is a deliberate attempt to evade detection. In practice, students are likely to apply several of the techniques we have discussed and engage in continuous software-aided and manual refinement and adjustments, meaning that the ability of AI text-detection tools to detect this type of hybrid text would likely be even lower than demonstrated in the study. Future methodological designs should attempt to replicate the iterative nature of writing to provide more accurate assessments of AI detectors in academia as opposed to experimental settings.
Finally, some of the samples generated after applying adversarial techniques for testing may not accurately represent the quality of work that students would submit in a real-world setting. Although these samples evaded detection by software tools, they are likely to evoke suspicion from human markers because of their poor quality, strange phrasing choices, and excessive errors. This was particularly the case for some of the samples generated by either Claude 2 or Bard when asked to add spelling errors. Again, a broader sample of real-life cases would help explore this in more detail.
Overall, these findings demonstrate that the use of GenAI text-detection software has important ramifications for inclusivity, equality, and integrity in the AI era. Such tools are based on the assumption of assuring assessment fairness, which is a key principle in inclusive assessment design (Morris et al.,
2019
). However, our results showed that detectors are highly sensitive to the application of adversarial techniques, which may represent a more pragmatic view of how GenAI tools are used in academic writing. The implications of this are that, first, those with technological sensibility and resources, as well as inclination, will be able to disguise GenAI content relatively easily for the purpose of misrepresenting authorship. This reduces the equality of assessment (or publication of research) and thus, advantages some groups over others, acting as a barrier to inclusion. Furthermore, the potential for such tools to unfairly penalise students who write at a lower level of perplexity (i.e. a less complex textual structure) (including NNESs or lower-proficiency English speakers) suggests that, at the present time, the use of GenAI detection software for the identification of academic misconduct may produce barriers to inclusive assessment, rather than reduce them.
The major implication of these findings for educators and administrators is that the use of AI text detectors should not be implemented uncritically; users must consider the impacts and limitations of AI text detection technologies before using them for assessment or educational practices. Secondly, the results of such technologies should not be used for punitive actions or in accusations against students without a high degree of certainty, and those in the position to evaluate the results from such technologies need to consider the ease with which detectors can be evaded, and their potential to inequitably impact certain student populations. Finally, the findings imply that educators must radically reconsider their assessment structures and practices in light of new technology, given that current efforts to detect GenAI content are unlikely to be successful.

Abstract
While test anxiety is a problem in asynchronous online courses, few studies have systematically investigated learning factors influencing test anxiety in asynchronous online courses. Additionally, emotional engagement has been identified as a mediator between learning factors and test anxiety. Therefore, this study clarified the mediating role of emotional engagement between learning factors (i.e., self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived ease-of-use, and perceived usefulness) and test anxiety in college-level asynchronous online courses. Overall, 316 college students participated in this study. Structural equation modeling analysis examined the relationships between learning factors and test anxiety. Self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, and perceived ease of use had direct and significant negative influences on test anxiety. Self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction and perceived usefulness had indirect negative effects on test anxiety mediated by emotional engagement. The current findings indicated that instructors should consider self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness when designing and conducting asynchronous online courses to reduce college students’ test anxiety.
Introduction
Background
Asynchronous online courses (AOCs) have received increasing attention in higher education (Kim et al.,
2018
; Lu et al.,
2023
) and are courses that provide asynchronous online learning, a mode of learning that allows for time-independent communication and reflection (Hrastinski,
2008
; Kim et al.,
2018
). AOCs have several advantages, including overcoming time and space limitations (Han et al.,
2023
; Lu et al.,
2023
). Moreover, learning materials in AOCs can be studied multiple times or skipped without instructor supervision (Tseng et al.,
2023
), providing personalized choices for learners at different learning paces. Thus, AOCs offer convenience and numerous benefits to contemporary college students through different learning platforms, such as massive open online courses and small private online courses (Chiu & Hew,
2018
; Ruiz-Palmero et al.,
2020
).
Test anxiety is a common psychological condition that can have serious negative effects on college students’ educational process and can present in the online learning context (Chapell et al.,
2005
; Hill & Wigfield,
1984
; Alibak et al.,
2019
), leading to students’ heavy cognitive load, low achievement and low continuous learning intention in the asynchronous online learning context (Hart,
2012
; Jo et al.,
2015
; Kim et al.,
2021
; Moody,
2004
). Previous studies have found that test anxiety negatively influences students’ academic performance (Cassady & Johnson,
2002
) and physical and psychological development (Fischer et al.,
2016
). Additionally, it can contribute to depression and lead to suicidal behaviors (Lee et al.,
2006
). Thus, exploring the factors and mechanisms that influence test anxiety among college students is necessary. However, few studies have systematically investigated the factors influencing test anxiety in AOCs (Alibak et al.,
2019
). Without understanding the potential influencing factors, clarifying students’ rationale behind test anxiety in online courses is difficult, making it challenging to alleviate inefficiency, underachievement, and low performance in AOCs (Rana & Mahmood,
2010
). Therefore, this study aimed to determine the factors influencing test anxiety in AOCs among college students. In the present study, we mainly examined the factors influencing the learning process, that is, the learning factors in asynchronous online learning (Lu et al.,
2021b
).
Due to their self-paced learning environments, AOCs pose higher requirements for students’ learning autonomy (Kim et al.,
2018
). Learning autonomy is strongly related to self-efficacy (Csizér et al.,
2021
), as strong self-efficacy can promote increased learning confidence. Moreover, in asynchronous online courses where students learn independently, they may encounter feelings of loneliness or isolation (Reedy,
2019
), while interaction is a proposed way to combat students’ feeling of loneliness from their peers and instructors (Kaufmann & Vallade,
2022
). In addition, interaction with peers and teachers could alleviate students’ learning anxiety in an English language classroom (Fang & Tang,
2021
). Thus, increased attention should be given to students’ self-efficacy and interactions with instructors and classmates in AOCs.
In addition, the learning platform is an essential aspect of AOCs, and its ease of use and usefulness could affect students’ ongoing learning intention and emotions while learning (Daneji et al.,
2019
). It has been validated by previous studies that the positive influence of expectation confirmation on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in various contexts, including asynchronous online courses and other technology-enhanced learning contexts (Al-Sharafi et al.,
2023
; Liesa-Orús et al.,
2023
; Lu et al.,
2023
). Still, while technology-enhanced contexts provide various conveniences for students to learn asynchronously, their complex operational nature may increase their pressure and anxiety to perform well on use of asynchronous online learning platforms (Hauser et al.,
2012
; Martin et al.,
2008
). If test anxiety is not well mediated, it will lead to adverse psychological reactions and even affect students’ academic performance (Fischer et al.,
2016
). However, there is still limited research examining how the ease of technology use and its perceived usefulness influence test anxiety in AOCs.
As one of the important subdimension of learning engagement (Sun & Rueda,
2012
), emotional engagement plays a critical role in learning online courses (Daniels et al.,
2016
; Hewson,
2018
), as it correlates with the quality of students’ learning motivation and learning performance in online learning (Özhan & Kocadere,
2020
; Wang et al.,
2022
). Previous studies found that students who engaged more emotions in the learning process displayed a higher level of success and a lower prevalence of dropping out (Özhan & Kocadere,
2020
). At present, it was found that anxiety levels among university students are extremely severe (Al Battashi et al.,
2021
; Husky et al.,
2020
), while student who is emotionally engaged is better able to focus on a task, and is better able to solve complex problems, which could significantly reduce anxiety (Schöbel et al.,
2023
). Thus, it is essential to pay attention to students’ emotional engagement in AOCs.
Previous studies found that emotional engagement was influenced by students’ learning factors, including self-efficacy, interaction, and perceived usefulness (Chen,
2017
; Pellas,
2014
). For example, Pellas (
2014
) found that computer self-efficacy was positively associated with students’ emotional engagement factors in online courses. Moreover, it was found that adolescents’ emotional engagement, such as empathetic joy was negatively related to their anxiety (Smith,
2015
). From this point of view, emotional engagement could be influenced by learning factors, and at the same time, it acts on anxiety. Based on the above analyses, it is reasonable to infer that emotional engagement may mediate the association between learning factors and test anxiety. Previous relevant studies were mainly concentrated on synchronous online learning contexts (Li et al.,
2024
), rarely based on asynchronous online learning contexts. However, asynchronous online learning is different from synchronous online learning contexts, which needs stronger learning autonomy and self-regulation abilities (Kim et al.,
2018
; Lai et al.,
2024
), and the mediating role of emotional engagement between college students’ learning factors and test anxiety in asynchronous online learning still needs to be investigated. Therefore, this study also aimed to investigate the mediating role of emotional engagement in the association between college students’ learning factors and test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context.
Research purpose
Test anxiety is a relatively common negative emotional response and has negative influences on learning, such as not conductive to flow experience and learning confidence (Watthanapas et al.,
2021
). However, a nuanced investigation of the reasons that explain test anxiety in AOCs is still needed. Without proper adjustment, potentially increasing students’ cognitive loads and learning pressure, test anxiety could affect their learning (Mavilidi et al.,
2014
).
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to propose and build an integrated model that examines (1) the relationship between college students’ learning factors and their test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context and (2) the mediating role of emotional engagement in the relationship between college students’ learning factors and their test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context. We also explored the reasons for the existence of these relationships.
Theoretical framework and hypotheses development
Theoretical framework
In this study, social cognitive theory was used as the theoretical framework (Bandura,
1986
), which posits that the regeneration of human function and behavior is dynamically influenced by interconnected and sometimes overlapping personal, behavioral, and environmental determinants (Bandura,
1986
). Social cognitive theory is a comprehensive theoretical framework that has been widely used in many empirical studies (Cai & Shi,
2022
; Lu et al.,
2023
). For example, Lu et al. (
2023
) proposed a research model based on social cognitive theory to investigate the mediating effect of deep approaches to using technologies on learning factors (e.g., intrinsic motivation, peer interaction, and connectedness) and higher-order thinking skills in a technology-enhanced open inquiry-based learning context.
For the critical characteristics of asynchronous online courses, we proposed a personal belief model which consisted of five key independent variables: self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Since the progress of asynchronous online courses is mainly controlled by students themselves, their learning autonomy is important, and learning autonomy is affected by self-efficacy (Csizér et al.,
2021
; Kim et al.,
2018
), so self-efficacy was taken into account. Moreover, students who learn independently in asynchronous online courses are more likely to feel lonely (Reedy,
2019
), while interaction is a suggested way to combat the lonely feeling from their peers and instructors (Kaufmann & Vallade,
2022
), thus, interaction was considered. What is more, the learning platform is an essential aspect of AOCs, its ease of use and usefulness could affect students’ ongoing learning intention and emotions (Daneji et al.,
2019
), thus, perceived ease of use and usefulness was incorporated into the investigation.
Among the social cognitive theory framework, the determining factors of the personal dimension are individuals’ beliefs about their abilities and skills. The determining factors of the behavioral dimension are individuals’ behavior while demonstrating their abilities and skills. The determining factors of the environment refer to the influence of the surrounding conditions on individuals’ abilities, skills, and beliefs. Self-efficacy refers to “the perception and belief that an individual has of their skills and that they can mobilize effectively to succeed in a particular action” (Puozzo & Audrin,
2021
, p. 1), so we identified it as the personal dimension. Interaction refers to the two-way reciprocal communication among learners and instructors (Moore & Kearsley,
1996
), while communication is one of the learning behaviors, so we identified interaction in AOCs as the behavioral dimension. Perceived ease of use refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system is free of effort” (Davis,
1989
, p. 320). Perceived usefulness is “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system will enhance his or her job performance” (Davis,
1989
, p. 320). Both of them two are students’ perceptions of learning platform (the online learning environment), so we identified students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in AOCs as the environmental dimension.
As seen in Fig.
1
, we proposed a research framework in this study. It includes (1) independent variables (including self-efficacy, interaction, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness), (2) mediating variable (emotional engagement), and (3) dependent variable (test anxiety).

Based on this research framework, several hypotheses emerged. The following sections discuss these hypotheses according to the relationship among these key variables.
The relationship between learning factors and test anxiety
Test anxiety
is a multidimensional structure and has been defined as “a set of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral responses related to concerns about possible failure or poor performance on an exam or a similar evaluative situation” (Bodas et al.,
2008
, p. 387) that invoke “an unpleasant feeling or emotional state that has physiological and behavioral concomitants” (Dusek,
1980
, p. 88). Test anxiety exists in numerous learning contexts, including asynchronous online learning (Alhazbi & Hasan,
2021
; Sullivan,
2016
). Research has indicated that test anxiety has a negative influence on students’ academic performance and physical and psychological development (Cassady & Johnson,
2002
; Fischer et al.,
2016
). Thus, identifying the mechanisms of action in test anxiety is necessary to help reduce college students’ test anxiety in the asynchronous online learning context.
Self-efficacy and test anxiety
Self-efficacy
refers to “the perception and belief that an individual has of their skills and that they can mobilize effectively to succeed in a particular action (in the sense of achieving a goal)” (Puozzo & Audrin,
2021
, p. 2). This definition builds on Bandura’s definition of self-efficacy, which has been widely adopted in other studies (Tasgin & Dilek,
2023
). In educational contexts, self-efficacy is individuals’ beliefs that they have the capacity to deal with school-related tasks (Lei et al.,
2021
; Putwain et al.,
2013
). Previous studies found that self-efficacy is significantly related to student learning performance (Bonaccio & Reeve,
2010
; Hayat et al.,
2021
; Onyeizugbo,
2010
).
When it comes to the relationship between self-efficacy and test anxiety, several studies demonstrated that self-efficacy was negatively related to student’ test anxiety (Bonaccio & Reeve,
2010
; Hayat et al.,
2021
). For example, Lei et al. (
2021
) found that academic self-efficacy was negatively correlated with students’ test anxiety, which was supported by Adesola and Li’s (
2018
) findings. Based on this body of research, we proposed the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1
(H1): College students’ self-efficacy would be negatively related to test anxiety in asynchronous online learning contexts.
Interaction and test anxiety
In an asynchronous online learning context, face-to-face communication between classmates and instructors is absent, making online interaction particularly important (Rahman et al.,
2021
). Instructor-learner and learner-learner interactions are vital in AOCs.
Instructor-learner interaction
refers to the two-way communication between the instructor and students in the asynchronous online learning process (Moore & Kearsley,
1996
). Test anxiety of learners usually comes from the learning courses, the teachers or their classmates, so, positive and effective interaction with instructors and learners could significantly reduce test anxiety (Masomi,
2015
).
Learner-learner interaction
is the two-way reciprocal communication among learners, with or without an instructor, in the asynchronous online learning process (Kuo et al.,
2014
).
Regarding the relationship between interaction and test anxiety, Peleg-Popko (
2002
) examined the relationship between family interaction, children’s traits, and test anxiety and found significant negative correlations between family interaction, children’s traits, and test anxiety. Cohen (
1969
) also investigated the effects of group interaction and progressive hierarchy presentation on test anxiety desensitization and reported that students in groups who were given an opportunity to interact reported a greater reduction in test anxiety than those without this opportunity. Cong-Lem and Hang (
2018
) investigated the relationship between high school students’ willingness to communicate and their speaking test anxiety, and found that there was a negative relationship between them. Masomi (
2015
) found that collaborative learning could reduce test anxiety. In AOCs, students and instructors usually interact with each other through communication and collaboration. Given this, we proposed the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2
(H2): College students’ instructor-learner interactions would be negatively related to test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context.
Hypothesis 3
(H3): College students’ learner-learner interactions would be negatively related to test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context.
Perceived ease of use and test anxiety
Davis (
1989
) defined
perceived ease of use
as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system is free of effort” (p. 320). This definition comes from a paper that has been cited more than 80,000 times, with high authority. In AOCs, perceived ease of use is the degree to which students perceive using AOCs as effortless. Since AOCs are based on online platforms, they involve technical operations, including working with the internet and computers during examinations (Alibak et al.,
2019
); therefore, the ease of use of the platform merits further study.
Regarding the relationship between perceived ease of use and test anxiety, Saadé and Kira (
2007
) found a significant negative relationship between anxiety and perceived ease of use. Alkis (2010) found that test anxiety was inversely related to students’ behavioral intentions to use web-based assessments. In other words, if students perceived technology as easy to use, they had a high intention to use it (Mastuti & Seger Handoyo,
2019
), and the more he/she use it, the more familiar he will become with it. At this time, students’ test anxiety could be relieved by familiarity. Based on these studies, we proposed the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4
(H4): College students’ perceived ease of use would be negatively related to test anxiety in asynchronous online learning contexts.
Perceived usefulness and test anxiety
Perceived usefulness
is “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system will enhance his or her job performance” (Davis,
1989
, p. 320). This definition comes from the same paper as the definition of perceived ease of use, which has been cited more than 80,000 times and is highly authoritative. While perceived usefulness in AOCs, refers to the degree to which students believe that AOCs can improve learning performance. Since AOCs represent only one form of online courses, their usefulness is a critical factor to explain learners’ tendency to use this form of learning, therefore, paying attention to the usefulness of AOCs is also important.
Regarding the relationship between perceived usefulness and test anxiety, research has shown that computer anxiety is negatively related to the perceived usefulness of computers (Igbaria & Parasuraman,
1989
; Igbaria et al.,
1994
). Liaw and Huang (
2013
) found that students’ perceived anxiety was negatively related to the perceived usefulness of e-learning, but the relationship did not reach statistical significance. Computer anxiety is the fear of using computers and is an affective response (Chua et al.,
1999
). From an information-processing perspective, negative emotions related to high anxiety divert cognitive resources from task execution (Kanfer & Heggestad,
1999
). Thus, we proposed the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5
(H5): College students’ perceived usefulness would be negatively related to test anxiety in asynchronous online learning contexts.
Mediating effects of emotional engagement between learning factors and test anxiety
Emotional engagement
refers to learners’ positive and negative emotions toward their instructors, peers, and learning activities (Christenson et al.,
2012
). Positive emotions include interest, enthusiasm, and enjoyment during learning (Renninger & Bachrach,
2015
), whereas negative emotions include sadness, boredom, and frustration during learning (Skinner,
2016
). Emotional engagement is vital for changing learners’ behaviors (Bandura,
2012
). In the present study, we mainly focus on students’ positive emotions, including their high levels of interest and positive attitudes, which could enroll students’ interest, identification, and positive attitudes or values about the learning process (Pellas,
2014
). Previous studies have found that emotional engagement is correlated with test anxiety, especially among high school and secondary school students (Raufelder et al.,
2015
). However, these studies mainly looked at other self-cognition related learning factors, including computer self-efficacy, self-regulation and self-esteem in the computer cram schools learning environment and online learning programs (Chen,
2017
; Pellas,
2014
).
Regarding the relationship between self-efficacy and emotional engagement, Pellas (
2014
) found that computer self-efficacy was positively associated with students’ emotional and cognitive engagement factors in online courses. In addition, Chen (
2017
) reported that learning engagement fully mediated the relationship between computer self-efficacy and learning performance and that computer self-efficacy was positively correlated with learning engagement among students who were in their late middle and older years.
Regarding the relationship between teacher-student, student-student interactions and emotional engagement, Miao et al. (
2022
) reported that teacher-student and student-student interactions could directly influence learning engagement in online environments. Wang et al. (
2022
) reported that learner-learner interactions could directly and positively predict learning engagement during online learning, whereas instructor-learner interactions could affect learning engagement through learner-learner interactions. Qureshi et al. (
2023
) also found that peer interaction with peers and student-instructor interaction positively influenced students’ engagement through the mediating role of active collaborative learning in the online collaborative learning context.
Regarding the relationship between perceived ease of use and emotional engagement, Kim et al. (
2021
) found that perceived ease of use could indirectly influence learning engagement through perceived usefulness as a mediator in massive open online courses. Iswanto et al. (
2021
) also reported similar findings for employee performance. Moreover, in the asynchronous online learning contexts, when students find an online learning platform easier to use, the higher interest they would use it, which could enhance their emotional engagement.
Regarding the relationship between perceived usefulness and emotional engagement, Kim et al. (
2021
) reported that perceived usefulness has a direct effect on student engagement in massive open online courses. Similarly, Jung and Lee (
2018
) found that college students’ perceived usefulness had a significant direct effect on their learning engagement in massive open online courses. Gunness et al. (
2023
) also found this relationship in a semi-synchronous online learning context. In the asynchronous online learning contexts, when students feel AOCs more useful, they will have more interest to learn it, which could improve their emotional engagement. Based on these studies, we proposed the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 6
(H6): College students’ self-efficacy would be positively related to emotional engagement in asynchronous online learning contexts.
Hypothesis 7
(H7): College students’ instructor-learner interaction would be positively related to emotional engagement in an asynchronous online learning context.
Hypothesis 8
(H8): College students’ learner-learner interactions would be positively related to emotional engagement in an asynchronous online learning context.
Hypothesis 9
(H9): College students’ perceived ease of use would be positively related to their emotional engagement in an asynchronous online learning context.
Hypothesis 10
(H10): College students’ perceived usefulness would be positively related to their emotional engagement in an asynchronous online learning context.
Regarding the relationship between emotional engagement and test anxiety, it was found that adolescents’ emotional engagement, such as empathetic joy was negatively related to their anxiety (Smith,
2015
). In addition, students’ agentic engagement was negatively related to test anxiety, with basic psychological needs acting as a mediator (Mehdipour Maralani et al.,
2018
). Based on this research, we proposed the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 11
(H11): College students’ emotional engagement would be negatively related to test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context.
Given the existing body of research on the relationship between our variables of interest (i.e., learning actors, emotional engagement, test anxiety), a research model was proposed for the present study to explain their relationship in an asynchronous online learning context (Fig.
2
).

Methods
Research design
This study adopted a quantitative method research design to investigate college students’ self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, emotional engagement, and test anxiety and examine the relationship between these key variables in the asynchronous online learning context. Quantitative research methods are systematic investigative processes primarily involving the collection and analysis of numerical data to understand phenomena, establish patterns, test hypotheses, and make predictions. Survey research was used in the present study (Creswell & Creswell,
2017
), this method has been used extensively across various disciplines including social sciences, natural sciences, economics, and health sciences (Lu et al.,
2021b
; Prentice et al.,
2020
).
We collected data through questionnaires and used statistical methods to analyze the relationships between these research variables. The questionnaire was issued during the middle of the spring semester. Both universities involved in this study offered online courses every semester, and all students were enrolled in the fall semester. Therefore, participants in this study had at least one semester of learning experience using the online learning platform.
Research design of this study is illustrated in Fig.
3
, this figure outlines an eight-step process for conducting this study. Each phase ensures that the research is methodical, reliable, and valid, leading to insightful outcomes. First is identifying the research problems, this step involves recognizing and defining the research problems that need to be addressed. Second is constructing the research model, this involves creating a conceptual framework that outlines the key variables and their hypothesized relationships. Third is designing questionnaires, these questionnaires are tools for data collection that will help in measuring the variables specified in the research model. Fourth is collecting data, in this step, the designed questionnaires are distributed to collect data from the relevant population. Once data is collected, the measurement model needs to be confirmed. This involves assessing the goodness-of-fit, construct reliability, validity, and discriminant validity to ensure that the measurement model accurately captures the constructs of interest. And then is analyzing the direct and indirect influence, this analysis helps in understanding the relationships and interactions between different factors. Next is confirming the research model, this involves validating the hypothesized relationships and making any necessary adjustments to the model based on the findings. The last step is discussion and conclusion, this involves interpreting the findings, discussing their implications, and suggesting potential areas for future research. This systematic approach ensures that the research is thorough, valid, and reliable, leading to meaningful and actionable conclusions.

Participants
A total of 316 higher-education students from eastern China, ranging from first-year undergraduate to second-year master’s degrees, who had asynchronous online learning experiences for at least one semester from a range of disciplines, participated in this study. Participants primarily came from two universities, one is a normal university, and the other is a science and engineering university. The gender ratio at each school was approximately 3:7 and 7:3 respectively, with more boys at the science and engineering university and more girls at the normal university. The term
normal university
refers to a teacher-training institution of higher education. Among the 316 participants, 176 came from the normal university, 140 came from the other, 133 (42.1%) majored in liberal arts, 183 (57.9%) majored in science, 133 were men (42.1%), and 183 were women (57.9%). It is crucial to emphasize that the study employed random sampling, ensuring a degree of representativeness in the selected cohort.
During the asynchronous online learning process on the pre-agreed learning platform, the instructor first introduced an overview of the course, its objectives, its outline and its evaluation metrics (including the proportion of their regular grades and final exam grades) to all students. Second, the instructor explained how to use the learning resources based on an online learning platform. Subsequently, the course assessment requirements were introduced. After this introduction, students could learn about the materials at their own pace. Learning materials came in different forms, including video lectures, readings, assignments, quizzes and exams and so on. Students were required to submit homework and complete assignments and tests before the deadline. Generally, updates and important information posted by instructors on the course platform. When students encountered problems in the learning process, they could post them on the discussion board of the platform or send private messages and emails to their classmates or instructors. Their classmates and instructors responded when they logged onto the platform. Finally, when students finished all the learning assignments, the platform graded them according to their academic performance, including the completion of learning assignments, homework, and interactions with classmates and instructors. As seen in Fig.

, this interface showcases a typical asynchronous online course platform, featuring a menu bar positioned on the left-hand side and a content bar on the right. Students can navigate through designated sections to study and complete their learning assignments as per their requirements.

Instruments
The questionnaire comprised two parts. The first part collected the participants’ demographic data. The second part measured the students’ perceptions of self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, emotional engagement and test anxiety.
Self-efficacy
Student self-efficacy was measured using three items adapted from Cheng and Tsai (
2011
). Its overall reliability alpha in previous study was 0.84. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
strongly disagree
) to 5 (
strongly agree
). An example item assessing self-efficacy is “I believe that I can get excellent grades in asynchronous online learning courses.”
Instructor-learner interaction and learner-learner interaction
Students’ instructor-learner and learner-learner interactions were measured using three items adapted from Rahman et al. (
2021
). Their Cronbach’s alpha in previous study were respectively 0.83 and 0.89. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (
strongly disagree
) to 5 (
strongly agree
). A representative item to measure instructor-learner interaction is “I have numerous interactions with the instructor during the asynchronous online learning courses.” An example of the items measuring learner-learner interaction is “I receive lots of feedback from my classmates in asynchronous online learning courses.”
Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness
Students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were measured using three items adapted from MacLeod et al. (
2018
) because this scale was closer to the characteristics of AOCs in the present study. In the preceding study, their Cronbach’s alpha values stood at 0.87 and 0.86, respectively. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
strongly disagree
) to 5 (
strongly agree
). A sample item assessing perceived ease of use is “In asynchronous online learning courses, I can use technology, which is easy to navigate.” An item used to measure perceived usefulness is “Asynchronous online learning courses can benefit my learning experience.”
Emotional engagement
Students’ emotional engagement was measured using five items adapted from Sun and Rueda (
2012
) that were rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
strongly disagree
) to 5 (
strongly agree
). Its Cronbach’s alpha in previous study was 0.88. A representative item measuring emotional engagement is, “I like taking the asynchronous online learning courses.”
Test anxiety
Students’ test anxiety was measured using three items adapted from Pintrich et al. (
1993
) that were rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
strongly disagree
) to 5 (
strongly agree
). Its Cronbach’s alpha in previous study was 0.80. A representative item measuring test anxiety is, “I have an uneasy, upset feeling when I take an exam in asynchronous online learning courses.”
Data collection and analysis
An online survey was administered during the spring semester at the two participating universities to collect data. The universities granted permission to conduct this research before conducting the surveys. Participants were told that their survey results would not influence their academic grades and that their information would only be used for educational research. Participation was both voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire required approximately 8–10 min to complete. All responses were then imported into SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 21.0 for data analysis.
Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the relationships between independent and dependent variables in the present study. First, the overall model fit was evaluated to confirm the measurement model. Second, a structural model was constructed to test hypotheses regarding college students’ learning factors, emotional engagement, and anxiety. Path coefficients, standardized regression weights (β value), and
t
-test values were used to confirm the relationship between college students’ learning factors and their test anxiety.
Results
To investigate the differences between independent variables that investigated in the present study, we used ANOVA to examine the differences in distributions between self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in the individual level, and it was found there was a significant difference between these independent variables (F = 89.11,
p
< .001). Next, to further look into the relationships between independent variables, mediating variable and dependent variables, structural equation modeling was used to assess the study’s proposed research model. The model’s overall fit was evaluated to confirm the measurement model (Ullman & Bentler,
2012
). After the overall model fit was found to be within the acceptable range, a follow-up analysis of each variable in the research model was conducted.
Confirming the measurement model
The measurement model was assessed for goodness-of-fit, construct reliability, and construct validity. Goodness-of-fit was determined based on the GFI, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR. These coefficients were chosen based on their relevance to the specific type of model and the nature of the data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive assessment of how well the model fits the data, taking into account different aspects of model performance such as variance explained, prediction accuracy, and complexity. All model fit indices were within the acceptable ranges (χ
2
/
df
= 2.14 < 3, GFI = 0.905 > 0.90, CFI = 0.951 > 0.90, TLI = 0.939 > 0.90, RMSEA = 0.060 < 0.08, SRMR = 0.039 < 0.08) (Hair et al.,
2010
), indicating that the measurement model exhibited a satisfactory fit (See Table
1
).

The construct reliability of the model was determined through composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach’s alpha (Table
2
). CR is a measure of the internal consistency and reliability of a set of indicators for a latent construct. The CR values in this study were all over 0.70, indicating satisfactory reliability (Nunnally & Bernstein,
1994
). Cronbach’s alpha values were all over 0.70 and within acceptable limits (Fornell & Larcker,
1981
). The convergent validity was determined using the extracted average variance (AVE). AVE reflects the average amount of variance that a construct captures from its indicators relative to the variance due to measurement error. The AVE values here were all greater than 0.5, which were in the satisfactory range (Segars,
1997
).

The means, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis, and correlation analyses are presented in Table
3
. The square roots of the AVE were compared to the correlations between latent variables to evaluate discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker,
1981
), all of which were less than the corresponding AVE square roots, which was satisfactory. Overall, these results indicated that the proposed research model had a good fit.

The structural model and hypothesis test
The structural model was constructed to test the hypotheses. As can be seen in Fig.
5
, the structural model was adjusted based on the research model, presented with the path coefficients marked by standardized regression weights (β value) and
t
-values to show the relationship between college students’ learning factors and their test anxiety in the asynchronous online learning context. In Fig.

The findings indicted that some hypotheses were supported, including H1, H2, H4, H6, H7, H8, H10, and H11 (Table
4
). However, the other hypotheses are not supported, including H3, H5, and H9. Self-efficacy (β = − 0.22,
p
< .01), instructor-learner interaction (β = − 0.25,
p
< .001), perceived ease of use (β = − 0.21,
p
< .01) and emotional engagement (β = − 0.28,
p
< .001) were significantly negatively related to test anxiety. Self-efficacy (β = 0.17,
p
< .05), instructor-learner interaction (β = 0.22,
p
< .01), learner-learner interaction (β = 0.20,
p
< .01) and perceived usefulness (β = 0.33,
p
< .01) were significantly positively associated with emotional engagement.

Analysis of indirect effects between key factors
The direct and indirect effects of each hypothesis were analyzed in the present study to investigate the mediation effects. Based on the above analyses, we performed percentile bootstrapping and bias-corrected bootstrapping at a 95% confidence interval with 2000 bootstrap sample (Arnold et al.,
2015
) to test full or partial mediation. We calculated the confidence intervals of the lower and upper bounds to test the significance of the indirect effects, as recommended by Preacher and Hayes (
2008
). The indirect effects of self-efficacy on test anxiety (β = − 0.05,
p
< .05,
Z
= -0.18), instructor-learner interaction on test anxiety (β = − 0.06,
p
< .05,
Z
= -1.87), learner-learner interaction on test anxiety (β = − 0.06,
p
< .05,
Z
= -2.07) and perceived usefulness on test anxiety (β = − 0.08,
p
< .01,
Z
= -2.38) were all significant (Table
5
). While the indirect effect of perceived ease of use on test anxiety (β = 0.01,
p
= .69,
Z
= -0.35) was not significant.

Discussion and conclusion
This study aimed to provide in-depth insights into the relationship between students’ learning factors, test anxiety, and emotional engagement in asynchronous online learning. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between college students’ learning factors and their test anxiety and the mediating role of emotional engagement in the relationship between them in an asynchronous online learning context.
The relationship between learning factors and test anxiety
First, the relationship between college students’ learning factors and test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context was explored, and we found that students’ self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, and perceived ease of use were significantly and inversely related to test anxiety, suggesting that students may experience less test anxiety when they experience greater self-efficacy, interaction, or perceived ease of use simultaneously. These findings were consistent with previous studies (Čeko & Reić,
2020
; Hayat et al.,
2021
), including research in the online and high school learning contexts. These findings also indicate that instructors should help college students improve their self-efficacy, instructor-learner interactions, and perceived ease of use in an asynchronous online learning context, which could reduce their test anxiety. While students’ learner-learner interaction and perceived usefulness did not significantly influence students’ test anxiety, these findings were not consistent with previous research (Igbaria et al.,
1994
; Lin & Hou,
2022
; Peleg-Popko,
2002
). This can be explained by the fact that in asynchronous online learning contexts, learners typically engage with their classmates via online platforms that do not offer real-time communication. When students seek to communicate with peers due to test difficulty, they may not receive timely responses, leading to test anxiety to some extent. Furthermore, perceived usefulness refers to the degree to which students believe that asynchronous online courses could improve their learning performance. During the test period, learners tended to evaluate whether the course is beneficial, thus, its usefulness may not significantly impact test anxiety at this stage. Instead, perceived ease of use may be crucial, if the asynchronous online platform is difficult to navigate, it can increase the difficulty of online tests, thereby significantly affecting test anxiety.
The mediating role of emotional engagement between learning factors and test anxiety
Second, we examined the mediating role of emotional engagement between college students’ learning factors and test anxiety in an asynchronous online learning context. Students’ self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, and perceived usefulness were significantly and positively associated with emotional engagement, consistent with previous findings (Gunness et al.,
2023
; Miao et al.,
2022
; Pellas,
2014
). Perceived ease of use was the only learning factor that not significantly related to emotional engagement, which was not consistent with previous findings (Iswanto et al.,
2021
). Moreover, emotional engagement was found to be significantly negatively related to test anxiety, which is consistent with previous research (Mehdipour Maralani et al.,
2018
). Therefore, emotional engagement emerged as a significant mediator between self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, perceived usefulness, and test anxiety. However, it did not serve as a significant mediator between perceived ease of use and test anxiety.
The lack of significant relationship between students’ perceived ease of use and emotional engagement may be attributed to the role of ease of use in determining the initial ease of starting to learn in asynchronous online courses. Once students have begun their learning journey, the perceived usefulness becomes the primary factor influencing their emotional engagement with the course. Consequently, students’ perceived ease of use may not directly impact their emotional engagement. This finding indicates that instructors should be aware of students’ self-efficacy, instructor-learner interaction, learner-learner interaction, and perceived usefulness to improve their emotional engagement in asynchronous online courses.
Theoretical and practical value
This study highlights the importance of paying close attention to college students’ test anxiety while learning in asynchronous online courses and has theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, this study highlighted that social cognitive theory could be a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between learning factors and test anxiety in online asynchronous courses. The findings provide a more integrative perspective for reducing college students’ test anxiety in asynchronous online learning courses than previously reported.
From a practical perspective, this study has several implications for reducing college students’ test anxiety in asynchronous online learning courses. First, instructors should design moderately challenging tasks in asynchronous online learning courses to improve college students’ self-efficacy. Instructors can help learners succeed by continually providing them with moderately challenging materials and tasks and increasing the task difficulty to reflect their progress. Consistent success with these materials and tasks creates a record of active mastery or performance that instructors can use to inform struggling learners to increase their opportunities for success. This highly motivating realization could further ensure academic engagement in similar tasks. Overall, success is crucial for enhancing confidence and the willingness to keep trying (Margolis & McCabe,
2006
). Second, some interactive learning tasks should be arranged to improve interactions between instructors and students, such as collaborative inquiry-based learning activities and mutual evaluation activities. Third, improving the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of asynchronous online learning courses depends on both the course designers and platform developers, who must conduct many investigations about students’ learning preferences before redesigning platforms so that the redesigned learning content and platforms can better meet students’ learning needs and habits. Finally, instructors need to communicate more with students to improve students’ emotional engagement since communication conveys support and security, helping students cope with stress, such as test anxiety (Peleg-Popko,
2002
). Students should be encouraged to provide positive feedback to their peers during the learning process so that they can be more actively and enthusiastically to participate in learning activities.
Limitations and future research directions
Although this study provides new insights into students’ test anxiety in AOCs, it had some limitations that should be addressed in further research. First, this study specifically focused on students’ learning factors, some psychological factors, such as tension and excitement in learning asynchronous online courses, were included as variables in future studies. Second, the data used in this study were self-reported, which are subjective. Other objective measures, such as learning behavior observations and analyses, should be considered in future studies to support our current self-reported findings. Third, the number of participants in the present study was limited, and additional participants from other cultures or countries could be included to ensure diversity and increase the generalizability of the findings.

Abstract
This research explores using blogs as an innovative assessment tool to enhance authentic learning and professional skill development in students. Unlike traditional methods, blogs foster active knowledge building and peer interaction, making learning more engaging and aligned with industry contexts. The study involved third-year planning students, in the course
Governance and Planning
, and utilised questionnaires, focus groups, and blog post analyses. Results indicated that blogs promoted reflective practice, facilitated peer review, and improved learning efficiencies. Despite some initial resistance and concerns about academic rigor, students found that blogging enhanced their understanding of course content and professional practices. Teacher support and peer feedback played a crucial role in this process. The literature supports blogs’ effectiveness in motivating students and aligning learning activities with real-world applications. However, assumptions about students’ familiarity with blogging were challenged, highlighting the need for thorough induction and support. Overall, blog-based assessments proved beneficial in creating authentic learning experiences and preparing students for their future careers. Future research should consider long-term studies on graduate outcomes and further explore peer review mechanisms.
Introduction
Blogs have been trialled in this research as a means for introducing situation-based authentic learning and assessment activities that achieve learning outcomes aligned to industry contexts. Blogs are distinctive learning and assessment tools which are unique in that they are more than just technology mediated versions of conventional learning environments (Dourish,
2003
). They foster active, constructive, knowledge building activities that provide a positive and motivating experience and their use leads to greater levels of perceived learning (Garcia et al.,
2019
; Wang & Chiou,
2022
). Blogs enable and facilitate peer interactions (Yousef et al.,
2020
), provide opportunities for communications in a mode aligned to industry conventions, and enable students to produce artefacts using a variety of media formats in order to evidence their learning.
Engaging students in the development and demonstration of skills that equip them to perform successfully in their future work and careers requires rethinking mechanisms to evidence learning. To successfully prepare students for future work-based interactions, learning experiences must address the problems that graduates will encounter in work, the relationships they will need to form, and the situations they will navigate (Le et al.,
2023
).
This paper presents a research project that was undertaken in response to evidence from previous student survey comments that the content for the course was difficult to engage with and lacked a connectedness to industry perspectives. Changes in the course content and teaching staff created an opportunity to re-think the assessment tasks and learning outcomes. A more experiential approach was adopted to connect students with a real-world application of their discipline knowledge. Experiential approaches involve collaboration, reflection, and assessment (Austin & Rust,
2015
) where experiences external to class based activity are integrated with objectives and goals of the discipline to “transform classroom and community learning into a deeper understanding of the world” (Qualters,
2010
). This approach is dependent on students’ learned material from the course, and results in assimilation, ability to develop occupational competence, and accommodation in the transaction with changing industry contexts (Harteis & Billett,
2023
).
The aim of the blog-based assessment was to provide learners with authentic experiences to connect disciplinary understanding with real world contexts (Gamage,
2022
). The blog assessment tasks for the course were structured around personal/individual websites. Each student developed and published a website with blogs that that comprised a diverse folio of written pieces, video posts, photos, essays, and other items aligned with the assessment criteria. The non-teaching co-investigator conducted an induction session for students in blogging software
Blogger version 3
(
https://www.blogger.com/about/?bpli=1
; accessed June 2023) in the first class of the semester. This paper examines whether the alternative blog-based assessment approaches enhanced authentic representations of learning and helped to induct students into disciplinary and professional practices.
Literature review
The introduction of blogs as an alternative learning and assessment approach is supported by diverse research studies that have focused on their role for motivating and engaging students, enhancing learner agency, leveraging social interactions and communications to acquire and apply skills and knowledge, evidencing learning outcomes, as well as aligning to industry practices to create authentic assessment activities (Salam & Farooq,
2020
). This literature review adopts a narrative method to provide a background to the research and technologies used, highlight trends, and identify gaps in the literature. It will frame the research undertaken and provide context for analysing the effectiveness of blogs for improving assessment design that enables a closer alignment with disciplinary and professional learnings.
Engaging with discipline content and assessment is critical for effective learning to occur and motivation has been shown to have a significantly high correlation with academic performance and is influenced by diverse factors (Kickert et al.,
2019
). Agency and self-efficacy are primary motivating factors that support engagement (Martin,
2012
). Students experience high-quality motivation when they perceive themselves as working autonomously, competently, and can relate to the learning activity. These psychological needs are described by self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci,
2000
), which when applied to the classroom, factor in how the teacher motivates students (Jang et al.,
2016
). The teacher's motivating actions contrast approaches that support autonomy and those where the teacher is controlling (Ahmadi et al.,
2023
; Reeve,
2009
). This impacts student motivation and engagement levels by satisfying or frustrating needs.
Engagement theory (Kearsley & Shneiderman,
1998
) describes how students are engaged for effective learning to occur. It includes three parameters: collaboration, project based delivery, and an authentic real world focus. To engage and motivate learners, tasks must provide agency, confer autonomy and be authentic, and represent the same kind of challenges and cognitive structures as the real world (Martin,
2023
). Blogs can promote a process of formative skill development over multiple iterations and shift the fundamental responsibility for learning to the learner, and away from the instructor or the institution (Barber et al.,
2015
). Interestingly, this intrinsic motivation where students are involved in task-based activities and feel they have a high level of control (Lee & Martin,
2017
) has been shown to be less important than extrinsic factors where students were concerned about meeting assessment requirements and teacher expectations. However, fostering a shared ownership of the learning environment by leveraging educational technologies confers agency in students. Strategies to ensure this include strong teacher-student relationships (Heilporn et al.,
2021
; Reeve,
2012
) through regular communications and ensuring that assessment is a focus of the curriculum.
Social technologies such as blogs that disrupt established practice (Flavin,
2012
) can cause an extra burden on students and be destabilising for academics (Bennett et al.,
2017
). The burgeoning availability of educational and social technologies has made choices for teachers wanting to adopt new teaching and assessment approaches increasingly complex, however learners believe educational technologies positively impact their approaches to learning (Liu et al.,
2020
). Yet, student preferences are that these technologies are useful for creating efficiencies in undertaking their studies rather than seeking more collaborative participatory application (Henderson et al.,
2017
; Salam & Farooq,
2020
). Pedagogy must align with technology based learning environments and educational content be prioritised, rather than mapping new technologies onto out of date pedagogical models (Ananga,
2020
; Yelland & Tsembas,
2008
). This highlights the need for emphasising how technologies can establish student centric authentic experiences and guide or foster, rather than direct, a shared ownership of the learning environment (Qureshi et al.,
2023
). The divide between formal and informal learning can be challenging for teachers, as many technologies that facilitate learning are used by students outside the classroom (Moyle,
2010
), including seeking information from peers and experts through online communities. This can be challenging for academics where the boundaries between amateur and expert advice is ill defined (Abedi,
2023
). However, extending this information sharing to include professional practices and culture, can provide technology enabled authentic representations of learning (Harteis & Billett,
2023
).
Introducing new technologies for assessment can provide efficiencies for feedback design and assessment administration, but can also leverage the development of communication skills, interpersonal skills, and reflective practice. Peer and educational influences impact the development of self-sufficiency (Schunk & Mullen,
2012
; Zhang et al.,
2020
) and are important factors for the introduction of alternative assessments. Peer interaction (Qureshi et al.,
2023
) and the alignment of the blogs with assessment criteria are important aspects of this research design, and the connection to engagement (Martin,
2023
) and agency are analysed through the research data. Blogs provide students with an opportunity to observe and document the connections between what they learned and their experiences, which has been shown to improve reflective thinking skills (Ching & Hsu,
2010
). Strategies that facilitate successful pedagogical integration of technology into courses and assessment includes lecturer modelling of tools, creation of a learning support community, and providing sustained scaffolded interaction (Cochrane,
2012
; Obionwu et al.,
2022b
). The introduction of an alternative assessment design, like any innovation, requires careful monitoring of students and providing a supportive environment to ensure motivation and engagement is maintained (Martin,
2023
).
As graduates are increasingly working in interdisciplinary organisational teams with diverse functional areas of responsibility, there is a need for a shift to authentic learning and assessment (McArthur,
2023
). Authentic learning aims to align classroom-based activity with industry focused tasks and professional standards. It enables the development of attributes that are valued within industry settings (Le et al.,
2023
; Wiggins,
1990
). There is a preference for student online discussions that enable application of theory to industry situations (Harteis & Billett,
2023
; Lee & Martin,
2017
), and authentic assessment allows students to practice and complete tasks that simulate work-based activities. This develops employability capabilities, such as planning, communicating, workplace awareness, and interacting with others within discipline contexts (Villarroel et al.,
2018
). Ashford-Rowe et al. (
2014
) identified eight critical elements pertaining to the workplace, these include: challenge, performance or product (outcome), transfer of knowledge, metacognition, fidelity, accuracy, discussion and collaboration. These elements were incorporated in the design of the blog assessment activities.
Acquiring skills and knowledge during social interaction with more knowledgeable individuals involves a process of negotiating meaning through mediation, and is a key mechanism in development and learning (Alenezi,
2020
). The zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Baker et al.,
2020
; Vygotsky,
1978
) describes the gap between what a learner can achieve on their own, and what they are capable of achieving when assisted by others more experienced. In the context of this research, the ZPD involves a process of developing knowledge in an online environment with teachers, as well as other students mediated through blog based tools. Learner performance has been shown to improve when social processes mediate cognitive development (Bülow,
2022
; Puntambekar & Hübscher,
2005
) and this research examines collaborative social processes facilitated by blog based technology. The interactions of parameters that impact this development and how this mediates developmental activity can be described as an activity system (see Research methods for more on this) (Engeström,
2001
). Kahu (
2013
) conceptual holistic framework of student engagement places the student at the centre and examines institutional practice, engagement as an individual psycho-social process, and the role of the socio-political context. This framework connects engagement to activity theory through the examination of institutional parameters that impact on engaging students in achieving outcomes (El-Sabagh,
2021
).
Research methods
To evaluate whether blog based assessment improved course learning outcomes and helped to induct students into disciplinary and professional practices through authentic representations of learning, students from the course were invited to participate in the research project. The course,
Governance and Planning,
is a third year compulsory subject in the undergraduate planning degree. Students were informed about the research activity, the time requirements (about one hour) and that the teacher was only aware of which students had volunteered as research participants after their results had been submitted to the University.
Of the 67 students enrolled, 26 agreed to participate in the project. There was no obligation placed on these participants, and thus the sample group was effectively self-selected.
Data collection included a questionnaire, student evaluation survey, focus groups, and analysis of video and text based blog assessment tasks. 15 students responded to the questionnaire, 12 students participated in focus groups (seven in one group and five in the other), and 26 students allowed access to their blog assessment tasks. An additional data set included the university Course Experience Survey (CES), which is sent out to all students at the end of every semester for each course. 24 students responded to this survey, however as the surveys are anonymous this data does not correlate with the responses of project participants.
The study was conducted with Human Research Ethics Approval. A significant ethical risk arose regarding the unequal relationship between teacher and student, whereby the principal investigator was responsible for the assessment and feedback of the assessment task in the course. This risk was mitigated by collecting student survey and focus group data after results had been released to students, so their participation in the research did not have a detrimental effect on their assessment results. This risk was also mitigated as the co-investigator who conducted the focus groups was not involved in the delivery and assessment of the course.
There were 10 required blog topics each assessed to an individual criterion referenced rubric. The 10 blog posts accounted for 90% of the final grade, with the remaining 10% assessed through students’ peer reviewing two blog posts each week (see Table
1
). Assessment criteria in the rubrics were customised for the format of the blog post, which enabled the pedagogical integration and alignment of the blogging technology into the course and course assessments (see Appendix for full description of each blog post and assessment criteria). Teacher and peer interactions created a supportive learning community and provided sustained scaffolded knowledge development.

The qualitative data comprised of focus group recordings, survey and questionnaire feedback, and blog assessment task responses. This data was analysed using NVivo version 12 software (
https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo
; accessed June 2023) by identifying themes in the transcripts of the data. The themes were created by highlighting the transcript text and creating ‘nodes’. These nodes or meaning labels arose from the focus group and survey questions, while other nodes emerged through the interactions with participants while they reflected on their learning.
An activity theoretical (Engeström,
2001
) approach was adopted to analyse the data and uncover the differing understandings, motivations, and aspirations of teachers and students in the design and application of alternative assessment tasks. Engeström (
1987
) model of Activity Theory (Fig.
1
) illustrates how the effectiveness of any learning system is dependent upon the interplay of subjects and objects. The primary focus of activity systems analysis is the top triangle in the model where the production of any activity involves a subject, the object of the activity, the instruments that are used in the activity and the actions and operations that affect the outcome.

Understanding the blog activity system involves analysis of how transformation works in moving the subject (students) closer to the outcome (engagement in the discipline).
Implicit in activity systems are contradictions, and through consideration of these, an understanding of the transformation and development occurring in the activity system can be achieved. Activity systems are continually developing, and these developments involve interactions driven by contradictions. Engeström (
2015
) defined four types of contradictions.
First level contradictions are internally focused within activity system parameters (Fig.
1
). For this research project these are defined by the tensions experienced by students having to undertake non-conventional assessment methods; and teachers having to design and assess these new assessment types.
Second level contradictions occur between activity system parameters. They are defined for this study as the impact of assessment redesign and the mediating effect on the achievement of the outcome. All members in the community are impacted differently. Academics’ efforts in achieving a successful outcome can be hampered by institutional support for using new learning technologies, or workload models that do not accommodate trialling new assessment formats. Student responses to curriculum changes that are more authentic can cause tensions where they are unfamiliar with tertiary sector trends and policies, and often these contexts are not communicated well to student cohorts. For both students and teachers there are also the challenges of learning new software and understanding effective use of blogs as assessment tools.
Third level contradictions relate to the move to a more advanced object. For this research, this activity system this could include more sophisticated use of blogs with increased industry alignment. Possible tensions here could include the regulatory expectation that courses must undergo iterative review and refinement, yet assessment innovation can be time consuming and does not always guarantee a successful outcome. In addition trialling innovations are not always appreciated by students who often prefer defined processes (Bovill et al.,
2016
; Keeney-Kennicutt & Gunersel,
2008
). This can result in negative student survey responses, which is problematic for academics who rely on student survey responses for promotions and teaching awards.
The fourth level contradictions occur when tensions arise between different activity systems. For example, in this study these could describe tensions between this activity system where a blogging tool has been chosen by the teaching staff, and the IT roadmap for the university to choose and support specific learning technologies, which may not include the blog software.
Results
The evaluation of the experiential assessment is presented through an analysis of the activity systems involved in examining perceptions and communications among participants and identifying contradictions and confluences in the development and use of blog-based assessment tools. Three themes were identified and explored through the analysis, they are: (1) Promoting reflective practice and professional learning, (2) Facilitating peer review and feedback, and (3) Developing learning efficiencies and perceptions of value. The results from the data are presented within the three themes, followed by the results of the CES.
Promoting reflective practice and professional learning
The blogs resonated with students and promoted ongoing reflection about how the content connected with their future roles in the profession:
in your resume, or something like that, to show some work that you've done. And I think that would be good because you could show, say that you’re applying for a job at a local government, you could say that you've engaged with local government issues.
… the weekly post also kept me engaged with the course and I felt that governance was just always on my mind.
The alternative assessments really gets you thinking in different way, but more realistic like in the real world.
… helped me engage with the content. The requirement of this weeks post is to go to the council meeting and listen to what’s happening and then write what you thought about and how the council meeting actually works.
In particular, reflective practice was a highlight of the blog format, and students commented that having the opportunity to express themselves more frequently was conducive to greater engagement and understanding of the content:
… by having to talk about something every week I feel like I got a deeper understanding of the course material because I had to keep looking over it and staying up to date so this was a great course and I have learned so much about governance and planning…
I like the assignments because I feel like throughout the course I've never been given an opportunity to express myself and my thoughts about the course content in actual assignments.
… you’d have to think about what happened each week…and you had to really reflect on it properly.
… you engage with the content better... you actually learn what is happening in that area, rather than writing an essay.
The unfamiliarity of the assessment format created tensions in the execution of the assessments, however the teacher played a mediating role in encouraging authentic disciplinary engagement which is indicated in the following statements:
The teacher really pushes us to go out of our comfort zone for the assignments which is scary but ultimately good because as students going into the planning profession we should understand how community and council meetings run and are received by the community.
I guess the greatest challenge was learning to write concisely with a substantial amount of detail which in hindsight was perhaps good practice for us students as future planning practitioners.
Facilitating peer review and feedback
A significant function and format of a blog is the ability to share ideas and receive comments and feedback on blog posts. The comment function of the
Blogger
software was used as a mechanism for peer review and assessment. In addition to peer review, teachers gave more formal assessment feedback using criterion referenced rubrics on individual posts to students. Students commented on the effectiveness of this feedback, the analysis below focuses on how the feedback mediates transformation to the activity system outcome.
The assessment format was new to students, and it received a variety of responses initially. This included commentary around the informal nature of posting blogs and tensions whether there was academic merit in using blogs for summative assessment tasks and as a means of critical enquiry:
I personally really enjoyed blogging throughout the semester I thought it was a much more consistently engaging activity than other course assignments. I also thought that the reflection posts were really interesting to write and really made me think about the broader concepts of the course. I also enjoyed reading and commenting on blog posts of my fellow students and it was so great to be able to engage with so many different ideas throughout the semester
… overall the assessment of the blog post was great. It was a great experience peer reviewing other students work to have some insights and what they thought about the readings and lectures and just seeing the way that they write as well at times.
Peer review and feedback helped align the informal nature of the blog form to an academic context, as well as provide a mechanism to confirming that transformation was taking place.
Yeah, in the first couple of weeks, I had some people be like, “Oh, you could have used this reference better. Or, you should have referenced this. Or ...” That kind of thing. And I actually thought about that and thought, “Oh hey, I should actually work on the referencing.” Whereas, in later weeks, people would just be like, “Yup, great post.” And I’m like, “Okay, I’ll just keep going how I am.”
There was some criticism of the informal nature of the blogs, and as the quote below indicates there was also a tension in trying to introduce formal academic referencing while promoting reflective expression:
I didn’t really like this weekly blog thing as there was much confusion. Blogs are very casual and I should be able to express things the way I want to. Unfortunately we were restricted to use references which didn’t really help in me expressing myself.
Other students thought the assessment format was fun and engaging, indicating a successful development towards disciplinary learning, and this was leveraged through peer review and sharing personal reflections:
I really enjoyed exploring these new concepts in the form of the blog because it’s something I've never done before so it made the assignments feel a bit more fun and bit more interesting but the best part about this assessment format was being able to view my peers work and see how other people in my course felt about particular concepts or topics and innovations.
The teachers played a significant mediating role in ensuring the feedback furthered the transformation towards the outcome. The teachers’ feedback about effectively using peer review through the blog assessment tool and aligning it with the criteria enabled students to engage more deeply in peer discipline learning as well as promoting student feedback literacy (Carless & Boud,
2018
):
One more thing I wanted to say, I really like that at the end of the lectures, we got given feedback on generally what was good about the blogs and what a lot of people did poorly, because I found that my feedback didn’t really help me that much. It was never really clear to me how I could improve based on what they said. That kind of let me know, okay, this is what everyone else did and that's what worked. So I should try and do that.
Developing learning efficiencies and perceptions of value
The impacts on changing assessment types can be significant, and as represented in the activity system, it involves interactions of many parameters, which subsequently affect the motivations for teachers to trial alternative assessment types. The question for many teachers is whether the outcome is worth the effort? Perceived value of the introduction of the blog- based assessments are highly subjective, however the analysis of the data does indicate that perhaps it is worth the pain and their introduction facilitated student learning (Deng & Yuen,
2012
).
The tensions and contradictions within the activity system impacted some student participants, resulting in confusion, and for teacher participants an increased workload. These tensions are examined through analysis of the following student interview data to ascertain whether transformation is being blocked or mediated towards the outcome that discipline engagement is enhanced and is furthering student professional learning.
The frequency of weekly reflective blogs facilitated ongoing engagement with the content, and although there were comments from some students that this did not allow for in depth analysis, there was evidence that this enabled greater understanding of industry complexities, greater engagement with the content, and improving students’ ability to communicate ideas concisely:
… blogging as an assessment did take some weight off my shoulders because it was different from the standard format of a two thousand word essay the combination of course material and real-life experience like visiting a council meeting or a community meeting certainly helped me grasp the complexities that arise from different forms of governance.
… my growth and understanding of planning was a bit of fun in frustration while it is without a doubt easier to do 10 smaller assignments than three large assignments. I struggled with the word count some weeks I had to rephrase and rethink my ideas multiple times start writing up the blogs to be able to effectively get my points across while staying within the word count.
Teacher and student interactions were a highlight of the blog format and community mediated learning through the peer review mechanisms of the blog software facilitated increased engagement with the discipline:
I personally really enjoyed blogging throughout the semester. I thought it was a much more consistently engaging activity than other course assignments. I also thought that the reflection posts were really interesting to write and really made me think about the broader concepts of the course. I also enjoyed reading and commenting on blog posts of my fellow students and it was so great to be able to engage with so many different ideas throughout the semester.
I really enjoyed exploring these new concepts in the form of the blog because it’s something I've never done before so it made the assignments feel a bit more fun and bit more interesting, but the best part about this assessment format was being able to view my peers work and see how other people in my course felt about particular concepts or topics and innovations.
The community mediated learning was also evident in the transformation of teacher student interactions to assessment outcomes as indicated in the following comment:
I feel like I had a connection with the teacher. Just writing about stuff that she said, like, not direct quotes, but ideas that she presented in the course. Sort of like trickle into my blog.
Analysis of the data also indicated effective learning through assessment and efficiencies in the blog assessment format, which resonated with students. This included contradictions where students perceived that time spent on traditional essay- based assessments were more conducive to deeper learning:
I think not necessarily doing the blog, but I think just the weekly engagement of ... yeah. Just the weekly engagement constantly. I feel like I’ve done the least amount of work. I’ve done a lot of work, but I feel like I’ve done the least amount of effort for this subject, but I’ve got the most out of it.
… blogging throughout the semester was really enjoyable made me pay a lot more attention than other subjects with the usual three assessment tasks facing the blogpost of weekly contact made me a lot more engaged in the weekly topics overall.
… overall I’ve really enjoyed blogging for the scores. I think it's really lifted the weight off our shoulders in terms of the workload that we have to do and I found a reflective pieces really there's just a really good learning tool especially because this whole course is so content heavy there's just a lot of stuff to talk about and doing blog posts helps to really tie everything together bit by bit along with the other classes I feel like they really integrate well together.
Contrary to this, were comments from teaching staff about the workload associated with providing adequate feedback (Henderson et al.,
2019
), or the large number of individual posts. This created some tensions with students perceiving they were not getting adequate teacher feedback, and the peer reviews did not provide the expert response expected from students:
I don’t think I would be comfortable with someone, a student, grading my work and being… would they be responsible for the mark? Or just reviewing it?
And sometimes it took a while to get feedback. We had three backed up that we hadn’t got feedback on.
Student survey results
A Course Experience Survey (CES) was undertaken at the end of the semester. There were 24 respondents, as the university surveys are anonymous the data does not correlate with the responses of project participants. The two scores in the survey include 6 questions that constitute the Good Teaching Score (GTS) and one question that determines the Overall Satisfaction Index (OSI). For the
Governance and Planning
course the GTS score was 67.3% compared to 46.9% in the previous year, and the OSI was 60.9% compared to 45.8% in the previous year.
Discussion
This paper evaluated whether blog-based assessment improved learning outcomes for the course and helped to induct students into disciplinary and professional practices and cultures through productive and authentic representations of learning. Alternative assessment tasks were trialled in the course to improve motivation for students to acquire discipline knowledge and increase levels of engagement with the course content through students sharing their learnings with peers via blog mediated activity. Alignment of blog-based activity to industry focused tasks helped to create authentic representations of learning and assessment (Kruck & Teer,
2009
). The online interactions between students, teachers, and peers were focused on developing learner agency to construct knowledge through real world inputs that rely on the interpretation and reflection of discipline teaching. This approach supports simulated work-based activities and the application of theory to industry situations, which is preferred by students (Lee & Martin,
2017
).
Introducing this innovation caused tensions including students needing to develop a writing style that is appropriate for the blog format and reviewing and receiving peer submissions. There were concerns from students that there would be a devaluing of academic writing skills given the informal writing style of blogs, while others saw the benefit in blog-based assessments. The course coordinator relayed that in the context of the whole program there were other courses that relied heavily on more formal academic writing skills, so students would still develop these skills. This was important, because students’ perceptions towards blogging as a useful and collaborative academic activity relies on the teacher promoting the learning and assessment design as an authentic and relevant alternative (Garcia et al.,
2019
).
These contradictions are represented in other research studies that have shown students to find technology useful for creating efficiencies in managing their studies (Henderson et al.,
2017
). In addition, the informality of blog writing has been agued to a way to increase the diversity of industry related topics addressed by students, and perhaps academic essay assessment formats are not necessarily optimal for engaging with and learning industry based content and processes (Pinya & Rosselló,
2016
).
Teachers are an integral component of the ‘community’ in the activity system. Teachers provide guidance in discipline-based discussions and play a significant role in moving the subject closer to the outcome (see Fig.
1
). Motivation impacts academic performance (Kickert et al.,
2019
), and engagement is supported by agency and self-efficacy (Martin,
2012
). The teacher’s role in motivating students (Jang et al.,
2016
) is represented through a constructivist learning approach and ZPD (Vygotsky (
1978
), where the interactions between teacher and student describes the gap between what a learner can achieve on their own and what they achieve when supported by those more experienced. The teacher’s role as support and assessor are part of second level contradictions in the activity system, and the reflections by the teacher on how implementing innovations can create a more advanced activity system represent third level contradictions.
The decision to trial blogs as an alternative assessment strategy was based on previous feedback through CES about the course content being somewhat unengaging and dry. The design of the alternative blog based assessment created an opportunity for sustained scaffolded interactions across the whole ‘community’ to create engagement (Obionwu et al.,
2022a
). The contributions of guidance from social partners (Billett,
2015
, pp. 104–105) builds students’ skills to critically appraise and challenge the status quo of discipline knowledge in industry. These social partners include classmates who help to reduce the sense of isolation. Often students feel they get better feedback from peers than teachers (Zhang et al.,
2024
) and that reading other students' blogs helped in understanding course concepts (Ellison & Wu,
2008
).
There was an assumption that the predominately under 30-year-old demographic of students would be familiar with posting blogs. This assumption was based on the prevalence of media focus on the popularity of blogging and that the frequency of daily blog posts globally is currently over 6 million, with 600 million websites recognised as blogs (Chakarov,
2023
). When questioned how many students had blogged before only two out of the class of about 67 responded in the affirmative. Self-efficacy has a psychosocial influence on students’ engagement in learning, and peer and teacher support that fosters success in assessment activities has a positive impact on confidence (Farrell & Brunton,
2020
). This was articulated by students in their comments about teacher feedback on their blog posts, and a supportive approach helped in the development of self efficacy. This support included an induction that involved stepping students through setting up and using the blog software. Due to students’ unfamiliarity with the platform and the process for constructing posts, online feedback and support provided by both the teaching staff and co-investigator facilitated engagement.
As social media technologies are increasingly used as a component of the educational technology toolkit, questions about the preparedness of academics to shift their assessment design to capitalise on these technologies needs to be explored (Mimirinis,
2019
). Strategies and practices also need to be defined to enhance course and program learning outcomes without impacting negatively on academic workload or institutional risk. Capitalising on social media in higher education is a significant shift to the traditional university learning environment. The increased openness and transparency provides opportunities for improving the relevance and connectedness of courses. However, this also creates risks with regards to student privacy and academic integrity. As the shift in assessment moves into different spaces, we need to consider the framing of the development of students’ academic literacy and research skills, and how to provide guidelines that can adopt blogs, or other social media, and still maintain higher education standards.
Conclusion
The aim of this paper was the examine whether the alternative blog-based assessment approaches enhanced authentic representations of learning and helped to induct students into disciplinary and professional practices. The adoption of blogs as alternative assessment method did increase engagement with the content, enhance student learning and dialogue about the profession, and facilitate peer learning. Interactions between students, industry, and teachers exposed differing perspectives, that were highlighted within the activity system. Mediating factors such as teacher support and encouragement for trialling the new assessment format led to transformation and development of the activity system outcome.
The project examined how peer feedback and blogging impacted student knowledge and skill development and considered how to best implement these technologies to enhance disciplinary and professional practices. The results indicated the importance of providing guidance and support for students when implementing alternative assessment processes that involve new technologies. It was also evident that making assumptions about familiarity with and use of technology by student cohorts should be avoided. Much is made of generational differences both in social media and research (Dimock,
2019
), however such generalisations can impact negatively on ensuring all students engage with alternative assessment forms and develop new skills in using technology.
Considerations for further investigation could include longitudinal studies examining whether there was positive feedback from employers about graduates’ industry and professional understandings, and graduates sense of agency and self efficacy when applying for work or making industry connections. This research could also extend to analyses of mediating factors in the activity system that resolve the contradictions over time, such as designing efficiencies in feedback mechanisms and technology solutions, and integration of peer review strategies.
Limitations of the study include the small cohort size (26 students), however the richness of the transcripts from different sources- surveys, video blogs, focus groups, and questionnaires meant that the commentary provided a diverse array of data that enabled insightful analysis of the blog activity system. The authors also acknowledge that selecting 26 students through voluntary selection methods out of a cohort of 67 could result in differences in research artefacts between subjects and the rest of the cohort (Tseng,
2021
) due to factors such as individual student availability. However this would be minimal given the research artefacts are assessment tasks that all students (both particpant and non participant groups) completed as a course requirement, and the teacher was only aware of which students had volunteered as research subjects after results had been submitted to the University.

Abstract
This paper investigates the effectiveness of a blended learning environment through analyzing the relationship between student characteristics/background, design features and learning outcomes. It is aimed at determining the significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness taking student characteristics/background and design features as independent variables and learning outcomes as dependent variables. A survey was administered to 238 respondents to gather data on student characteristics/background, design features and learning outcomes. The final semester evaluation results were used as a measure for performance as an outcome. We applied the online self regulatory learning questionnaire for data on learner self regulation, the intrinsic motivation inventory for data on intrinsic motivation and other self-developed instruments for measuring the other constructs. Multiple regression analysis results showed that blended learning design features (technology quality, online tools and face-to-face support) and student characteristics (attitudes and self-regulation) predicted student satisfaction as an outcome. The results indicate that some of the student characteristics/backgrounds and design features are significant predictors for student learning outcomes in blended learning.
Introduction
The teaching and learning environment is embracing a number of innovations and some of these involve the use of technology through blended learning. This innovative pedagogical approach has been embraced rapidly though it goes through a process. The introduction of blended learning (combination of face-to-face and online teaching and learning) initiatives is part of these innovations but its uptake, especially in the developing world faces challenges for it to be an effective innovation in teaching and learning. Blended learning effectiveness has quite a number of underlying factors that pose challenges. One big challenge is about how users can successfully use the technology and ensuring participants’ commitment given the individual learner characteristics and encounters with technology (Hofmann,
2014
). Hofmann adds that users getting into difficulties with technology may result into abandoning the learning and eventual failure of technological applications. In a report by Oxford Group (
2013
), some learners (16%) had negative attitudes to blended learning while 26% were concerned that learners would not complete study in blended learning. Learners are important partners in any learning process and therefore, their backgrounds and characteristics affect their ability to effectively carry on with learning and being in blended learning, the design tools to be used may impinge on the effectiveness in their learning.
This study tackles blended learning effectiveness which has been investigated in previous studies considering grades, course completion, retention and graduation rates but no studies regarding effectiveness in view of learner characteristics/background, design features and outcomes have been done in the Ugandan university context. No studies have also been done on how the characteristics of learners and design features are predictors of outcomes in the context of a planning evaluation research (Guskey,
2000
) to establish the effectiveness of blended learning. Guskey (
2000
) noted that planning evaluation fits in well since it occurs before the implementation of any innovation as well as allowing planners to determine the needs, considering participant characteristics, analyzing contextual matters and gathering baseline information. This study is done in the context of a plan to undertake innovative pedagogy involving use of a learning management system (moodle) for the first time in teaching and learning in a Ugandan university. The learner characteristics/backgrounds being investigated for blended learning effectiveness include self-regulation, computer competence, workload management, social and family support, attitude to blended learning, gender and age. We investigate the blended learning design features of learner interactions, face-to-face support, learning management system tools and technology quality while the outcomes considered include satisfaction, performance, intrinsic motivation and knowledge construction. Establishing the significant predictors of outcomes in blended learning will help to inform planners of such learning environments in order to put in place necessary groundwork preparations for designing blended learning as an innovative pedagogical approach.
Kenney and Newcombe (
2011
) did their comparison to establish effectiveness in view of grades and found that blended learning had higher average score than the non-blended learning environment. Garrison and Kanuka (
2004
) examined the transformative potential of blended learning and reported an increase in course completion rates, improved retention and increased student satisfaction. Comparisons between blended learning environments have been done to establish the disparity between academic achievement, grade dispersions and gender performance differences and no significant differences were found between the groups (Demirkol & Kazu,
2014
).
However, blended learning effectiveness may be dependent on many other factors and among them student characteristics, design features and learning outcomes. Research shows that the failure of learners to continue their online education in some cases has been due to family support or increased workload leading to learner dropout (Park & Choi,
2009
) as well as little time for study. Additionally, it is dependent on learner interactions with instructors since failure to continue with online learning is attributed to this. In Greer, Hudson & Paugh’s study as cited in Park and Choi (
2009
), family and peer support for learners is important for success in online and face-to-face learning. Support is needed for learners from all areas in web-based courses and this may be from family, friends, co-workers as well as peers in class. Greer, Hudson and Paugh further noted that peer encouragement assisted new learners in computer use and applications. The authors also show that learners need time budgeting, appropriate technology tools and support from friends and family in web-based courses. Peer support is required by learners who have no or little knowledge of technology, especially computers, to help them overcome fears. Park and Choi, (
2009
) showed that organizational support significantly predicts learners’ stay and success in online courses because employers at times are willing to reduce learners’ workload during study as well as supervisors showing that they are interested in job-related learning for employees to advance and improve their skills.
The study by Kintu and Zhu (
2016
) investigated the possibility of blended learning in a Ugandan University and examined whether student characteristics (such as self-regulation, attitudes towards blended learning, computer competence) and student background (such as family support, social support and management of workload) were significant factors in learner outcomes (such as motivation, satisfaction, knowledge construction and performance). The characteristics and background factors were studied along with blended learning design features such as technology quality, learner interactions, and Moodle with its tools and resources. The findings from that study indicated that learner attitudes towards blended learning were significant factors to learner satisfaction and motivation while workload management was a significant factor to learner satisfaction and knowledge construction. Among the blended learning design features, only learner interaction was a significant factor to learner satisfaction and knowledge construction.
The focus of the present study is on examining the effectiveness of blended learning taking into consideration learner characteristics/background, blended learning design elements and learning outcomes and how the former are significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness.
Studies like that of Morris and Lim (
2009
) have investigated learner and instructional factors influencing learning outcomes in blended learning. They however do not deal with such variables in the contexts of blended learning design as an aspect of innovative pedagogy involving the use of technology in education. Apart from the learner variables such as gender, age, experience, study time as tackled before, this study considers social and background aspects of the learners such as family and social support, self-regulation, attitudes towards blended learning and management of workload to find out their relationship to blended learning effectiveness. Identifying the various types of learner variables with regard to their relationship to blended learning effectiveness is important in this study as we embark on innovative pedagogy with technology in teaching and learning.
Literature review
This review presents research about blended learning effectiveness from the perspective of learner characteristics/background, design features and learning outcomes. It also gives the factors that are considered to be significant for blended learning effectiveness. The selected elements are as a result of the researcher’s experiences at a Ugandan university where student learning faces challenges with regard to learner characteristics and blended learning features in adopting the use of technology in teaching and learning. We have made use of Loukis, Georgiou, and Pazalo (
2007
) value flow model for evaluating an e-learning and blended learning service specifically considering the effectiveness evaluation layer. This evaluates the extent of an e-learning system usage and the educational effectiveness. In addition, studies by Leidner, Jarvenpaa, Dillon and Gunawardena as cited in Selim (
2007
) have noted three main factors that affect e-learning and blended learning effectiveness as instructor characteristics, technology and student characteristics. Heinich, Molenda, Russell, and Smaldino (
2001
) showed the need for examining learner characteristics for effective instructional technology use and showed that user characteristics do impact on behavioral intention to use technology. Research has dealt with learner characteristics that contribute to learner performance outcomes. They have dealt with emotional intelligence, resilience, personality type and success in an online learning context (Berenson, Boyles, & Weaver,
2008
). Dealing with the characteristics identified in this study will give another dimension, especially for blended learning in learning environment designs and add to specific debate on learning using technology. Lin and Vassar, (
2009
) indicated that learner success is dependent on ability to cope with technical difficulty as well as technical skills in computer operations and internet navigation. This justifies our approach in dealing with the design features of blended learning in this study.
Learner characteristics/background and blended learning effectiveness
Studies indicate that student characteristics such as
gender
play significant roles in academic achievement (Oxford Group,
2013
), but no study examines performance of male and female as an important factor in blended learning effectiveness. It has again been noted that the success of e- and blended learning is highly dependent on experience in internet and
computer applications
(Picciano & Seaman,
2007
). Rigorous discovery of such competences can finally lead to a confirmation of high possibilities of establishing blended learning. Research agrees that the success of e-learning and blended learning can largely depend on students as well as teachers gaining
confidence
and capability to participate in blended learning (Hadad,
2007
). Shraim and Khlaif (
2010
) note in their research that 75% of students and 72% of teachers were lacking in skills to utilize ICT based learning components due to insufficient skills and experience in
computer and internet applications
and this may lead to failure in e-learning and blended learning. It is therefore pertinent that since the use of blended learning applies high usage of computers, computer competence is necessary (Abubakar & Adetimirin,
2015
) to avoid failure in applying technology in education for learning effectiveness. Rovai, (
2003
) noted that learners’
computer literacy
and
time management
are crucial in distance learning contexts and concluded that such factors are meaningful in online classes. This is supported by Selim (
2007
) that learners need to posses
time management
skills and computer skills necessary for effectiveness in e- learning and blended learning.
Self-regulatory
skills of time management lead to better performance and learners’ ability to structure the physical learning environment leads to efficiency in e-learning and blended learning environments. Learners need to seek helpful assistance from peers and teachers through chats, email and face-to-face meetings for effectiveness (Lynch & Dembo,
2004
). Factors such as learners’
hours of employment and family responsibilities
are known to impede learners’ process of learning, blended learning inclusive (Cohen, Stage, Hammack, & Marcus,
2012
). It was also noted that a common factor in failure and learner drop-out is the
time conflict
which is compounded by issues of
family
,
employment status
as well as
management support
(Packham, Jones, Miller, & Thomas,
2004
). A study by Thompson (
2004
) shows that
work, family, insufficient time
and
study load
made learners withdraw from online courses.
Learner
attitudes
to blended learning can result in its effectiveness and these shape behavioral intentions which usually lead to persistence in a learning environment, blended inclusive. Selim, (
2007
) noted that the learners’ attitude towards e-learning and blended learning are success factors for these learning environments. Learner performance by
age
and
gender
in e-learning and blended learning has been found to indicate no significant differences between male and female learners and different age groups (i.e. young, middle-aged and old above 45 years) (Coldwell, Craig, Paterson, & Mustard,
2008
). This implies that the potential for blended learning to be effective exists and is unhampered by gender or age differences.
Blended learning design features
The design features under study here include interactions, technology with its quality, face-to-face support and learning management system tools and resources.
Research shows that absence of learner
interaction
causes failure and eventual drop-out in online courses (Willging & Johnson,
2009
) and the lack of learner
connectedness
was noted as an internal factor leading to learner drop-out in online courses (Zielinski,
2000
). It was also noted that learners may not continue in e- and blended learning if they are unable to make friends thereby being disconnected and developing feelings of isolation during their blended learning experiences (Willging & Johnson, 2009). Learners’
Interactions
with teachers and peers can make blended learning effective as its absence makes learners withdraw (Astleitner,
2000
). Loukis, Georgious and Pazalo (2007) noted that learners’ measuring of a
system’s quality, reliability
and
ease of use
leads to learning efficiency and can be so in blended learning. Learner success in blended learning may substantially be affected by system functionality (Pituch & Lee,
2006
) and may lead to failure of such learning initiatives (Shrain,
2012
). It is therefore important to examine
technology quality
for ensuring learning effectiveness in blended learning. Tselios, Daskalakis, and Papadopoulou (
2011
) investigated learner perceptions after a learning management system use and found out that the actual system use determines the usefulness among users. It is again noted that a system with poor response time cannot be taken to be useful for e-learning and blended learning especially in cases of limited bandwidth (Anderson,
2004
). In this study, we investigate the use of Moodle and its tools as a function of potential effectiveness of blended learning.
The quality of learning management system content for learners can be a predictor of good performance in e-and blended learning environments and can lead to learner satisfaction. On the whole, poor
quality technology
yields no satisfaction by users and therefore the quality of technology significantly affects satisfaction (Piccoli, Ahmad, & Ives,
2001
). Continued navigation through a learning management system increases use and is an indicator of success in blended learning (Delone & McLean,
2003
). The efficient use of learning management system and its tools improves learning outcomes in e-learning and blended learning environments.
It is noted that learner
satisfaction
with a learning management system can be an antecedent factor for blended learning effectiveness. Goyal and Tambe (
2015
) noted that learners showed an appreciation to Moodle’s contribution in their learning. They showed positivity with it as it improved their understanding of course material (Ahmad & Al-Khanjari,
2011
). The study by Goyal and Tambe (
2015
) used descriptive statistics to indicate improved learning by use of uploaded syllabus and session plans on Moodle. Improved learning is also noted through sharing study material, submitting assignments and using the calendar. Learners in the study found Moodle to be an effective educational tool.
In blended learning set ups,
face-to-face
experiences form part of the blend and learner positive attitudes to such sessions could mean blended learning effectiveness. A study by Marriot, Marriot, and Selwyn (
2004
) showed learners expressing their preference for face-to-face due to its facilitation of social interaction and communication skills acquired from classroom environment. Their preference for the online session was only in as far as it complemented the traditional face-to-face learning. Learners in a study by Osgerby (
2013
) had positive perceptions of blended learning but preferred face-to-face with its step-by-stem instruction. Beard, Harper and Riley (
2004
) shows that some learners are successful while in a personal interaction with teachers and peers thus prefer face-to-face in the blend. Beard however dealt with a comparison between online and on-campus learning while our study combines both, singling out the face-to-face part of the blend. The advantage found by Beard is all the same relevant here because learners in blended learning express attitude to both online and face-to-face for an effective blend. Researchers indicate that teacher presence in face-to-face sessions lessens psychological distance between them and the learners and leads to greater learning. This is because there are verbal aspects like giving praise, soliciting for viewpoints, humor, etc and non-verbal expressions like eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, etc which make teachers to be closer to learners psychologically (Kelley & Gorham,
2009
).
Learner outcomes
The outcomes under scrutiny in this study include performance, motivation, satisfaction and knowledge construction. Motivation is seen here as an outcome because, much as cognitive factors such as course grades are used in measuring learning outcomes, affective factors like intrinsic motivation may also be used to indicate outcomes of learning (Kuo, Walker, Belland, & Schroder,
2013
). Research shows that high
motivation
among online learners leads to persistence in their courses (Menager-Beeley,
2004
). Sankaran and Bui (
2001
) indicated that less motivated learners performed poorly in knowledge tests while those with high learning motivation demonstrate high performance in academics (Green, Nelson, Martin, & Marsh,
2006
). Lim and Kim, (
2003
) indicated that learner interest as a motivation factor promotes learner involvement in learning and this could lead to learning effectiveness in blended learning.
Learner
satisfaction
was noted as a strong factor for effectiveness of blended and online courses (Wilging & Johnson, 2009) and dissatisfaction may result from learners’ incompetence in the use of the
learning management system
as an effective learning tool since, as Islam (
2014
) puts it, users may be dissatisfied with an information system due to ease of use. A lack of prompt feedback for learners from course instructors was found to cause dissatisfaction in an online graduate course. In addition, dissatisfaction resulted from technical difficulties as well as ambiguous course instruction Hara and Kling (
2001
). These factors, once addressed, can lead to learner satisfaction in e-learning and blended learning and eventual effectiveness. A study by Blocker and Tucker (
2001
) also showed that learners had difficulties with technology and inadequate group participation by peers leading to dissatisfaction within these design features. Student-teacher interactions are known to bring satisfaction within online courses. Study results by Swan (
2001
) indicated that student-teacher interaction strongly related with student satisfaction and high learner-learner interaction resulted in higher levels of course satisfaction. Descriptive results by Naaj, Nachouki, and Ankit (
2012
) showed that learners were satisfied with technology which was a video-conferencing component of blended learning with a mean of 3.7. The same study indicated student satisfaction with instructors at a mean of 3.8. Askar and Altun, (
2008
) found that learners were satisfied with face-to-face sessions of the blend with t-tests and ANOVA results indicating female scores as higher than for males in the satisfaction with face-to-face environment of the blended learning.
Studies comparing blended learning with traditional face-to-face have indicated that learners perform equally well in blended learning and their
performance
is unaffected by the delivery method (Kwak, Menezes, & Sherwood,
2013
). In another study, learning experience and performance are known to improve when traditional course delivery is integrated with online learning (Stacey & Gerbic,
2007
). Such improvement as noted may be an indicator of blended learning effectiveness. Our study however, delves into improved performance but seeks to establish the potential of blended learning effectiveness by considering grades obtained in a blended learning experiment. Score 50 and above is considered a pass in this study’s setting and learners scoring this and above will be considered to have passed. This will make our conclusions about the potential of blended learning effectiveness.
Regarding
knowledge construction,
it has been noted that effective learning occurs where learners are actively involved (Nurmela, Palonen, Lehtinen & Hakkarainen,
2003
, cited in Zhu,
2012
) and this may be an indicator of learning environment effectiveness. Effective blended learning would require that learners are able to initiate, discover and accomplish the processes of knowledge construction as antecedents of blended learning effectiveness. A study by Rahman, Yasin and Jusoff (
2011
) indicated that learners were able to use some steps to construct meaning through an online discussion process through assignments given. In the process of giving and receiving among themselves, the authors noted that learners learned by writing what they understood. From our perspective, this can be considered to be accomplishment in the knowledge construction process. Their study further shows that learners construct meaning individually from assignments and this stage is referred to as pre-construction which for our study, is an aspect of discovery in the knowledge construction process.
Predictors of blended learning effectiveness
Researchers have dealt with success factors for online learning or those for traditional face-to-face learning but little is known about factors that predict blended learning effectiveness in view of learner characteristics and blended learning design features. This part of our study seeks to establish the learner characteristics/backgrounds and design features that predict blended learning effectiveness with regard to satisfaction, outcomes, motivation and knowledge construction. Song, Singleton, Hill, and Koh (
2004
) examined online learning effectiveness factors and found out that time management (a self-regulatory factor) was crucial for successful online learning. Eom, Wen, and Ashill (
2006
) using a survey found out that interaction, among other factors, was significant for learner satisfaction. Technical problems with regard to instructional design were a challenge to online learners thus not indicating effectiveness (Song et al.,
2004
), though the authors also indicated that descriptive statistics to a tune of 75% and time management (62%) impact on success of online learning. Arbaugh (
2000
) and Swan (
2001
) indicated that high levels of learner-instructor interaction are associated with high levels of user satisfaction and learning outcomes. A study by Naaj et al. (
2012
) indicated that technology and learner interactions, among other factors, influenced learner satisfaction in blended learning.
Objective and research questions of the current study
The objective of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of blended learning in view of student satisfaction, knowledge construction, performance and intrinsic motivation and how they are related to student characteristics and blended learning design features in a blended learning environment.
Research questions
1.
What are the student characteristics and blended learning design features for an effective blended learning environment?
2.

Method
Research design
This research applies a quantitative design where descriptive statistics are used for the student characteristics and design features data, t-tests for the age and gender variables to determine if they are significant in blended learning effectiveness and regression for predictors of blended learning effectiveness.
This study is based on an experiment in which learners participated during their study using face-to-face sessions and an on-line session of a blended learning design. A learning management system (Moodle) was used and learner characteristics/background and blended learning design features were measured in relation to learning effectiveness. It is therefore a planning evaluation research design as noted by Guskey (
2000
) since the outcomes are aimed at blended learning implementation at MMU. The plan under which the various variables were tested involved face-to-face study at the beginning of a 17 week semester which was followed by online teaching and learning in the second half of the semester. The last part of the semester was for another face-to-face to review work done during the online sessions and final semester examinations. A questionnaire with items on student characteristics, design features and learning outcomes was distributed among students from three schools and one directorate of postgraduate studies.
Participants
Cluster sampling was used to select a total of 238 learners to participate in this study. Out of the whole university population of students, three schools and one directorate were used. From these, one course unit was selected from each school and all the learners following the course unit were surveyed. In the school of Education (
n
= 70) and Business and Management Studies (
n
= 133), sophomore students were involved due to the fact that they have been introduced to ICT basics during their first year of study. Students of the third year were used from the department of technology in the School of Applied Sciences and Technology (
n
= 18) since most of the year two courses had a lot of practical aspects that could not be used for the online learning part. From the Postgraduate Directorate (
n
= 17), first and second year students were selected because learners attend a face-to-face session before they are given paper modules to study away from campus.
The study population comprised of 139 male students representing 58.4% and 99 females representing 41.6% with an average age of 24 years.
Instruments
The end of semester results were used to measure learner performance. The online self-regulated learning questionnaire (Barnard, Lan, To, Paton, & Lai,
2009
) and the intrinsic motivation inventory (Deci & Ryan,
1982
) were applied to measure the constructs on self regulation in the student characteristics and motivation in the learning outcome constructs. Other self-developed instruments were used for the other remaining variables of attitudes, computer competence, workload management, social and family support, satisfaction, knowledge construction, technology quality, interactions, learning management system tools and resources and face-to-face support.
Instrument reliability
Cronbach’s alpha was used to test reliability and the table below gives the results. All the scales and sub-scales had acceptable internal consistency reliabilities as shown in Table
1
below:

Data analysis
First, descriptive statistics was conducted. Shapiro-Wilk test was done to test normality of the data for it to qualify for parametric tests. The test results for normality of our data before the
t-
test resulted into significant levels (Male = .003, female = .000) thereby violating the normality assumption. We therefore used the skewness and curtosis results which were between −1.0 and +1.0 and assumed distribution to be sufficiently normal to qualify the data for a parametric test, (Pallant,
2010
). An independent samples
t
-test was done to find out the differences in male and female performance to explain the gender characteristics in blended learning effectiveness. A one-way ANOVA between subjects was conducted to establish the differences in performance between age groups. Finally, multiple regression analysis was done between student variables and design elements with learning outcomes to determine the significant predictors for blended learning effectiveness.
Results
Student characteristics, blended learning design features and learning outcomes (
RQ1
)
A
t-
test was carried out to establish the performance of
male and female
learners in the blended learning set up. This was aimed at finding out if male and female learners do perform equally well in blended learning given their different roles and responsibilities in society. It was found that male learners performed slightly better (
M
= 62.5) than their female counterparts (
M
= 61.1). An independent
t
-test revealed that the difference between the performances was not statistically significant (
t
= 1.569,
df = 228, p
= 0.05, one tailed). The magnitude of the differences in the means is small with effect size (
d
= 0.18). A one way between subjects ANOVA was conducted on the performance of different
age
groups to establish the performance of learners of young and middle aged age groups (20–30, young & and 31–39, middle aged). This revealed a significant difference in performance (F(1,236 = 8.498,
p < .
001).
Average percentages of the items making up the self regulated learning scale are used to report the findings about all the sub-scales in the learner characteristics/background scale. Results show that
learner self-regulation
was good enough at 72.3% in all the sub-scales of goal setting, environment structuring, task strategies, time management, help-seeking and self-evaluation among learners. The least in the scoring was task strategies at 67.7% and the highest was learner environment structuring at 76.3%. Learner
attitude
towards blended learning environment is at 76% in the sub-scales of learner autonomy, quality of instructional materials, course structure, course interface and interactions. The least scored here is attitude to course structure at 66% and their attitudes were high on learner autonomy and course interface both at 82%. Results on the learners’
computer competences
are summarized in percentages in the table below (Table
2
):
Table 2 Learner computer competence results
Full size table
It can be seen that learners are skilled in word processing at 91%, email at 63.5%, spreadsheets at 68%, web browsers at 70.2% and html tools at 45.4%. They are therefore good enough in word processing and web browsing. Their computer confidence levels are reported at 75.3% and specifically feel very confident when it comes to working with a computer (85.7%). Levels of
family and social support
for learners during blended learning experiences are at 60.5 and 75% respectively. There is however a low score on learners being assisted by family members in situations of computer setbacks (33.2%) as 53.4% of the learners reported no assistance in this regard. A higher percentage (85.3%) is reported on learners getting support from family regarding provision of essentials for learning such as tuition. A big percentage of learners spend two hours on study while at home (35.3%) followed by one hour (28.2%) while only 9.7% spend more than three hours on study at home. Peers showed great care during the blended learning experience (81%) and their experiences were appreciated by the society (66%).
Workload management
by learners vis-à-vis studying is good at 60%. Learners reported that their workmates stand in for them at workplaces to enable them do their study in blended learning while 61% are encouraged by their bosses to go and improve their skills through further education and training. On the time spent on other activities not related to study, majority of the learners spend three hours (35%) while 19% spend 6 hours. Sixty percent of the learners have to answer to someone when they are not attending to other activities outside study compared to the 39.9% who do not and can therefore do study or those other activities.
Blended learning design features
The usability of the
online system, tools and resources
was below average as shown in the table below in percentages (Table
3
):
Table 3 Usability results of online system, tools and resources
Full size table
However, learners became skilled at navigating around the learning management system (79%) and it was easy for them to locate course content, tools and resources needed such as course works, news, discussions and journal materials. They effectively used the communication tools (60%) and to work with peers by making posts (57%). They reported that online resources were well organized, user friendly and easy to access (71%) as well as well structured in a clear and understandable manner (72%). They therefore recommended the use of online resources for other course units in future (78%) because they were satisfied with them (64.3%). On the whole, the online resources were fine for the learners (67.2%) and useful as a learning resource (80%). The learners’ perceived usefulness/satisfaction with online system, tools, and resources was at 81% as the LMS tools helped them to communicate, work with peers and reflect on their learning (74%). They reported that using moodle helped them to learn new concepts, information and gaining skills (85.3%) as well as sharing what they knew or learned (76.4%). They enjoyed the course units (78%) and improved their skills with technology (89%).
Learner interactions
were seen from three angles of cognitivism, collaborative learning and student-teacher interactions. Collaborative learning was average at 50% with low percentages in learners posting challenges to colleagues’ ideas online (34%) and posting ideas for colleagues to read online (37%). They however met oftentimes online (60%) and organized how they would work together in study during the face-to-face meetings (69%). The common form of communication medium frequently used by learners during the blended learning experience was by phone (34.5%) followed by whatsapp (21.8%), face book (21%), discussion board (11.8%) and email (10.9%). At the cognitive level, learners interacted with content at 72% by reading the posted content (81%), exchanging knowledge via the LMS (58.4%), participating in discussions on the forum (62%) and got course objectives and structure introduced during the face-to-face sessions (86%). Student-teacher interaction was reported at 71% through instructors individually working with them online (57.2%) and being well guided towards learning goals (81%). They did receive suggestions from instructors about resources to use in their learning (75.3%) and instructors provided learning input for them to come up with their own answers (71%).
The
technology quality
during the blended learning intervention was rated at 69% with availability of 72%, quality of the resources was at 68% with learners reporting that discussion boards gave right content necessary for study (71%) and the email exchanges containing relevant and much needed information (63.4%) as well as chats comprising of essential information to aid the learning (69%). Internet reliability was rated at 66% with a speed considered averagely good to facilitate online activities (63%). They however reported that there was intermittent breakdown during online study (67%) though they could complete their internet program during connection (63.4%). Learners eventually found it easy to download necessary materials for study in their blended learning experiences (71%).
Learner extent of use of the learning management system features was as shown in the table below in percentage (Table
4
):
Table 4 Extent of Moodle usage by learners
Full size table
From the table, very rarely used features include the blog and wiki while very often used ones include the email, forum, chat and calendar.
The effectiveness of the LMS was rated at 79% by learners reporting that they found it useful (89%) and using it makes their learning activities much easier (75.2%). Moodle has helped learners to accomplish their learning tasks more quickly (74%) and that as a LMS, it is effective in teaching and learning (88%) with overall satisfaction levels at 68%. However, learners note challenges in the use of the LMS regarding its performance as having been problematic to them (57%) and only 8% of the learners reported navigation while 16% reported access as challenges.
Learner attitudes towards
Face-to-face support
were reported at 88% showing that the sessions were enjoyable experiences (89%) with high quality class discussions (86%) and therefore recommended that the sessions should continue in blended learning (89%). The frequency of the face-to-face sessions is shown in the table below as preferred by learners (Table
5
).
Table 5 Learner preference of face-to-face frequency
Full size table
Learners preferred face-to-face sessions after every month in the semester (33.6%) and at the beginning of the blended learning session only (27.7%).
Learner outcomes
Learners reported high
intrinsic motivation
levels with interest and enjoyment of tasks at 83.7%, perceived competence at 70.2%, effort/importance sub-scale at 80%, pressure/tension reported at 54%. The pressure percentage of 54% arises from learners feeling nervous (39.2%) and a lot of anxiety (53%) while 44% felt a lot of pressure during the blended learning experiences. Learners however reported the value/usefulness of blended learning at 91% with majority believing that studying online and face-to-face had value for them (93.3%) and were therefore willing to take part in blended learning (91.2%). They showed that it is beneficial for them (94%) and that it was an important way of studying (84.3%).
Learner
satisfaction
was reported at 81% especially with instructors (85%) high percentage reported on encouraging learner participation during the course of study 93%, course content (83%) with the highest being satisfaction with the good relationship between the objectives of the course units and the content (90%), technology (71%) with a high percentage on the fact that the platform was adequate for the online part of the learning (76%), interactions (75%) with participation in class at 79%, and face-to-face sessions (91%) with learner satisfaction high on face-to-face sessions being good enough for interaction and giving an overview of the courses when objectives were introduced at 92%.
Learners’
knowledge construction
was reported at 78% with initiation and discovery scales scoring 84% with 88% specifically for discovering the learning points in the course units. The accomplishment scale in knowledge construction scored 71% and specifically the fact that learners were able to work together with group members to accomplish learning tasks throughout the study of the course units (79%). Learners developed reports from activities (67%), submitted solutions to discussion questions (68%) and did critique peer arguments (69%). Generally, learners performed well in blended learning in the final examination with an average pass of 62% and standard deviation of 7.5.
Significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness (
RQ 2)
A standard multiple regression analysis was done taking learner characteristics/background and design features as predictor variables and learning outcomes as criterion variables. The data was first tested to check if it met the linear regression test assumptions and results showed the correlations between the independent variables and each of the dependent variables (highest 0.62 and lowest 0.22) as not being too high, which indicated that multicollinearity was not a problem in our model. From the coefficients table, the VIF values ranged from 1.0 to 2.4, well below the cut off value of 10 and indicating no possibility of multicollinearity. The normal probability plot was seen to lie as a reasonably straight diagonal from bottom left to top right indicating normality of our data. Linearity was found suitable from the scatter plot of the standardized residuals and was rectangular in distribution. Outliers were no cause for concern in our data since we had only 1% of all cases falling outside 3.0 thus proving the data as a normally distributed sample. Our
R
-square values was at 0.525 meaning that the independent variables explained about 53% of the variance in overall satisfaction, motivation and knowledge construction of the learners. All the models explaining the three dependent variables of learner satisfaction, intrinsic motivation and knowledge construction were significant at the 0.000 probability level (Table
6
).
Table 6 Significant and non-significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness
Full size table
From the table above, design features (technology quality and online tools and resources), and learner characteristics (attitudes to blended learning, self-regulation) were significant predictors of learner satisfaction in blended learning. This means that good technology with the features involved and the learner positive attitudes with capacity to do blended learning with self drive led to their satisfaction. The design features (technology quality, interactions) and learner characteristics (self regulation and social support), were found to be significant predictors of learner knowledge construction. This implies that learners’ capacity to go on their work by themselves supported by peers and high levels of interaction using the quality technology led them to construct their own ideas in blended learning. Design features (technology quality, online tools and resources as well as learner interactions) and learner characteristics (self regulation), significantly predicted the learners’ intrinsic motivation in blended learning suggesting that good technology, tools and high interaction levels with independence in learning led to learners being highly motivated. Finally, none of the independent variables considered under this study were predictors of learning outcomes (grade).
Discussion
In this study we have investigated learning outcomes as dependent variables to establish if particular learner characteristics/backgrounds and design features are related to the outcomes for blended learning effectiveness and if they predict learning outcomes in blended learning. We took students from three schools out of five and one directorate of post-graduate studies at a Ugandan University. The study suggests that the characteristics and design features examined are good drivers towards an effective blended learning environment though a few of them predicted learning outcomes in blended learning.
Student characteristics/background, blended learning design features and learning outcomes
The learner characteristics, design features investigated are potentially important for an effective blended learning environment. Performance by gender shows a balance with no statistical differences between male and female. There are statistically significant differences (
p
< .005) in the performance between age groups with means of 62% for age group 20–30 and 67% for age group 31 –39. The indicators of self regulation exist as well as positive attitudes towards blended learning. Learners do well with word processing, e-mail, spreadsheets and web browsers but still lag below average in html tools. They show computer confidence at 75.3%; which gives prospects for an effective blended learning environment in regard to their computer competence and confidence. The levels of family and social support for learners stand at 61 and 75% respectively, indicating potential for blended learning to be effective. The learners’ balance between study and work is a drive factor towards blended learning effectiveness since their management of their workload vis a vis study time is at 60 and 61% of the learners are encouraged to go for study by their bosses. Learner satisfaction with the online system and its tools shows prospect for blended learning effectiveness but there are challenges in regard to locating course content and assignments, submitting their work and staying on a task during online study. Average collaborative, cognitive learning as well as learner-teacher interactions exist as important factors. Technology quality for effective blended learning is a potential for effectiveness though features like the blog and wiki are rarely used by learners. Face-to-face support is satisfactory and it should be conducted every month. There is high intrinsic motivation, satisfaction and knowledge construction as well as good performance in examinations (
M
= 62%, SD = 7.5); which indicates potentiality for blended learning effectiveness.
Significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness
Among the design features, technology quality, online tools and face-to-face support are predictors of learner satisfaction while learner characteristics of self regulation and attitudes to blended learning are predictors of satisfaction. Technology quality and interactions are the only design features predicting learner knowledge construction, while social support, among the learner backgrounds, is a predictor of knowledge construction. Self regulation as a learner characteristic is a predictor of knowledge construction. Self regulation is the only learner characteristic predicting intrinsic motivation in blended learning while technology quality, online tools and interactions are the design features predicting intrinsic motivation. However, all the independent variables are not significant predictors of learning performance in blended learning.
The high computer competences and confidence is an antecedent factor for blended learning effectiveness as noted by Hadad (
2007
) and this study finds learners confident and competent enough for the effectiveness of blended learning. A lack in computer skills causes failure in e-learning and blended learning as noted by Shraim and Khlaif (
2010
). From our study findings, this is no threat for blended learning our case as noted by our results. Contrary to Cohen et al. (
2012
) findings that learners’ family responsibilities and hours of employment can impede their process of learning, it is not the case here since they are drivers to the blended learning process. Time conflict, as compounded by family, employment status and management support (Packham et al.,
2004
) were noted as causes of learner failure and drop out of online courses. Our results show, on the contrary, that these factors are drivers for blended learning effectiveness because learners have a good balance between work and study and are supported by bosses to study. In agreement with Selim (
2007
), learner positive attitudes towards e-and blended learning environments are success factors. In line with Coldwell et al. (
2008
), no statistically significant differences exist between age groups. We however note that Coldwel, et al dealt with young, middle-aged and old above 45 years whereas we dealt with young and middle aged only.
Learner interactions at all levels are good enough and contrary to Astleitner, (
2000
) that their absence makes learners withdraw, they are a drive factor here. In line with Loukis (2007) the LMS quality, reliability and ease of use lead to learning efficiency as technology quality, online tools are predictors of learner satisfaction and intrinsic motivation. Face-to-face sessions should continue on a monthly basis as noted here and is in agreement with Marriot et al. (
2004
) who noted learner preference for it for facilitating social interaction and communication skills. High learner intrinsic motivation leads to persistence in online courses as noted by Menager-Beeley, (
2004
) and is high enough in our study. This implies a possibility of an effectiveness blended learning environment. The causes of learner dissatisfaction noted by Islam (
2014
) such as incompetence in the use of the LMS are contrary to our results in our study, while the one noted by Hara and Kling, (
2001
) as resulting from technical difficulties and ambiguous course instruction are no threat from our findings. Student-teacher interaction showed a relation with satisfaction according to Swan (
2001
) but is not a predictor in our study. Initiating knowledge construction by learners for blended learning effectiveness is exhibited in our findings and agrees with Rahman, Yasin and Jusof (
2011
). Our study has not agreed with Eom et al. (
2006
) who found learner interactions as predictors of learner satisfaction but agrees with Naaj et al. (
2012
) regarding technology as a predictor of learner satisfaction.
Conclusion and recommendations
An effective blended learning environment is necessary in undertaking innovative pedagogical approaches through the use of technology in teaching and learning. An examination of learner characteristics/background, design features and learning outcomes as factors for effectiveness can help to inform the design of effective learning environments that involve face-to-face sessions and online aspects. Most of the student characteristics and blended learning design features dealt with in this study are important factors for blended learning effectiveness. None of the independent variables were identified as significant predictors of student performance. These gaps are open for further investigation in order to understand if they can be significant predictors of blended learning effectiveness in a similar or different learning setting.
In planning to design and implement blended learning, we are mindful of the implications raised by this study which is a planning evaluation research for the design and eventual implementation of blended learning. Universities should be mindful of the interplay between the learner characteristics, design features and learning outcomes which are indicators of blended learning effectiveness. From this research, learners manifest high potential to take on blended learning more especially in regard to learner self-regulation exhibited. Blended learning is meant to increase learners’ levels of knowledge construction in order to create analytical skills in them. Learner ability to assess and critically evaluate knowledge sources is hereby established in our findings. This can go a long way in producing skilled learners who can be innovative graduates enough to satisfy employment demands through creativity and innovativeness. Technology being less of a shock to students gives potential for blended learning design. Universities and other institutions of learning should continue to emphasize blended learning approaches through installation of learning management systems along with strong internet to enable effective learning through technology especially in the developing world.

Abstract
This study addressed several outcomes, implications, and possible future directions for blended learning (BL) in higher education in a world where information communication technologies (ICTs) increasingly communicate with each other. In considering effectiveness, the authors contend that BL coalesces around access, success, and students’ perception of their learning environments. Success and withdrawal rates for face-to-face and online courses are compared to those for BL as they interact with minority status. Investigation of student perception about course excellence revealed the existence of robust if-then decision rules for determining how students evaluate their educational experiences. Those rules were independent of course modality, perceived content relevance, and expected grade. The authors conclude that although blended learning preceded modern instructional technologies, its evolution will be inextricably bound to contemporary information communication technologies that are approximating some aspects of human thought processes.
Introduction
Blended learning and research issues
Blended learning (BL), or the integration of face-to-face and online instruction (Graham
2013
), is widely adopted across higher education with some scholars referring to it as the “new traditional model” (Ross and Gage
2006
, p. 167) or the “new normal” in course delivery (Norberg et al.
2011
, p. 207). However, tracking the accurate extent of its growth has been challenging because of definitional ambiguity (Oliver and Trigwell
2005
), combined with institutions’ inability to track an innovative practice, that in many instances has emerged organically. One early nationwide study sponsored by the Sloan Consortium (now the Online Learning Consortium) found that 65.2% of participating institutions of higher education (IHEs) offered blended (also termed
hybrid
) courses (Allen and Seaman
2003
). A 2008 study, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education to explore distance education in the U.S., defined BL as “a combination of online and in-class instruction
with reduced in-class seat time for students
” (Lewis and Parsad
2008
, p. 1, emphasis added). Using this definition, the study found that 35% of higher education institutions offered blended courses, and that 12% of the 12.2 million documented distance education enrollments were in blended courses.
The 2017 New Media Consortium Horizon Report found that blended learning designs were one of the short term forces driving technology adoption in higher education in the next 1–2 years (Adams Becker et al.
2017
). Also, blended learning is one of the key issues in teaching and learning in the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative’s 2017 annual survey of higher education (EDUCAUSE
2017
). As institutions begin to examine BL instruction, there is a growing research interest in exploring the implications for both faculty and students. This modality is creating a community of practice built on a singular and pervasive research question, “How is blended learning impacting the teaching and learning environment?” That question continues to gain traction as investigators study the complexities of how BL interacts with cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of student behavior, and examine its transformation potential for the academy. Those issues are so compelling that several volumes have been dedicated to assembling the research on how blended learning can be better understood (Dziuban et al.
2016
; Picciano et al.
2014
; Picciano and Dziuban
2007
; Bonk and Graham
2007
; Kitchenham
2011
; Jean-François
2013
; Garrison and Vaughan
2013
) and at least one organization, the Online Learning Consortium, sponsored an annual conference solely dedicated to blended learning at all levels of education and training (2004–2015). These initiatives address blended learning in a wide variety of situations. For instance, the contexts range over K-12 education, industrial and military training, conceptual frameworks, transformational potential, authentic assessment, and new research models. Further, many of these resources address students’ access, success, withdrawal, and perception of the degree to which blended learning provides an effective learning environment.
Currently the United States faces a widening educational gap between our underserved student population and those communities with greater financial and technological resources (Williams
2016
). Equal access to education is a critical need, one that is particularly important for those in our underserved communities. Can blended learning help increase access thereby alleviating some of the issues faced by our lower income students while resulting in improved educational equality? Although most indicators suggest “yes” (Dziuban et al.
2004
), it seems that, at the moment, the answer is still “to be determined.” Quality education presents a challenge, evidenced by many definitions of what constitutes its fundamental components (Pirsig
1974
; Arum et al.
2016
). Although progress has been made by initiatives, such as, Quality Matters (
2016
), the OLC OSCQR Course Design Review Scorecard developed by Open SUNY (Open SUNY
n.d.
), the Quality Scorecard for Blended Learning Programs (Online Learning Consortium
n.d.
), and SERVQUAL (Alhabeeb
2015
), the issue is by no means resolved. Generally, we still make quality education a perceptual phenomenon where we ascribe that attribute to a course, educational program, or idea, but struggle with precisely why we reached that decision. Searle (
2015
), summarizes the problem concisely arguing that quality does not exist independently, but is entirely observer dependent. Pirsig (
1974
) in his iconic volume on the nature of quality frames the context this way,
“There is such thing as Quality, but that as soon as you try to define it, something goes haywire. You can’t do it” (p. 91).
Therefore, attempting to formulate a semantic definition of quality education with syntax-based metrics results in what O’Neil (O'Neil
2017
) terms
surrogate models
that are rough approximations and oversimplified. Further, the derived metrics tend to morph into goals or benchmarks, losing their original measurement properties (Goodhart
1975
).
Information communication technologies in society and education
Blended learning forces us to consider the characteristics of digital technology, in general, and information communication technologies (ICTs), more specifically. Floridi (
2014
) suggests an answer proffered by Alan Turing: that digital ICTs can process information on their own, in some sense just as humans and other biological life. ICTs can also communicate information to each other, without human intervention, but as linked processes designed by humans. We have evolved to the point where humans are not always “in the loop” of technology, but should be “on the loop” (Floridi
2014
, p. 30), designing and adapting the process. We perceive our world more and more in informational terms, and not primarily as physical entities (Floridi
2008
). Increasingly, the educational world is dominated by information and our economies rest primarily on that asset. So our world is also blended, and it is blended so much that we hardly see the individual components of the blend any longer. Floridi (
2014
) argues that the world has become an “infosphere” (like biosphere) where we live as “inforgs.” What is real for us is shifting from the physical and unchangeable to those things with which we can interact.
Floridi also helps us to identify the next blend in education, involving ICTs, or specialized artificial intelligence (Floridi
2014
, 25; Norberg
2017
, 65). Learning analytics, adaptive learning, calibrated peer review, and automated essay scoring (Balfour
2013
) are advanced processes that, provided they are good interfaces, can work well with the teacher— allowing him or her to concentrate on human attributes such as being caring, creative, and engaging in problem-solving. This can, of course, as with all technical advancements, be used to save resources and augment the role of the teacher. For instance, if artificial intelligence can be used to work along with teachers, allowing them more time for personal feedback and mentoring with students, then, we will have made a transformational breakthrough. The Edinburg University manifesto for teaching online says bravely, “Automation need not impoverish education – we welcome our robot colleagues” (Bayne et al.
2016
). If used wisely, they will teach us more about ourselves, and about what is truly human in education. This emerging blend will also affect curricular and policy questions, such as the
what?
and
what for?
The new normal for education will be in perpetual flux. Floridi’s (
2014
) philosophy offers us tools to understand and be in control and not just sit by and watch what happens. In many respects, he has addressed the new normal for blended learning.
Literature of blended learning
A number of investigators have assembled a comprehensive agenda of transformative and innovative research issues for blended learning that have the potential to enhance effectiveness (Garrison and Kanuka
2004
; Picciano
2009
). Generally, research has found that BL results in improvement in student success and satisfaction, (Dziuban and Moskal
2011
; Dziuban et al.
2011
; Means et al.
2013
) as well as an improvement in students’ sense of community (Rovai and Jordan
2004
) when compared with face-to-face courses. Those who have been most successful at blended learning initiatives stress the importance of institutional support for course redesign and planning (Moskal et al.
2013
; Dringus and Seagull
2015
; Picciano
2009
; Tynan et al.
2015
). The evolving research questions found in the literature are long and demanding, with varied definitions of what constitutes “blended learning,” facilitating the need for continued and in-depth research on instructional models and support needed to maximize achievement and success (Dringus and Seagull
2015
; Bloemer and Swan
2015
).
Educational access
The lack of access to educational technologies and innovations (sometimes termed the digital divide) continues to be a challenge with novel educational technologies (Fairlie
2004
; Jones et al.
2009
). One of the promises of online technologies is that they can increase access to nontraditional and underserved students by bringing a host of educational resources and experiences to those who may have limited access to on-campus-only higher education. A 2010 U.S. report shows that students with low socioeconomic status are less likely to obtain higher levels of postsecondary education (Aud et al.
2010
). However, the increasing availability of distance education has provided educational opportunities to millions (Lewis and Parsad
2008
; Allen et al.
2016
). Additionally, an emphasis on open educational resources (OER) in recent years has resulted in significant cost reductions without diminishing student performance outcomes (Robinson et al.
2014
; Fischer et al.
2015
; Hilton et al.
2016
).
Unfortunately, the benefits of access may not be experienced evenly across demographic groups. A 2015 study found that Hispanic and Black STEM majors were significantly less likely to take online courses even when controlling for academic preparation, socioeconomic status (SES), citizenship, and English as a second language (ESL) status (Wladis et al.
2015
). Also, questions have been raised about whether the additional access afforded by online technologies has actually resulted in improved outcomes for underserved populations. A distance education report in California found that all ethnic minorities (except Asian/Pacific Islanders) completed distance education courses at a lower rate than the ethnic majority (California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office
2013
). Shea and Bidjerano (
2014
,
2016
) found that African American community college students who took distance education courses completed degrees at significantly lower rates than those who did not take distance education courses. On the other hand, a study of success factors in K-12 online learning found that for ethnic minorities, only 1 out of 15 courses had significant gaps in student test scores (Liu and Cavanaugh
2011
). More research needs to be conducted, examining access and success rates for different populations, when it comes to learning in different modalities, including fully online and blended learning environments.
Framing a treatment effect
Over the last decade, there have been at least five meta-analyses that have addressed the impact of blended learning environments and its relationship to learning effectiveness (Zhao et al.
2005
; Sitzmann et al.
2006
; Bernard et al.
2009
; Means et al.
2010
,
2013
; Bernard et al.
2014
). Each of these studies has found small to moderate positive effect sizes in favor of blended learning when compared to fully online or traditional face-to-face environments. However, there are several considerations inherent in these studies that impact our understanding the generalizability of outcomes.
Dziuban and colleagues (Dziuban et al.
2015
) analyzed the meta-analyses conducted by Means and her colleagues (Means et al.
2013
; Means et al.
2010
), concluding that their methods were impressive as evidenced by exhaustive study inclusion criteria and the use of scale-free effect size indices. The conclusion, in both papers, was that there was a modest difference in multiple outcome measures for courses featuring online modalities—in particular, blended courses. However, with blended learning especially, there are some concerns with these kinds of studies. First, the effect sizes are based on the linear hypothesis testing model with the underlying assumption that the treatment and the error terms are uncorrelated, indicating that there is nothing else going on in the blending that might confound the results. Although the blended learning articles (Means et al.
2010
) were carefully vetted, the assumption of independence is tenuous at best so that these meta-analysis studies must be interpreted with extreme caution.
There is an additional concern with blended learning as well. Blends are not equivalent because of the manner on which they are configured. For instance, a careful reading of the sources used in the Means, et al. papers will identify, at minimum, the following blending techniques: laboratory assessments, online instruction, e-mail, class web sites, computer laboratories, mapping and scaffolding tools, computer clusters, interactive presentations and e-mail, handwriting capture, evidence-based practice, electronic portfolios, learning management systems, and virtual apparatuses. These are not equivalent ways in which to configure courses, and such nonequivalence constitutes the confounding we describe. We argue here that, in actuality, blended learning is a general construct in the form of a boundary object (Star and Griesemer
1989
) rather than a treatment effect in the statistical sense. That is, an idea or concept that can support a community of practice, but is weakly defined fostering disagreement in the general group. Conversely, it is stronger in individual constituencies. For instance, content disciplines (i.e. education, rhetoric, optics, mathematics, and philosophy) formulate a more precise definition because of commonly embraced teaching and learning principles. Quite simply, the situation is more complicated than that, as Leonard Smith (
2007
) says after Tolstoy,
“All linear models resemble each other, each non nonlinear system is unique in its own way” (p. 33).
This by no means invalidates these studies, but effect size associated with blended learning should be interpreted with caution where the impact is evaluated within a particular learning context.
Study objectives
This study addressed student access by examining success and withdrawal rates in the blended learning courses by comparing them to face-to-face and online modalities over an extended time period at the University of Central Florida. Further, the investigators sought to assess the differences in those success and withdrawal rates with the minority status of students. Secondly, the investigators examined the student end-of-course ratings of blended learning and other modalities by attempting to develop robust if-then decision rules about what characteristics of classes and instructors lead students to assign an “excellent” value to their educational experience. Because of the high stakes nature of these student ratings toward faculty promotion, awards, and tenure, they act as a surrogate measure for instructional quality. Next, the investigators determined the conditional probabilities for students conforming to the identified rule cross-referenced by expected grade, the degree to which they desired to take the course, and course modality.
Methods
Student grades by course modality were recoded into a binary variable with C or higher assigned a value of 1, and remaining values a 0. This was a declassification process that sacrificed some specificity but compensated for confirmation bias associated with disparate departmental policies regarding grade assignment. At the measurement level this was an “on track to graduation index” for students. Withdrawal was similarly coded by the presence or absence of its occurrence. In each case, the percentage of students succeeding or withdrawing from blended, online or face-to-face courses was calculated by minority and non-minority status for the fall 2014 through fall 2015 semesters.
Next, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis (Brieman et al.
1984
) was performed on the student end-of-course evaluation protocol (
Appendix 1
). The dependent measure was a binary variable indicating whether or not a student assigned an overall rating of excellent to his or her course experience. The independent measures in the study were: the remaining eight rating items on the protocol, college membership, and course level (lower undergraduate, upper undergraduate, and graduate). Decision trees are efficient procedures for achieving effective solutions in studies such as this because with missing values imputation may be avoided with procedures such as floating methods and the surrogate formation (Brieman et al.
1984
, Olshen et al.
1995
). For example, a logistic regression method cannot efficiently handle all variables under consideration. There are 10 independent variables involved here; one variable has three levels, another has nine, and eight have five levels each. This means the logistic regression model must incorporate more than 50 dummy variables and an excessively large number of two-way interactions. However, the decision-tree method can perform this analysis very efficiently, permitting the investigator to consider higher order interactions. Even more importantly, decision trees represent appropriate methods in this situation because many of the variables are ordinally scaled. Although numerical values can be assigned to each category, those values are not unique. However, decision trees incorporate the ordinal component of the variables to obtain a solution. The rules derived from decision trees have an
if-then
structure that is readily understandable. The accuracy of these rules can be assessed with percentages of correct classification or odds-ratios that are easily understood. The procedure produces tree-like rule structures that predict outcomes.
The model-building procedure for predicting overall instructor rating
For this study, the investigators used the CART method (Brieman et al.
1984
) executed with SPSS 23 (IBM Corp
2015
). Because of its strong variance-sharing tendencies with the other variables, the dependent measure for the analysis was the rating on the item
Overall Rating of the Instructor
, with the previously mentioned indicator variables (college, course level, and the remaining 8 questions) on the instrument. Tree methods are recursive, and bisect data into subgroups called nodes or leaves. CART analysis bases itself on: data splitting, pruning, and homogeneous assessment.
Splitting the data into two (binary) subsets comprises the first stage of the process. CART continues to split the data until the frequencies in each subset are either very small or all observations in a subset belong to one category (e.g., all observations in a subset have the same rating). Usually the growing stage results in too many terminate nodes for the model to be useful. CART solves this problem using pruning methods that reduce the dimensionality of the system.
The final stage of the analysis involves assessing homogeneousness in growing and pruning the tree. One way to accomplish this is to compute the misclassification rates. For example, a rule that produces a .95 probability that an instructor will receive an excellent rating has an associated error of 5.0%.
Implications for using decision trees
Although decision-tree techniques are effective for analyzing datasets such as this, the reader should be aware of certain limitations. For example, since trees use ranks to analyze both ordinal and interval variables, information can be lost. However, the most serious weakness of decision tree analysis is that the results can be unstable because small initial variations can lead to substantially different solutions.
For this study model, these problems were addressed with the k-fold cross-validation process. Initially the dataset was partitioned randomly into 10 subsets with an approximately equal number of records in each subset. Each cohort is used as a test partition, and the remaining subsets are combined to complete the function. This produces 10 models that are all trained on different subsets of the original dataset and where each has been used as the test partition one time only.
Although computationally dense, CART was selected as the analysis model for a number of reasons— primarily because it provides easily interpretable rules that readers will be able evaluate in their particular contexts. Unlike many other multivariate procedures that are even more sensitive to initial estimates and require a good deal of statistical sophistication for interpretation, CART has an intuitive resonance with researcher consumers. The overriding objective of our choice of analysis methods was to facilitate readers’ concentration on our outcomes rather than having to rely on our interpretation of the results.
Results
Institution-level evaluation: Success and withdrawal
The University of Central Florida (UCF) began a longitudinal impact study of their online and blended courses at the start of the distributed learning initiative in 1996. The collection of similar data across multiple semesters and academic years has allowed UCF to monitor trends, assess any issues that may arise, and provide continual support for both faculty and students across varying demographics. Table
1
illustrates the overall success rates in blended, online and face-to-face courses, while also reporting their variability across minority and non-minority demographics.

While success (A, B, or C grade) is not a direct reflection of learning outcomes, this overview does provide an institutional level indication of progress and possible issues of concern. BL has a slight advantage when looking at overall success and withdrawal rates. This varies by discipline and course, but generally UCF’s blended modality has evolved to be the best of both worlds, providing an opportunity for optimizing face-to-face instruction through the effective use of online components. These gains hold true across minority status. Reducing on-ground time also addresses issues that impact both students and faculty such as parking and time to reach class. In addition, UCF requires faculty to go through faculty development tailored to teaching in either blended or online modalities. This 8-week faculty development course is designed to model blended learning, encouraging faculty to redesign their course and not merely consider blended learning as a means to move face-to-face instructional modules online (Cobb et al.
2012
; Lowe
2013
).
Withdrawal (Table
2
) from classes impedes students’ success and retention and can result in delayed time to degree, incurred excess credit hour fees, or lost scholarships and financial aid. Although grades are only a surrogate measure for learning, they are a strong predictor of college completion. Therefore, the impact of any new innovation on students’ grades should be a component of any evaluation. Once again, the blended modality is competitive and in some cases results in lower overall withdrawal rates than either fully online or face-to-face courses.

The students’ perceptions of their learning environments
Other potentially high-stakes indicators can be measured to determine the impact of an innovation such as blended learning on the academy. For instance, student satisfaction and attitudes can be measured through data collection protocols, including common student ratings, or student perception of instruction instruments. Given that those ratings often impact faculty evaluation, any negative reflection can derail the successful implementation and scaling of an innovation by disenfranchised instructors. In fact, early online and blended courses created a request by the UCF faculty senate to investigate their impact on faculty ratings as compared to face-to-face sections. The UCF Student Perception of Instruction form is released automatically online through the campus web portal near the end of each semester. Students receive a splash page with a link to each course’s form. Faculty receive a scripted email that they can send to students indicating the time period that the ratings form will be available. The forms close at the beginning of finals week. Faculty receive a summary of their results following the semester end.
The instrument used for this study was developed over a ten year period by the faculty senate of the University of Central Florida, recognizing the evolution of multiple course modalities including blended learning. The process involved input from several constituencies on campus (students, faculty, administrators, instructional designers, and others), in attempt to provide useful formative and summative instructional information to the university community. The final instrument was approved by resolution of the senate and, currently, is used across the university. Students’ rating of their classes and instructors comes with considerable controversy and disagreement with researchers aligning themselves on both sides of the issue. Recently, there have been a number of studies criticizing the process (Uttl et al.
2016
; Boring et al.
2016
; & Stark and Freishtat
2014
). In spite of this discussion, a viable alternative has yet to emerge in higher education. So in the foreseeable future, the process is likely to continue. Therefore, with an implied faculty senate mandate this study was initiated by this team of researchers.
Prior to any analysis of the item responses collected in this campus-wide student sample, the psychometric quality (domain sampling) of the information yielded by the instrument was assessed. Initially, the reliability (internal consistency) was derived using coefficient alpha (Cronbach
1951
). In addition, Guttman (
1953
) developed a theorem about item properties that leads to evidence about the quality of one’s data, demonstrating that as the domain sampling properties of items improve, the inverse of the correlation matrix among items will approach a diagonal. Subsequently, Kaiser and Rice (
1974
) developed the measure of sampling adequacy (MSA) that is a function of the Guttman Theorem. The index has an upper bound of one with Kaiser offering some decision rules for interpreting the value of MSA. If the value of the index is in the .80 to .99 range, the investigator has evidence of an excellent domain sample. Values in the .70s signal an acceptable result, and those in the .60s indicate data that are unacceptable. Customarily, the MSA has been used for data assessment prior to the application of any dimensionality assessments. Computation of the MSA value gave the investigators a benchmark for the construct validity of the items in this study. This procedure has been recommended by Dziuban and Shirkey (
1974
) prior to any latent dimension analysis and was used with the data obtained for this study. The MSA for the current instrument was .98 suggesting excellent domain sampling properties with an associated alpha reliability coefficient of .97 suggesting superior internal consistency. The psychometric properties of the instrument were excellent with both measures.
The online student ratings form presents an electronic data set each semester. These can be merged across time to create a larger data set of completed ratings for every course across each semester. In addition, captured data includes course identification variables including prefix, number, section and semester, department, college, faculty, and class size. The overall rating of effectiveness is used most heavily by departments and faculty in comparing across courses and modalities (Table
3
).
Table 3 A decision rule for the probability of faculty member receiving an overall rating of excellent (

= 58,156)
Full size table
The finally derived tree (decision rules) included only three variables—survey items that asked students to rate the instructor’s effectiveness at:
1.
Helping students achieve course objectives,
2.
Creating an environment that helps students learn, and
3.
Communicating ideas and information.
None of the demographic variables associated with the courses contributed to the final model. The final rule specifies that if a student assigns an excellent rating to those three items, irrespective of their status on any other condition, the probability is .99 that an instructor will receive an overall rating of excellent. The converse is true as well. A poor rating on all three of those items will lead to a 99% chance of an instructor receiving an overall rating of poor.

In each case, irrespective of the marginal probabilities, those students conforming to the rule have a virtually 100% chance of seeing the course as excellent. For instance, 27% of all students expecting to fail assigned an excellent rating to their courses, but when they conformed to the rule the percentage rose to 97%. The same finding is true when students were asked about their desire to take the course with those who strongly disagreed assigning excellent ratings to their courses 26% of the time. However, for those conforming to the rule, that category rose to 92%. When course modality is considered in the marginal sense, blended learning is rated as the preferred choice. However, from Table
6
we can observe that the rule equates student assessment of their learning experiences. If they conform to the rule, they will see excellence.
Conclusion
This study addressed increasingly important issues of student success, withdrawal and perception of the learning environment across multiple course modalities. Arguably these components form the crux of how we will make more effective decisions about how blended learning configures itself in the new normal. The results reported here indicate that blending maintains or increases access for most student cohorts and produces improved success rates for minority and non-minority students alike. In addition, when students express their beliefs about the effectiveness of their learning environments, blended learning enjoys the number one rank. However, upon more thorough analysis of key elements students view as important in their learning, external and demographic variables have minimal impact on those decisions. For example college (i.e. discipline) membership, course level or modality, expected grade or desire to take a particular course have little to do with their course ratings. The characteristics they view as important relate to clear establishment and progress toward course objectives, creating an effective learning environment and the instructors’ effective communication. If in their view those three elements of a course are satisfied they are virtually guaranteed to evaluate their educational experience as excellent irrespective of most other considerations. While end of course rating protocols are summative the three components have clear formative characteristics in that each one is directly related to effective pedagogy and is responsive to faculty development through units such as the faculty center for teaching and learning. We view these results as encouraging because they offer potential for improving the teaching and learning process in an educational environment that increases the pressure to become more responsive to contemporary student lifestyles.
Discussion
Clearly, in this study we are dealing with complex adaptive systems that feature the emergent property. That is, their primary agents and their interactions comprise an environment that is more than the linear combination of their individual elements. Blending learning, by interacting with almost every aspect of higher education, provides opportunities and challenges that we are not able to fully anticipate.
This pedagogy alters many assumptions about the most effective way to support the educational environment. For instance, blending, like its counterpart active learning, is a personal and individual phenomenon experienced by students. Therefore, it should not be surprising that much of what we have called blended learning is, in reality, blended teaching that reflects pedagogical arrangements. Actually, the best we can do for assessing impact is to use surrogate measures such as success, grades, results of assessment protocols, and student testimony about their learning experiences. Whether or not such devices are valid indicators remains to be determined. We may be well served, however, by changing our mode of inquiry to blended teaching.
Additionally, as Norberg (
2017
) points out, blended learning is not new. The modality dates back, at least, to the medieval period when the technology of textbooks was introduced into the classroom where, traditionally, the professor read to the students from the only existing manuscript. Certainly, like modern technologies, books were disruptive because they altered the teaching and learning paradigm. Blended learning might be considered what Johnson describes as a slow hunch (2010). That is, an idea that evolved over a long period of time, achieving what Kaufmann (
2000
) describes as the adjacent possible – a realistic next step occurring in many iterations.
The search for a definition for blended learning has been productive, challenging, and, at times, daunting. The definitional continuum is constrained by Oliver and Trigwell (
2005
) castigation of the concept for its imprecise vagueness to Sharpe et al.’s (
2006
) notion that its definitional latitude enhances contextual relevance. Both extremes alter boundaries such as time, place, presence, learning hierarchies, and space. The disagreement leads us to conclude that Lakoff’s (
2012
) idealized cognitive models i.e. arbitrarily derived concepts (of which blended learning might be one) are necessary if we are to function effectively. However, the strong possibility exists that blended learning, like quality, is observer dependent and may not exist outside of our perceptions of the concept. This, of course, circles back to the problem of assuming that blending is a treatment effect for point hypothesis testing and meta-analysis.
Ultimately, in this article, we have tried to consider theoretical concepts and empirical findings about blended learning and their relationship to the new normal as it evolves. Unfortunately, like unresolved chaotic solutions, we cannot be sure that there is an attractor or that it will be the new normal. That being said, it seems clear that blended learning is the harbinger of substantial change in higher education and will become equally impactful in K-12 schooling and industrial training. Blended learning, because of its flexibility, allows us to maximize many positive education functions. If Floridi (
2014
) is correct and we are about to live in an environment where we are on the communication loop rather than in it, our educational future is about to change. However, if our results are correct and not over fit to the University of Central Florida and our theoretical speculations have some validity, the future of blended learning should encourage us about the coming changes.

Abstract
The COVID-19 outbreak has compelled many universities to immediately switch to the online delivery of lessons. Many instructors, however, have found developing effective online lessons in a very short period of time very stressful and difficult. This study describes how we successfully addressed this crisis by transforming two conventional flipped classes into
fully online
flipped classes with the help of a cloud-based video conferencing app. As in a conventional flipped course, in a fully online flipped course students are encouraged to complete online pre-class work. But unlike in the conventional flipped approach, students do not subsequently meet face-to-face in physical classrooms, but rather online. This study examines the effect of fully online flipped classrooms on student learning performance in two stages. In Stage One, we explain how we drew on the 5E framework to design two conventional flipped classes. The 5E framework consists of five phases—Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. In Stage Two, we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes. Quantitative analyses of students’ final course marks reveal that the participants in the fully online flipped classes performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning classes. Our qualitative analyses of student and staff reflection data identify seven good practices for videoconferencing

assisted online flipped classrooms.
Introduction
“It’s now painfully clear that schools ought to have had more robust disaster-preparedness plans in place in the event of interruptions in their campus operations. But because many schools did not have such plans in place…online learning is about to get a bad reputation at many campuses, I suspect.” Michael Horn, cited in Lederman (
2020
), ‘Inside Higher Ed’.
In early January 2020, scientists identified a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to schools and universities. According to UNESCO, as of April 10, 2020, more than 188 countries had implemented nationwide school and university closures, impacting over 91% of the world’s student population (UNESCO n.d.).
During these school closures, all face-to-face lessons were cancelled, compelling many institutions, including our own university, to immediately transition from face-to-face in-person learning to completely online lessons. The abrupt switch to fully online learning has been particularly stressful for many instructors and students who prefer in-person instruction. Online learning is often stigmatized as a weaker option that provides a lower quality education than in-person face-to-face learning (Hodges et al.
2020
). Indeed, such negative attitudes to fully online learning were revealed by a large EDUCAUSE survey (Pomerantz and Brooks
2017
). The survey of 11,141 faculty members from 131 U.S. institutions found that only 9% of faculty prefer to teach a fully online course. In other words, a whopping 91% of faculty do not wish to teach in a completely online environment. Students’ opinions of fully online courses are not much better; a recent student survey by EDUCAUSE of more than 40,000 students across 118 American universities revealed that as many as 70% of the respondents mostly or completely prefer face-to-face learning environments (Gierdowski
2019
).
Clearly, many faculty members and students do not see the value of fully online learning, despite the fact that online learning has been around for many decades. During the current health crisis, many instructors have had to improvise quick online learning solutions (Hodges et al.
2020
). For example, in our own university, there are anecdotal reports of a myriad of emergency online methods. Some instructors, for example, merely uploaded their PowerPoint slides or papers onto a learning management system such as Moodle and asked students to read them on their own. Any questions were asked asynchronously on the Moodle forum. Other instructors recorded their own lectures (usually at least one hour long) and asked students to asynchronously watch the video lectures and then ask individual questions later. Still others talked for more than two hours via synchronous video platforms watched by students in their own homes. Although these online methods may be an efficient method of delivering content, they are not particularly effective in promoting active learning and interest (Bates and Galloway
2012
). As one student remarked, “Sitting in front of my computer to watch a 2-h live lecture without any active learning activities such as group work is pretty boring!” Indeed, without any active learning activities such as peer interaction, a fully online course will feel more like an interactive book than a classroom (Sutterlin
2018
).
Well-planned active online learning lessons are markedly different from the emergency online teaching offered in response to a crisis (Hodges et al.
2020
). One promising strategy for promoting online active learning is the
fully online flipped classroom
pedagogical approach, hereafter referred to as the online flipped classroom approach. An online flipped classroom is a variant of the conventional flipped model. A conventional flipped classroom model consists of online learning of basic concepts before class, followed by face-to-face learning activities (Bishop and Verleger
2013
). The conventional flipped model has become very popular in recent years due to its association with active learning, which emphasizes students’ active learning (Xiu and Thompson
2020
). Active learning activities such as peer discussions can help students construct better understandings of the subject material (Deslauriers et al.
2019
). Recent meta-analyses have provided consistent overall support for the superiority of the conventional flipped classroom approach over traditional learning for enhancing student learning (e.g., Låg and Sæle
2019
; Lo and Hew
2019
; Shi et al.
2019
; van Alten et al.
2019
).
The online flipped classroom is similar to the conventional flipped classroom model in that students are encouraged to prepare for class by completing some pre-class activities (e.g., watching video lectures, completing quizzes). However, unlike the conventional flipped classroom approach, students in online flipped classrooms do not meet face-to-face, but online (Stohr et al.
2020
). Although the online flipped classroom appears to be gathering momentum in higher education, very few studies have examined its effectiveness (for an exception, see Stohr et al.
2020
, who compared the online flipped classroom format with a conventional non-flipped teaching format). So far, we are not cognizant of any research that evaluated the efficacy of the fully online flipped classroom relative to the conventional flipped classroom. Establishing the effectiveness of online flipped classrooms is important, as practitioners need to know whether this active learning approach can be used during prolonged school closures.
Against this backdrop, this study compares the effects of online flipped classrooms versus conventional flipped classrooms on student learning outcomes. To this end, two conventional flipped classes in the Faculty of Education are transformed into online flipped classrooms. Students in both the online and flipped classes participated in the online pre-class activity asynchronously using a learning management system. However, students in the online flipped classes joined the online in-class learning synchronously using a video conferencing app whereas their counterparts in the conventional flipped classes attended face-to-face classes. The online flipped courses were designed using the 5E conceptual framework and used a cloud-based video conferencing app. We used the Zoom application after careful consideration of many different videoconferencing platforms. Our reasons for doing so are given in the Section of “Stage Two: Transforming conventional flipped classes into online flipped classes”.
The 5E framework consists of five phases—Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate (Bybee et al.
2006
).
Engage—The first phase aims to engage students in the learning process. Methods to engage students usually include using a real-world scenario, or problem, asking students questions that allow them to brainstorm or think critically, and helping them to create connections to their past experiences.
Explore—In the exploration phase, the teacher, who works as a facilitator or coach, gives the students time and opportunity to explore the content and construct their own understanding of the topic at hand.
Explain—This phase starts with students attempting to explain specific aspects of the engagement and exploration experiences. Based on these explanations, the teacher introduces terminology in a direct and explicit manner to facilitate concept building.
Elaborate—In this phase, the teacher provided more detailed information about the subject content through the use of mini lectures and/or whole class discussions. Students are also given the opportunity to apply what they have learned and receive feedback from the teacher and their peers.
Evaluate—Formative assessments (e.g., quizzes) can be used to evaluate students’ mastery of the subject material at the beginning and throughout the 5E phases, and teachers can complete a summative assessment after the elaboration phase (e.g., final exams).
We adopted the 5E framework for the following reasons. First, the 5E framework, which is based on various educational theories and models (e.g., Herbart’s instructional model, Dewey’s instructional model, Atkin-Karplus Learning Cycle) (Bybee et al.
2006
), provides a sound instructional sequence for designing a course and planning activities. The 5E framework can help instructors organize and integrate both the in-class and out-of-class learning activities (Lo
2017
).
Second, previous research has shown the positive effect of the 5E framework on student achievement. These positive effects were initially established in science education (e.g., Akar
2005
; Boddy et al.
2003
). Recently, the 5E model has yielded positive results when applied to various subject areas and when used to design inquiry- and interaction-based learning activities. Mullins (
2017
), for example, found that undergraduate students in a 5E-supported class outperformed their peers in a traditional lecture setting. Hew et al. (
2018
) designed two postgraduate courses based on the 5E model in order to foster students’ active learning. Ninety-two percent of the participants agreed that the 5E supported courses were more engaging than traditional classroom instruction.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. First, we describe our study design and methodology. This is followed by a description of our two stages of research. In Stage One, we explain how we use the 5E framework to design our two conventional flipped classes; In Stage Two, we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes, using a cloud-based video conferencing app. We describe the various pedagogical practices that Zoom videoconferencing can facilitate before and during online flipped classes. In this paper, we use the term “pedagogical practices” to refer to specific activities that are used to structure teaching and learning. This study is guided by the following two questions.
Research question 1:
What effect does the change from a conventional flipped classroom format to an online flipped format have on student learning performance?
Research question 2:
What are the good practices for videoconferencing
-
assisted online flipped classrooms, as perceived by students and/or teaching staff?
Method
This study was conducted in a large public Asian university. Four classes were involved: (a) conventional flipped Course 1, (b) conventional flipped Course 2, (c) online flipped Course 1, and (d) online flipped Course 2. Conventional flipped Courses 1 and 2 were the
control
group. Online flipped Courses 1 and 2 were the
experimental
group. To avoid any potential instructor confounding bias, the same professor and teaching assistants (TAs) taught the conventional and online flipped formats of each class. Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Hong Kong and consent forms from all participants in the study were collected.
Data collection and analysis
To reiterate, this study had two purposes: (a) to determine the effect of an online flipped classroom on student learning performance as determined by student final course marks, and (b) to determine good practices for videoconferencing
-
assisted online flipped classrooms, as perceived by the participants (students and teaching staff). We adopted a mixed methods involving quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a deeper understanding of the research problem (Ivankova et al.
2006
).
The data collection spanned across two semesters, which corresponded to the aforementioned two stages of the research. The conventional flipped classes were implemented in conventional flipped Courses 1 and 2 during the semester of 2019 Fall before the pandemic (Stage One). Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, all courses were required to be delivered online in our university in the 2020 Spring semester. Therefore, the online flipped classes were conducted in online flipped Courses 1 and 2 during the pandemic in 2020 Spring (Stage Two). Students’ knowledge and skills of the course content were checked at the beginning of the each course. Students final course marks in each course were collected and used as measure of the student learning outcomes at the end of the semester (See Fig.
1
for the research timeline).

To address the first purpose, we compared the students’ final course marks in the online flipped classrooms and conventional flipped classrooms. Quantitative data from 99 students were collected (see Table
1
). We used the students’ final course marks to measure performance.

To identify the perceived good practices for videoconferencing
-
assisted online flipped classrooms, we invited students and the teaching staff to complete a self-reflection exercise based on the following question: “What do you perceive as good practices in a videoconferencing-supported online flipped classroom?” The qualitative data collected from students and instructors were analyzed as follows. The first step was an initial reading of all of the response data to obtain an overall impression. The first author then applied the grounded approach (Strauss and Corbin
1990
) to the qualitative data to generate relevant codes. Similar codes were organized into themes. In order to increase the consistency of coding, several exemplary quotes that clearly illustrated each constructed theme were identified. We also allowed new themes (if any) to emerge inductively during the coding process. The second author coded the data. There was perfect agreement with the coding. Table

summarizes how the data for each research question were collected and analyzed.

Stage one: designing conventional flipped classes using the 5E framework
In this section, we first describe how we use the 5E framework to design our two conventional flipped classes (Course 1:
E-Learning Strategies
, and Course 2:
Engaging Adult Learners
). In the next section, we describe how we transform these two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes. Figure

shows the 5E framework that guided our design of the conventional flipped classes. Table

Conventional flipped course 1: E-learning strategies
This course discussed the various e-learning strategies that can be employed to foster six types of learning, including problem-solving, attitude learning, factual learning, concept learning, procedural learning, and principle learning. There were eight sessions in the course. The first seven sessions were flipped—each consisting of an online pre-class learning component and a 3-h face-to-face in-class component. The last session was devoted to students’ presentations. Figure
3
shows an example of how the 5E framework was used in Course 1.
Fig. 3
Example of a pre-class activity in Course 1
Full size image
For instance, in the pre-class phase of
Session 2: Instructional Design—Part 1
, we posted a video that posed the question “What do we mean by ‘understand’”. This video
engaged
students’ curiosity about the importance of writing clear and measurable learning objectives. The instructor in the video highlighted the pitfalls of using vague words such as “know” and “understand” when writing learning objectives. Students then
explored
and
explained
their own individual learning objectives using the ABCD model (audience, behavior, condition, degree). Students were able to use a mobile instant messaging (MIM) app such as WeChat to ask questions of their peers or instructor. When a message arrived, a notification appeared on the receiver’s phone screen, encouraging timely feedback and frequent interaction (Rosenfeld et al.
2018
).
During the face-to-face in-class session, the instructor re-engaged students’ attention by discussing basic instructional design issues such as “How do we write good lesson objectives?” The instructor conducted short debriefing sessions to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of students’ pre-class work. The instructor also facilitated class or small group discussions to build students’ understanding of how to write measurable lesson objectives that help students to achieve specific learning outcomes (e.g., factual learning). These discussions allowed students to
elaborate
on good lesson objectives practices. To
evaluate
the students’ understanding, the instructor asked them to work in groups of four on an instructional design scenario (e.g., teaching participants how to deal with angry customers), and then write a learning objective for the lesson in an online forum; their peers then commented on the posted learning objectives (Fig.
4
).

Conventional flipped course 2: engaging adult learners
This course discussed the key principles of adult learning, as well as strategies used in adult education (e.g., transformational learning theory). There were eight sessions in the course, each session lasted three hours. An example of how the 5E instructional model was used is shown in Fig.
5
.
Fig. 5
Example of a pre-class activity in Course 2
Full size image
For example, in the pre-class session for
Session 3: Motivation,
we uploaded a four-minute video that briefly described the concepts of reinforcement and punishment. The aim of the video was to
engage
students’ attention on the focal topic. To help students
explore
the topic in further, they were asked to respond to the following question: “After watching the video, can you think of other positive reinforcers, negative reinforcers, and punishment methods?” Students posted their opinions (
explained
) on a discussion forum. Students also used the WeChat app to ask questions of their peers or instructor.
During the subsequent face-to-face lesson (Fig.
6
), the instructor facilitated whole class discussions using relevant questions to
elaborate
on the topics covered in the pre-class video. An example of a question used was ‘When should we employ positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, or punishment?’ Based on the students’ responses, the instructor was able to provide more in-depth explanation of the subject matter, or correct any student misunderstanding. This will help enhance students’ comprehension of the subject content. The instructor also discussed the notion of intrinsic motivation (e.g., the self-determination theory). In addition to elaborating on the content, the instructor also
evaluated
the students’ understanding by asking students to complete small group discussion activities. An example of a small group discussion activity was ‘Did you have any experience where you did not like learning a subject or doing an activity? How would you motivate yourself in that situation? Please try to use a mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation factors.’ Upon completion of the small group activity, students from each group presented their views to the whole class. The instructor, as well as the rest of the classmates provided feedback.

Stage two: transforming conventional flipped classes into online flipped classes
The outbreak of COVID-19 inspired us to transform the two conventional flipped classes discussed above into fully online flipped classes. After careful consideration, the Zoom videoconferencing app was used for the synchronized online meetings (see Table
4
). The whole transformation process took about one week with the bulk of the time was spent on exploring and testing the features of Zoom.
Table 4 Phases of the 5E framework and examples of activities in the online flipped classroom
Full size table
Zoom is a Web videoconferencing service that allows users to communicate online with individuals in real time via computer, tablet, or mobile device. We chose Zoom because of its ease of use (Kim
2017
; Sutterlin
2018
), its lower bandwidth requirements (Sutterlin
2018
), and its ability to record and store sessions without recourse to third-party software (Archibald et al.
2019
). More importantly, Zoom was chosen because its functions could easily support the implementation of our online flipped classroom. For instance, it allows instructors to easily create breakout rooms for group discussions. It also makes team-teaching possible by allowing more than one host and giving all of the hosts administrative capabilities such as sharing screens and remote control over shared screens (Johnston
2020
).
To keep our online meetings secure, we activated the “
only authenticated users can join
” option. Specifically, we only allowed participants using our own university’s email domain to join the online meetings. In addition, we enabled the “
waiting room
” feature so that we could screen all of participants in the “
waiting room
” and admit only students officially enrolled in our classes into the online meeting. After all of the participants had entered, we then locked the meeting using the “
Lock the meeting
” feature. Once we had locked a meeting, no new participants could join.
The same learning materials used in the conventional flipped classes were used in the online flipped classes. Table
4
shows some of the teaching and learning activities. Students in the online flipped classes completed pre-class activities that were similar to those used in the conventional flipped classes, but these were not followed by face-to-face meetings, but by online meetings conducted on the Zoom videoconferencing app.
Online flipped course 1: E-learning strategies
Like the conventional flipped course, the online flipped Course 1 consisted of eight sessions. The first seven sessions were flipped—students were encouraged to complete a set of pre-class sessions asynchronously (similar to Fig.
3
). Students also used the WeChat MIM app to ask questions of their peers or instructors. However, unlike the conventional flipped approach, the “in-class” session for the online flipped students was conducted completely online through Zoom videoconferencing. In the final session (Session 8), the online flipped students also presented their work on Zoom. Each online “in-class” session lasted three hours—similar in duration to the in-class component of the conventional flipped format.
In the online synchronous “in-class” sessions, the instructor started by reminding students to switch on their webcams and to mute their microphones when not speaking. Next, the instructor lead a short class debriefing session to
elaborate
on the materials covered in the pre-class session. This was similar to the structure of the conventional flipped class format. For example, the instructor might discuss the students’ completed pre-class work and highlight the overall strengths and weaknesses. The main purpose of these short debriefing sessions was to clarify students’ initial doubts or misconceptions. Following the debriefing sessions, the instructor facilitated class discussions that delved deeper into the subject content. To
evaluate
students’ understanding of the materials, students were asked to work individually or participate in small group discussions on specific questions similar to those used in the conventional flipped classes. Students then presented their work online to the whole class, and received peer and instructor feedback.
To engage the participants, the instructor used a number of features of the Zoom videoconferencing system. For example, the instructor posed questions during the whole class discussion and used the polling feature to rapidly collect and analyze student responses. The polling feature provided a function similar to a clicker or student response system. Based on the poll results, the instructor then addressed students’ misunderstandings. To enable small group discussions, the instructor used the breakout rooms feature of Zoom
.
Each student was assigned to one of several groups. Each group consisted of four to five students. Other students could not “drop” into other groups, but the instructor could drop into any group and participate in the discussions. When it was time for the small groups to return to the whole class, students would receive a time indicator reminding them that they were rejoining the whole class. Table
5
shows how the specific features of Zoom helped support the online “in-class” teaching and learning activities. Figure

illustrates some of the Zoom features used in the course.

Online flipped course 2: engaging adult learners
Similar to the conventional flipped course, the online flipped course had eight sessions. The pre-class and in-class activities used in the conventional flipped course were also used in the online flipped course (see Fig.
5
for an example of a pre-class activity). Students also used the WeChat MIM app to ask questions of their peers or instructors. The last three sessions were used for students’ online presentations via videoconferencing. Each online “in-class” session lasted three hours—similar in duration to the in-class component of the conventional flipped class. In the online synchronous “in-class” sessions, the instructor reminded students to switch on their webcams and to mute their microphones when not speaking. The instructor used the features of the Zoom videoconferencing system shown in Table
5
and Fig.

.
Results and discussion
Research question 1:
What effect does the change from a conventional flipped classroom format to an online flipped format have on student learning performance?
Conventional flipped versus online flipped course 1: E-learning strategies
To address Research Question 1, the learning outcomes of students in the conventional flipped Course 1 and the online flipped Course 1 were measured and compared. The main purpose of both courses was to teach students the skills needed to create an e-learning storyboard and to develop a fully online course based on the 5E framework on Moodle. At the beginning of both the conventional flipped and online flipped classes, students were surveyed if they had any experience creating storyboards or fully online courses. None of the students had any such prior experience. Therefore, we assumed that both groups of students had similar levels of prior knowledge/skill. Next, we used both groups of students’ final course marks as a measure of the student learning outcomes. The maximum final marks in the final assessment was 100.
We first checked the normality of the final course marks data. If there were a significant deviation from normality, the Mann–Whitney U would be the most appropriate test for comparing the groups; otherwise, an independent samples
t
-test would be appropriate. The results showed that the course marks for both the conventional flipped (
W
(23) = 0.920,
p
= 0.068) and online flipped classes (
W
(26) = 0.964,
p
= 0.479) were normally distributed, as assessed by the Shapiro–Wilk’s test. There was also homogeneity in the variances for the course marks, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (
p
= 0.652). In addition, there were no outliers in the data, as assessed by an inspection of the boxplots (Fig.
8
).

An independent-samples
t
-test was therefore conducted to determine if there were differences in the final marks of the conventional flipped and online flipped classes. The results suggested that online flipped participants (
M
= 66.00, SD = 11.63) performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning format (
M
= 65.04, SD = 11.80),
t
(47) = 0.285,
p
= 0.777.
Conventional flipped versus online flipped course 2: engaging adult learners
The main purpose of both the conventional flipped and online flipped
Engaging Adult Learners
courses was to introduce students to the key characteristics of adult learners, the key principles of adult learning, and strategies for adult education. First, to test if there were any initial differences in students’ prior knowledge of the course content, a short quiz was administered to both groups at the start of the semester. The Mann–Whitney
U
test found no significant initial differences between the conventional flipped group (
Mdn
= 0) and the online flipped group (
Mdn
= 0.5),
U
= 218.5,
p
= 0.06.
Next, we used the students’ final course marks as a measure of the student learning outcomes. The final assessment included individual written reflections on course topics and relevant articles, and a group demonstration of an adult-teaching strategy. The maximum final marks for the final assessment was 100. As in the above analysis, we first checked the normality of the final course mark data. The course marks for both the conventional flipped and online flipped classes were normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro–Wilk’s test:
W
(25) = 0.963,
p
= 0.470 for the conventional flipped course and
W
(24) = 0.930,
p
= 0.096 for the online flipped course. There was also a homogeneity of variances, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (
p
= 0.304). In addition, there were no outliers in the data, as assessed by an inspection of the boxplots (Fig.
9
).
Fig. 9

Full size image
We subsequently carried out an independent-samples t-test to examine if there was any significant difference in the final course marks of the conventional flipped and online flipped classes. The results suggested that online flipped learning participants (
M
= 83.25, SD = 4.56) performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning classes (
M
= 83.40, SD = 5.51),
t
(47) = 0.104,
p
= 0.918.
Research question 2:
What are the good practices for videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms, as perceived by students and/or teaching staff?
The analyses of the participants’ comments identified the following seven good practices for videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms.
(1)
Remind participants to mute their microphones when not speaking to eliminate undesirable background noise
. According to Gazzillo (
2018
), muting participants’ microphones allows the speaker to have center stage while eliminating the distraction of audio feedback. As one teaching staff member said,
.
It’s a good practice at the beginning to mute all of the participants by selecting the “Mute All” button at the bottom of the participants panel. This will eliminate all background noise (e.g., television sounds, audio feedback). I will then ask the participants to turn their audio back on if they wish to talk
In terms of Zoom functionality, by pressing and holding the “space bar” allows the participants to temporarily switch on their microphone. We also ask the participants to install an AI-enabled application called “Krisp” to minimize the background noise of the participants.
(2)
Remind participants before the online “in-class” session begins to switch on their webcams
. Webcams show a person’s face to other people on the video call, which can help to increase online social presence among classmates (Conrad and Donaldson
2011
). Online social presence is positively correlated with student satisfaction and student perceived learning (Richardson et al.
2017
). The participants also strongly prefer to see a face during instruction as it is perceived as more educational (Kizilcec et al.
2014
). Students’ facial expressions are also a valuable source of feedback for the instructor to know whether the students could understand the subject matter (Sathik and Jonathan
2013
). An instructor can use students’ facial expressions to determine whether to speed up, or slow down, or provide further elaborations. Feedback from the teaching staff included the following comments.
It is important to ask students to turn on their cameras. Students will be more focused and interactive and teaching will be better when teachers can see students’ responses.
As an instructor, I do not feel as if I’m talking to a wall when I can see some actual faces. Students also feel they are talking to someone rather than to an empty black screen. But it’s important to inform the students in advance to switch on their webcams so that they can do their hair properly or put on makeup beforehand—this was what some students actually told me!
During teaching, seeing your students' faces will give you another form of feedback. For example, when they look confused or nod their heads, it allows me to fine-tune the delivery of the content. These reactions give me visual feedback on whether I need further explanations or examples to elaborate on the topic.
Feedback from the students included the following comments.
Showing our faces is really helpful as we can see our classmates’ faces and remember them. Also, it makes the class more alive because we can see their expressions. Showing our faces is very helpful! It can make me feel like I’m in a real class! I enjoy the feeling of having a class with my classmates.
Turning on the camera helps us be more attentive in the online class.
To avoid showing any undesirable background objects (e.g., a messy bedroom) during the video meeting, participants can choose to replace their actual background with a virtual background. The participants can easily do this using the Zoom virtual background feature.
(3)
Manage the transition to the online flipped classroom approach for students
. Not every student will be familiar with the videoconferencing app or the flipped classroom approach. Therefore, to promote student buy-in of this new pedagogical approach, it is important for the staff to directly address two main issues: (a) the structure and activities of the online flipped course, and (b) the functions of the video conferencing app. Feedback from the students included the following comments.
If teachers would like to use some functions in Zoom, they need to first help students get familiar with it. A brief introduction to Zoom at the beginning of the class is helpful.
First, I informed the students that these two courses would have two components: a pre-class session and an online “in-class” session. This helped students understand the flipped approach better. Next, my teaching assistant and I conducted a short introduction to using Zoom online before the class began. This helped students get familiar with the features we would be using in Zoom.
Constant fine-tuning is also a key element in managing the transition to the online flipped classroom. Asking the students what works and what doesn’t have become our practice every after the lesson. These comments allow us to rethink and re-plan for the next online synchronous session.
Feedback from the teaching staff included the following comments.
Having a technical-related orientation session before the actual class starts helps a lot for students who are not familiar with the videoconferencing tool.
(4)
Instructors should use dual monitors to simulate, as close as possible, the look and feel of a face-to-face class—one monitor to view all the participants in “gallery view,” and the other to view the presentation material
. It is very useful for instructors and teaching assistants to use the dual-monitor display function, which allows the video layout and screen share content to be presented on two separate monitors. One monitor can be used to view the participants (up to 49) in “gallery view,” and the other to display the presentation materials. In the “gallery view,” the instructor can see thumbnail displays of all of the participants in a grid pattern that expands and contracts automatically as participants join and leave the meeting (Zoom Video Communications
2019
). The use of a dual monitor feature is also useful for PowerPoint presentations and hiding notes from the participants. Feedback from the teaching staff included:
During the preparation for this course, we would like to simulate, as close as possible, the look and feel of a face-to-face class. This thinking brought us to the dual monitor layout for our Zoom sessions. The first monitor is for the teaching assistant; in this case, it acts as a co-host for the Zoom session. The teaching assistant extends the computer screen to a monitor to show the participants’ faces or the “gallery view.” This monitor acts as a “classroom” in the traditional face-to-face class. During the session, this first monitor also serves as a tool for classroom management. This view is where the “chat” and “raise hand” functions can be seen. The second monitor is where the instructor places the presentation materials. This view acts as the projector in the traditional face-to-face class. Occasionally, we added a third screen, which is an iPad to do real-time annotation. This iPad can is a replacement of the conventional “whiteboard” in a face-to-face class.
(5)
Activate and evaluate students’ pre-class learning with a short review.
At the beginning of the online “in-class” sessions, instructors should use short formative assessment methods (e.g., a quiz) to activate and evaluate students’ understanding of the pre-class activities. The activation of prior learning enhances student learning because it is the foundation for the new material presented in the classroom (Merrill
2002
). Indeed, recent meta-analyses have suggested that flipped learning is more effective when formative assessments (e.g., quizzes or reviews) are used before and/or during class time (e.g., Hew and Lo
2018
; Låg and Sæle
2019
; Lo et al.
2017
; van Alten et al.
2019
). Students in this study reported positive benefits of using short formative assessments such as reviews or quizzes. Examples of student feedback include the following comments.
I find the reviews at the beginning of the “in-class” sessions very helpful! It’s good to start from something we are familiar with, and then go to the new materials. The reviewing of pre-class work is great because we can know what points we do not understand well and how we can improve.
The reviews helped me understand the issue more deeply. I could find out what my misunderstandings of the content are.
I find the teachers’ explanation and review of the pre-class work helpful.
(6)
Use an MIM app on mobile phones to foster quicker online response times and to communicate with students during their online breakout sessions
. Although students can ask questions via discussion forums or email, the asynchronicity of these apps creates a time lag between postings and replies which can discourage students from communicating with each other (Hew et al.
2018
). In contrast, MIM apps such as WhatsApp and WeChat allow users to engage in quasi synchronous communications on their mobile phones. When communication needs are urgent, many students may only have their phones available. As soon as an MIM message is sent, a notification automatically shows up on the user’s phone screen, which encourages timely response (Hew et al.
2018
; Rosenfeld et al.
2018
). In addition, MIM is more popular than voice calls, emails, and even face-to-face communication among young people (Lenhart et al.
2010
). As of March 2019, more than 41 million mobile instant messages are sent every minute (Clement
2019
). Student feedback on using MIM in classrooms included the following comments.
I like using MIM such as WeChat because it allows us to communicate with other people immediately.
I enjoy using WeChat to ask questions and get immediate feedback from my classmates and teaching staff.

Use a variety of presentation media as well as a variety of activities to sustain student interest
. No matter how interested a learner is in the topic of a presentation or discussion, that interest will wane in the face of monotony (Driscoll
2000
). Therefore, it is recommended that instructors sustain student interest by varying the use of presentation media. Instructors, for example, can alternate the use of PowerPoint slides with digital handwriting on an iPad. The instructor in this study made the following comments.
I find continual use of PowerPoint slides to be boring. It’s always the same style: a bullet list of information with some animations or pictures. I find it useful to sustain my students’ attention by writing on an iPad.
Comments from the students were also positive.
I find the instructor writing on an iPad helps to focus my attention better than PowerPoint slides.
Writing on the iPad is like writing on a whiteboard in real face-to-face classrooms. It helps me develop a better understanding of the topic.
Digital writing on an iPad can help learners see the progressive development of the subject content (Hulls
2005
), and follow the instructor’s cognitive process better than pre-prepared PowerPoint presentations (Lee and Lim
2013
). Writing on an iPad can also enable an instructor to immediately adjust his or her instruction in response to the students’ needs. Using digital writing can significantly improve students’ understanding of conceptual knowledge when compared to PowerPoint-based presentation lectures (Lee and Lim
2013
).
In addition to varying the presentation media, an instructor should also use different activities, including guest speakers, during the online class session. Feedback from the students included the following comments.
The use of different functions in Zoom, such as breakout rooms for group activities, voting, and raising hands, is useful because they help us to be involved. It helps increase the learner-learner and learner-instructor interaction, which may be lacking in a fully online class.
During the three-hour online class, we had not only the teacher’s explanations, but also had a guest speaker and online group discussions via breakout rooms, which made the class engaging.
In this study, the instructor invited a United Kingdom-based practicing instructional designer as a guest speaker in the two online flipped courses to talk about her experience in developing e-learning courses and engaging adult learners. Guest speakers enhance students’ educational experience by giving them real-world knowledge (Metrejean and Zarzeski
2001
). Guest speakers can offer students a different point of view, one that students may better understand. Guest speakers can also alleviate the monotony of listening to a single instructor.
Conclusion
Amidst the burgeoning use of online learning during the unpredictable present, this study evaluates the efficacy of a videoconferencing
-
supported fully online flipped classroom. It compares student outcomes in four higher education classes: conventional flipped Course 1 versus online flipped Course 1, and conventional flipped Course 2 versus online flipped Course 2. Overall, this study makes three contributions to the literature on flipped classrooms. First, it provides a thick description of the development of the conventional flipped classroom approach based on the 5E framework, and the transformation of the conventional flipped classroom into a fully online flipped classroom. A thick description of the development of the flipped classrooms is provided to encourage replication by other researchers and practitioners. Second, our findings reveal that the online flipped classroom approach can be as effective as the conventional flipped classroom. Third, we identify seven good practices for using videoconferencing to support online flipped classrooms. This set of good practices can provide useful guidelines for other instructors who might be interested in implementing an online flipped approach.
One potential limitation of our study is that it was relatively short in duration (8 weeks). However, according to Fraenkel et al. (
2014
), some researchers do collect data within a fairly short time. A short-term data collection period enables researchers to collect and analyze data to see if an intervention is workable before committing to a longer study (Creswell
2015
). We therefore urge future researchers to examine the use of videoconferencing
-
supported online flipped classrooms over a longer period of time, such as one year or more, to verify the results of this study.
Another interesting area for future work will be examining how instructors can support learners’ self-regulation during online flipped classroom (Cheng et al.
2019
), as well as what strategies can best motivate students to complete the pre-class work.

Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer effective support for online learning and teaching, including personalizing learning for students, automating instructors’ routine tasks, and powering adaptive assessments. However, while the opportunities for AI are promising, the impact of AI systems on the culture of, norms in, and expectations about interactions between students and instructors are still elusive. In online learning, learner–instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) has a profound impact on students’ satisfaction and learning outcomes. Thus, identifying how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on their interaction is important to identify any gaps, challenges, or barriers preventing AI systems from achieving their intended potential and risking the safety of these interactions. To address this need for forward-looking decisions, we used Speed Dating with storyboards to analyze the authentic voices of 12 students and 11 instructors on diverse use cases of possible AI systems in online learning. Findings show that participants envision adopting AI systems in online learning can enable personalized learner–instructor interaction at scale but at the risk of violating social boundaries. Although AI systems have been positively recognized for improving the quantity and quality of communication, for providing just-in-time, personalized support for large-scale settings, and for improving the feeling of connection, there were concerns about responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues. These findings have implications for the design of AI systems to ensure explainability, human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation. Overall, contributions of this study include the design of AI system storyboards which are technically feasible and positively support learner–instructor interaction, capturing students’ and instructors’ concerns of AI systems through Speed Dating, and suggesting practical implications for maximizing the positive impact of AI systems while minimizing the negative ones.
Introduction
The opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI) in online learning and teaching are broad (Anderson et al.,
1985
; Baker,
2016
; Roll et al.,
2018
; Seo et al.,
2020b
; VanLehn,
2011
), ranging from personalized learning for students and automation of instructors’ routine tasks to AI-powered assessments (Popenici & Kerr,
2017
). For example, AI tutoring systems can provide personalized guidance, support, or feedback by tailoring learning content based on student-specific learning patterns or knowledge levels (Hwang et al.,
2020
). AI teaching assistants help instructors save time answering students’ simple, repetitive questions in online discussion forums, and instead instructors can dedicate their saved time to higher-value work (Goel & Polepeddi,
2016
). AI analytics allows instructors to understand students’ performance, progress, and potential by decrypting their clickstream data (Roll & Winne,
2015
; Fong et al.,
2019
; Seo et al.,
2021
; Holstein et al.,
2018
).
While the opportunities for AI are promising, students and instructors may perceive the impact of AI systems negatively. For instance, students may perceive indiscriminate collection and analysis of their data through AI systems as a privacy breach, as illustrated by the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal (Chan,
2019
; Luckin,
2017
). The behavior of AI agents that do not take into account the risk of data bias or algorithmic bias can be perceived by students as discriminatory (Crawford & Calo,
2016
; Murphy,
2019
). Instructors worry that relying too much on AI systems might compromise the student’s ability to learn independently, solve problems creatively, and think critically (Wogu et al.,
2018
). It is important to examine how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems in online learning environments (Cruz-Benito et al.,
2019
).
The AI in Education (AIEd) community is increasingly exploring the impact of AI systems in online education. For example, Roll and Wylie (
2016
) call for more involvement of AI systems in the communication between students and instructors, and in education applications outside school context. At the same time, Zawacki-Richter and his colleagues (
2019
) conducted a systematic review of AIEd publications from 2007 to 2018 and as a result found a lack of critical reflection of the ethical impact and risks of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction. Popenici and Kerr (
2017
) investigated the impact of AI systems on learning and teaching, and uncovered potential conflicts between students and instructors, such as privacy concerns, changes in power structures, and excessive control. All of these studies called for more research into the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction, which will help us identify any gaps, issues, or barriers preventing AI systems from achieving their intended potential.
Indeed, learner–instructor interaction plays a crucial role in online learning. Kang and Im (
2013
) demonstrated that factors of learner–instructor interaction, such as communication, support, and presence, improve students’ satisfaction and learning outcomes. The learner–instructor interaction further affects students’ self-esteem, motivation to learn, and confidence in facing new challenges (Laura & Chapman,
2009
). Less is known, however, about how introducing AI systems in online learning will affect learner–instructor interaction. Guilherme (
2019
, p. 7) predicted that AI systems would have “a deep impact in the classroom, changing the relationship between teacher and student.” More work is needed to understand how and why various forms of AI systems affect learner–instructor interaction in online learning (Felix,
2020
).
Considering the findings in the literature and the areas for further research, the present study aimed to identify how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction in online learning. To this end, we used Speed Dating, a design method that allows participants to quickly interact with and experience the concepts and contextual dimensions of multiple AI systems without any technical implementation (Davidoff et al.,
2007
). In Speed Dating, participants are presented with various hypothetical scenarios via storyboards while researchers conduct interviews to understand the participants’ immediate reactions (Zimmerman & Forlizzi,
2017
). These interviews provided rich opportunities to understand the way students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction and the boundaries beyond which AI systems are perceived as “invasive.”
The study offers several unique contributions. First, as part of the method, we designed storyboards that can be used to facilitate further research on AI implications for online learning. Second, the study documents the main promises and concerns of AI in online learning, as perceived by both students and instructors in higher education. Last, we identify practical implications for the design of AI-based systems in online learning. These include empahses on explainability, human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation.
This paper is organized as follows. The next section provides the theoretical framework and background behind this research paper by describing the main aspects of the learner–instructor interaction and AI systems in education. “

Background
This paper explores the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction in online learning. We first proposed a theoretical framework based on studies on learner–instructor interaction in online learning. We then reviewed the AI systems currently in use in online learning environments.
Theoretical framework
Interaction is paramount for successful online learning (Banna et al.,
2015
; Nguyen et al.,
2018
). Students exchange information and knowledge through interaction and construct new knowledge from this process (Jou et al.,
2016
). Moore (
1989
) classified these interactions in online learning into three types: learner–content, learner–learner, and learner–instructor. These interactions help students become active and more engaged in their online courses (Seo et al.,
2021
; Martin et al.,
2018
), and by doing so strengthen their sense of community which is essential for the continuous usage of online learning platforms (Luo et al.,
2017
).
Martin and Bolliger (
2018
) found that the learner–instructor interaction is the most important among Moore’s three types of interactions. Instructors can improve student engagement and learning by providing a variety of communication channels, support, encouragement, and timely feedback (Martin et al.,
2018
). Instructors can also enhance students’ sense of community by engaging and guiding online discussions (Shackelford & Maxwell,
2012
; Zhang et al.,
2018
). Collectively, learner–instructor interaction has a significant impact on students’ satisfaction and achievement in online learning (Andersen,
2013
; Kang & Im,
2013
; Walker,
2016
).
The five-factor model of learner–instructor interaction offers a useful lens for interpreting interactions between students and the instructor in online learning (see Table
1
; Kang,
2010
). Robinson et al. (
2017
) found that communication and support are key factors of the learner–instructor interaction for designing meaningful online collaborative learning. Richardson et al. (
2017
) added that the perceived presence during learner–instructor interaction positively influences student motivation, satisfaction, learning, and retention in online courses. Kang and Im (
2013
) synthesized these findings by showing that communication, support, and presence are the three most important factors in improving students’ achievement and satisfaction over other factors. Thus, in this study, we focused on communication, support, and presence between students and instructors.

Full size table
AI systems are likely to affect the way learner–instructor interaction occurs in online learning environments (Guilherme,
2019
). If students and instructors have strong concerns about the impact of AI systems on their interactions, then they would not use such systems, in spite of perceived benefits (Felix,
2020
). To the best of our knowledge, the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction has limited empirical studies, and Misiejuk and Wasson (
2017
) have called for more work on this.

There are a variety of AI systems that are expected to affect learner–instructor interaction in online learning. For example, Goel and Polepeddi (
2016
) developed an AI teaching assistant named Jill Watson to augment the instructor’s communication with students by autonomously responding to student introductions, posting weekly announcements, and answering routine, frequently asked questions. Perin and Lauterbach (
2018
) developed an AI scoring system that allows faster communication of grades between students and the instructor. Luckin (
2017
) showed AI systems that support both students and instructors by providing constant feedback on how students learn and the progress they are making towards their learning goals. Ross et al. (
2018
) developed online adaptive quizzes to support students by providing learning contents tailored to each student’s individual needs, which improved student motivation and engagement. Heidicker et al. (
2017
) showed that virtual avatars allow several physically separated users to collaborate in an immersive virtual environment by increasing sense of presence. Aslan and her colleagues (
2019
) developed AI facial analytics to improve instructors’ presence as a coach in technology-mediated learning environments. When looking at these AI systems, in-depth insight into how students and instructors perceive the AI’s impact is important (Zawacki-Richter et al.,
2019
).
The recent introduction of commercial AI systems for online learning has demonstrated the complex impact of AI on learner–instructor interaction. For instance, Proctorio (Proctorio Inc., USA), a system that aims to prevent cheating by monitoring students and their computer screens during an exam, seems like a fool-proof plan to monitor students in online learning, but students complain that it increases their test-taking anxiety (McArthur,
2020
). The idea of being recorded by Proctorio distracts students and creates an uncomfortable test-taking atmosphere. In a similar vein, although Squirrel AI (Squirrel AI Learning Inc., China) aims to provide adaptive learning by adjusting itself automatically to the best method for an individual student, there is a risk that this might restrict students’ creative learning (Beard,
2020
). These environments have one thing in common: Unlike educational technologies that merely mediate interactions between instructors and students, AI systems have more autonomy in the way in which it interprets data, infers learning, and at times, takes instructional decisions.
In what follows, we describe Speed Dating with storyboards, an exploratory research method that allows participants to quickly experience different forms of AI systems possible in the near future, to examine the impact of those systems on learner–instructor interaction (“
Materials and methods
”). Findings offer new insights on students’ and instructors’ boundaries, such as when AI systems are perceived as “invasive” (“
Findings
”). Lastly, we discuss how our findings provide implications for future AI systems in online learning (
Discussion and conclusion
).
Materials and methods
The goal of this study is to gain insight on students’ and instructors’ perception of the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence; Kang & Im,
2013
) in online learning. The study was conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, thus students and instructors have heightened awareness about the importance of online learning and fresh experiences from the recent online courses. Our aim was not to evaluate specific AI technologies, but instead, to explore areas where AI systems positively contribute to learner–instructor interaction and where more attention is required.
We used Speed Dating with storyboards, an exploratory research method that allows participants to experience a number of possible AI systems in the form of storyboards, to prompt participants to critically reflect on the implications of each AI area (Zimmerman & Forlizzi,
2017
). Exposure to multiple potential AI areas that are likely to be available in the future helps participants to shape their own perspectives and to evaluate the AI systems in a more nuanced way (Luria et al.,
2020
). We first created a set of eleven four-cut storyboards for the comprehensive and diverse use cases of possible AI systems in online learning (see “
Creating storyboards
” section), and then used these storyboards to conduct Speed Dating with student and instructor participants (see “
Speed dating
” section). Overall, we address the following research question:
How do students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) in online learning?
Creating storyboards
To create AI system storyboards which are technically feasible and positively support learner–instructor interaction, we ran an online brainwriting activity (Linsey & Becker,
2011
) in which we asked a team of designers to come up with scenarios about possible AI systems in online learning. We recruited six designers from our lab (four faculty members and two PhD candidates) with an average of 15.4 years (SD = 4.7 years) of design experience in human–computer interaction (HCI). Each team member wrote down scenarios using a Google Slides file and then passed it on to another team member. This process was repeated four times until all designers agreed that the scenarios of AI systems were technically feasible and supported learner–instructor interaction in online learning.
As initial scenarios were made by HCI designers, in order to validate their technical feasibility and positive impact on learner–instructor interaction, we enacted additional interviews with six AI experts with an average of 10.8 years (SD = 7.8 years) of research experience and 8 years (SD = 6.2 years) of teaching experience (see Appendix A , Table
7
, for details). The first two authors conducted semi-structured interviews with AI experts using a video conferencing platform (i.e., Zoom). We showed each scenario to AI experts and asked the following questions: “Can you improve this scenario to make it technically feasible?” and “Can you improve this scenario to have a positive impact on learner–instructor interaction based on your own online teaching experience?” After showing all the scenarios, the following question was asked: “Do you have any research ideas that can be used as a new scenario?” The scenario was modified to reflect the opinions of AI experts and AIEd literature. The interviews lasted around 41 min on average (SD = 7.3 min). Each AI expert was compensated 100 Canadian dollars for their time. The process was cleared by the Research Ethics Board.
As shown in Table
2
, we ended up with 11 scenarios which support learner–instructor interaction (i.e., communication, support, and presence) in online learning. Scenarios were categorized by the first two authors with reference to the learner–instructor interaction factors as defined in Table
1
(see “
Theoretical framework
” section). For example, although the AI Teaching or Grading Assistant scenarios could be considered systems of support for the instructor, “support” within the learner–instructor interaction framework refers to support for the student. Therefore, since the scenarios illustrate increased or expedited communication between students and instructors rather than direct support for students, AI Teaching and Grading Assistant scenarios are categorized as systems for communication. We note that these categories are not definitive, and scenarios may have interleaving aspects of several learner–instructor interaction factors. However, the final categories in Table
2
refer to the factors that best define the respective scenarios.

Seven scenarios (Scenarios 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11) have well reflected the state-of-the-art AI systems that were identified in “Artificial intelligence in online learning” section. The following four scenarios were created based on research ideas from AI experts: AI Companion (Scenario 2), AI Peer Review (Scenario 4), AI Group Project Organizer (Scenario 7), and AI Breakout Room Matching (Scenario 10). These 11 final scenarios were not to exhaust all AI systems in online learning or to systematically address all topics, but rather to probe a range of situations that shed light on the realities that present themselves with the utilization of AI systems in online learning.
We generated four-cut storyboards based on the scenarios in Table

. Figure

shows an illustrated example of a storyboard detailing the scenario through captions. We stylized the characters in a single visual style and as flat cartoon shades in order to reduce gender and ethnic clues and enable participants to put themselves in the shoes of the characters in each storyboard (Truong et al.,

; Zimmerman & Forlizzi,

Participants
Next, we conducted a Speed Dating activity with storyboards. We recruited 12 students (see Table
3
) and 11 instructors (see Table
4
) for a Speed Dating activity. For diversity, we recruited students from 11 different majors and recruited instructors from nine different subjects. Students and instructors had a minimum of three months of online learning or teaching experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, students had at least one year of university experience and instructors had at least three years of teaching experience. We required students and instructors to have online learning and teaching experience respectively so as to control the expected and experienced norms of student-instructor interaction within online university classes. Conversely, we did not require participants to have knowledge of AI systems as we wanted their perspective on the intended human–AI interactions and their potential effects as illustrated. Previous studies showed that Speed Dating works well without any prior knowledge or experience with AI systems, so no special knowledge or experience was required to participate in this study (Luria et al.,
2020
; Zimmerman & Forlizzi,
2017
). Each participant was compensated with 25 Canadian dollars for their time.

Procedure
We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants using a video conferencing platform (i.e., Zoom). We designed the interview questions to capture how the participants perceive the AI systems illustrated in the storyboards (see Appendix B). Participants read each of the storyboards aloud and then expressed their perceptions of AI in online learning. Specifically, we asked participants to critically reflect on how incorporating the AI system into an online course would affect learner–instructor interaction and whether they would like to experience its effect. We also asked them to choose AI systems that would work well and which would not work well, to capture their holistic point of view regarding perceived affordances and drawbacks. The entire interview lasted around 50.9 min (SD = 10.7 min), with 3–5 min spent to share each storyboard and probe participants on its specific implications.
Data analysis
Each interview was audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. We used a Reflexive Thematic Analysis approach (Braun & Clarke,
2006
; Nowell et al.,
2017
). After a period of familiarization with the interview data, the first two authors began by generating inductive codes with an initial round of semantic codes related to intriguing statements or phrases in the data. The two authors then coded each transcript by highlighting and commenting on data items through Google Docs, independently identifying patterns that arose through extended examination of the dataset. Any conflicts regarding such themes were resolved through discussion between the two authors. Later, through a deductive approach guided by the learner–instructor interaction factors adapted from Kang and Im (
2013
), data were coded and collated into themes in a separate word document. An example of our codes can be viewed at
https://osf.io/3aj5v/?view_only=bc5fa97e6f7d46fdb66872588ff1e22e
. We then utilized three iterative discussions with all five authors present that yielded recurrent topics and themes by organizing the data around significant thematic units; the final six major themes were derived from twelve codes. The themes, which describe the impact of AI systems, were as follows: (1) Quantity and Quality, (2) Responsibility, (3) Just-in-time Support, (4) Agency, (5) Connection, and (6) Surveillance. The findings below are presented according to these themes.
Findings
The central theme of participants’ responses, which stood out repeatedly in our study, was that adopting AI systems in online learning can enable personalized learner–instructor interaction at scale but at the risk violating social boundaries. Participants were concerned that AI systems could create responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues in online learning if they violated social boundaries in each factor of learner–instructor interaction (i.e., communication, support, and presence). Table

summarizes the perceived benefits and concerns of students and instructors about the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction, as noted with ( +) and ( −) respectively. Each quote outlines whether the response came from a student (“S”) or an instructor (“I”).

Communication
In online learning environments, communication refers to questions and answers between students and the instructor about topics directly related to learning contents, such as instructional materials, assignments, discussions, and exams (Kang & Im,
2013
). Students and instructors expect AI systems will positively impact the quantity and quality of communication between them but bears the risk causing miscommunication and responsibility issues, as described below.
Quantity and quality
Students believe that the anonymity afforded by AI would make them less self-conscious and, as a result, allow them to ask more questions
. In online learning environments, students are generally afraid to ask questions to their instructors during class, primarily because they “worry that someone already asked it” (S4) or “don't want to seem dumb by instructors or peers” (S10). Students perceive that the anonymity from both an AI Teaching Assistant (Scenario 1) and an AI Companion (Scenario 2) would make them “less afraid to ask questions” (S10), “wouldn't feel bad about wasting the professor's time” (S11), and would be “less distracting to class” (S12). Bluntly put, participant S11 stated: “If it’s a dumb question, I’ve got an AI to handle it for me. The AI won't judge me. The AI is not thinking like, wow, what an idiot.” S5 expanded on this idea, mentioning that asking questions to an AI removes self-consciousness that typically exists in instructional communications: “… you don’t feel like you’re bothering a person by asking the questions. You can’t really irritate an AI, so you can ask as many as you need to.” As a result, all 12 students answered that AI systems would nudge them to ask more questions in online learning.
Instructors believe that AI could help answer simple, repetitive questions, which would allow them to focus on more meaningful communication with students
. Answering repetitive questions from students takes a huge amount of time (I11). Instructors reflected that the time saved from tedious tasks, such as answering administrative questions, could allow course teams to focus on more content-based questions (I10). Because an AI Teaching Assistant (Scenario 1) answers students’ repetitive questions and AI Grading Assistance (Scenario 3) and AI Peer Review (Scenario 4) enable fast feedback loops, instructors can communicate more meaningfully with students by helping to “focus more on new questions” (I6) or “use their time for more comprehensive or more irregular questions” (I4). As well-stated by I10: “I think it allows us time to have conversations that are more meaningful… in some ways you're choosing quality over quantity. The more time I have, the more time, I can do things like answer emails or answer things on Piazza, things that actually will communicate with the student.”
Responsibility
Although students believe AI systems would improve the quantity and quality of instructional communication, they worry that AI could give unreliable answers and negatively impact their grades
. For example, S4 worried that “I just want to make sure it’s a really reliable source, because if the AI is answering questions from students, and then they’re going to apply that answer to the way they do their work in the future, and it might be marked wrong. Then it's hard to go to the instructor and say, oh, this answer was what was given to me, but you said it was wrong.” Most students (10 out of 12) feel like the lack of explainability of AI would make it hard to blame despite the fact that it may hold a position of responsibility in some situations, such as answering questions where its answers should be considered as truth. S9 said that “Whereas with AI and just intelligent systems that you don't fully understand the back end to in a sense, it’s harder to decipher the reasoning behind the answer or why they gave that answer.” In particular, students are concerned about how instructors would react if something went wrong because they trusted the AI. S11 expects that “I can see a lot of my fellow engineering students finding more room to argue for their marks. I can see people not being as willing to accept their fate with this kind of system.”
Instructors predicted conflicts between students and the instructor due to AI-based misunderstandings or misleadingness
. For example, a conflict could arise from potential discrepancies between answers from AI, the instructor, and human TAs. As expressed by I4, “Students will argue that, oh AI is wrong. I demand a better assessment right? So, you can say that easily for the AI. But for the authoritative figure like TA and instructor, maybe it's hard to do that.” Similarly, I6 argued a conflict could stem from the opposite direction: “If an AI gives students a great suggestion, if the instructor and TA decided to regrade, it would just be a lot of trouble.” Several instructors (five out of 11) also worried about conflicts that could arise from the quality of response. I1 said that “The concern is the quality of the response, given that there can be ambiguity in the way the students post questions. My concern here is that the algorithm may respond incorrectly or obliquely.” I8 also cautioned AI-based misunderstandings or misleadingness: “If you have a conversation in person, you can always clarify misunderstandings or things like that. I don't think a machine can do that yet. So there's a bit of a potential for misunderstandings so misleading the students.”
Support
In online learning environments, support refers to the instructor’s instructional management for students, such as providing feedback, explanations, or recommendations directly related to what is being taught (Kang & Im,
2013
). Students and instructors expect a positive impact from AI systems in terms of enabling just-in-time personalized support for students at scale, but they expect a negative impact in that excessive support could reduce student agency and ownership of learning.
Just-in-time support
Students believe that AI would support personalized learning experiences, particularly with studying and group projects
. Ultimately, all 12 students felt that AI could help them work to their strengths, mainly in scenarios regarding instructor-independent activities like studying (Scenario 5, 6, 8) and group projects (Scenario 7). Students like S2, S3, and S9 focused on how adaptive technologies could make studying more effective and efficient, as it would “allow [them] to fully understand the concept of what [they’re] learning,” and “allows for them to try and focus on where they might be weaker.” In some cases, the sense of personalization led students to describe the systems as if they could fulfill roles as members of the course team. For example, S1 referred to the Adaptive Quiz system (Scenario 8) as a potential source of guidance: “I think being able to have that quiz to help me, guide me, I’m assuming it would help me.” Likewise, S5 described the presence of an AI Group Project Organizer (Scenario 7) as “having a mentor with you, helping you do it” which would help students “focus more on maybe just researching things, writing their papers, whatever they need to do for the project.”
Instructors believe AI could be effectively leveraged to help students receive just-in-time personalized support
. I1 said that “one of the best learning mechanisms is to be confronted right away with the correct answer or the correct way of finding the right answer” when doing quizzes and assignments. Many instructors (10 out of 11) expressed approval towards AI-based Intelligent Suggestions (Scenario 5) and an Adaptive Quiz system (Scenario 8). All 11 instructors appreciated how immediate feedback afforded by AI could help students study and effectively understand gaps in their knowledge, particularly at times when they would be unavailable. Similarly, I4 and I11 appreciated that AI could support students who would otherwise be learning asynchronously. For example, AI systems could be supportive of student engagement “because the students are getting real-time answers, particularly in an online world where they may not be in the same time zone, this is a synchronous type [of] learning event for them where they could be doing it when they're studying” (I11).
Agency
Despite the fact that students appreciated the support that they could potentially receive from AI, students perceived that canned and standardized support might have a negative influence on their ability to learn effectively
. For example, S11 shared how he felt the usage of systems that collect engagement data would “over standardize” the learning process by prescribing how an engaged student would or should act. He likened some of the AI examples to “helicopter parenting,” expressing that guidance—whether from an AI or parent—can set an arbitrary pace for a student to follow, despite the fact that the learning experience should involve “learning about yourself and going at your own pace.” Several other students (four out of 12) were concerned with the potential effect of a system like the AI Group Project Organizer (Scenario 7), citing concerns that students “wouldn’t put that much effort” into their group projects because “it might just end up AI doing all the work for them” (S2). Similarly, S6 focused on how AI could detract from the fact that experiences with schoolwork can help students later in life: “… I think it’s like giving them a false sense of security in the sense that like, I’m so used to doing projects with this AI helper that when I go into the real world, I’m not going to be ready. I’m just not going to be prepared for it.”
Instructors are similarly wary of the fact that too much support from AI could take away students' opportunities for exploration and discovery
. Many instructors (nine out of 11) were concerned that students could lose opportunities to learn new skills or learn from their mistakes. Responding about the AI Group Project Organizer (Scenario 7), I7 stressed that she wouldn’t want to standardize inconsistent group projects since part of an instructor’s job is “helping people understand how group work is conducted… [and] if you’re just laying on a simple answer, you miss that opportunity.” Similarly, other instructors (five out of 12)—primarily those in humanities-based fields—were concerned “it may take the creativity away from the students” since students’ projects “can be hugely different from each other, yet equally good,” and suggestions based on historical data could steer students towards certain directions (I6). I4 even expressed that he currently tries “not to share previous work because [he] thinks that restricts their creativity.” After experiencing all the storyboards related to AI-powered support, I11 presented a vital question: “At what stage is it students’ work and what stage is it the AI’s algorithm?”.
Presence
In online learning environments, presence refers to a factor that makes students and instructors perceive each other’s existence during the learning process (Kang & Im,
2013
). Students and instructors expect the impact of AI systems to be positive in terms of giving them a feeling of improved connectivity, and to be negative in terms of increasing the risk of surveillance problems.
Connection
Students believe that AI can address privacy concerns and support learner–instructor connections by providing social interaction cues without personal camera information
. Many students (10 out of 12) stated that they don’t want to turn on their camera in online courses, even though turning off the camera adversely affects their presence in class, because they have concerns like: “looking like a mess” (S1), “just in my pajamas” (S2), and “feeling too invasive” (S4). Specifically, S9 stated that turning on the camera “makes you more anxious and conscious of what you’re doing and as a result, it deters from you engaging with the content.” In this sense, most students (11 out of 12) liked the Virtual Avatar system (Scenario 9), where AI communicates student facial expressions and body language to the instructor via a virtual avatar. Students expect that this will make them “feel more comfortable going to lecture” (S2), “feel less intrusive for at home learning” (S4), and “showcase much more of their expression or confusion or understanding” (S10). Overall, many students (nine out of 12) appreciated the potential of AI systems as “it solves the problem of not needing to show your actual face, but you can still get your emotions across to the instructor” (S10).
Instructors believe that the addition of AI would help them become more aware of students’ needs
. Many instructors (10 out of 11), particularly those that taught larger undergraduate courses, stated that students tend to turn off their cameras in online learning spaces, “so something that you really, really miss from teaching online is reading body language” (I10). Instructors generally expressed that AI systems like the Virtual Avatar (Scenario 9) and the AI Facial Analytics (Scenario 11) could be helpful, due to the fact that they would allow students to share their body language and facial expressions without directly sharing their video feed. I4 appreciated that the AI Facial Analytics could automate the process of looking at students’ faces “to see if they got it.” Similarly, I5 liked that a Virtual Avatar could give “any sign that someone is listening,” as “it’s sometimes very tough, especially if [she’s] making a joke.” Furthermore, I4 emphasized that turning on the camera can be helpful not just for the instructor but also for students’ own accountability since “if students don’t turn on the camera, it’s very likely that they are going to do something else.” Overall, instructors appreciated AI’s ability to provide critical information to understand how students are doing and how they feel in online courses.
Surveillance
Although AI can strengthen the connection between students and instructors, students are uncomfortable with the measurement of their unconscious behavior, such as eye tracking or facial expression analysis, because it feels like surveillance
. All 12 students discussed how they would be anxious about being represented by unconscious eye-tracking data. S1 professed: “I don't really know what my eyes are doing. I think it might just make me a little nervous when it comes to taking quizzes or tests and all that. I might be scared that I might have accidentally cheated.” S12 additionally spoke on how that would make her more anxious when sending emails or asking questions due to concern that instructors would judge him based on his unconscious behavior before taking care of his questions. Note that most students (10 out of 12) feel uncomfortable with AI Facial Analytics (Scenario 11). For example, S6 was concerned that facial expression is “something that happens [that] might be outside of your control,” so AI might miss the nuance of authentic human emotion and flatten and simplify it in a way that might cause more confusion. In a similar vein, S11 said that “The nuances of social interaction is something that should be left up to humans and not guided because it’s innately something that, that’s what makes us human is the social interaction portion.” Overall, students complained that they didn’t want to use AI’s measures of unconscious behavior, such as eye tracking or facial expression analysis, even if there are positive aspects.
Instructors were negative about relying on AI interpretation to understand students’ social interaction cues
. All instructors felt uncomfortable with collecting private data, such as eye movements and facial expressions of students through AI, because “not all the students feel comfortable sharing their private information with the instructor” (I2, I5). Additionally, I9 was concerned that AI Facial Analytics might force students to smile to get a good engagement score, which could adversely affect online learning itself. In this sense, many instructors (nine out of 11) declined to use AI systems that use eye tracking and facial expression analysis in their online courses. Furthermore, I6 would rather “choose to rely on my own kind of sense of the classroom dynamic instead of AI systems” because she believed that the social relationship between students and instructors should be authentic. Plus, other instructors stated they “don’t have time to check all of the interface[s]”, or would have trouble “knowing that that data is accurately reflecting, [that] the student is responding to [their] content” rather than extraneous stimulation in their personal environments (I3, I7). Overall, instructors were uncomfortable with AI giving detailed information about how students engage with their online courses, and they wanted to understand these social interaction cues for themselves.
In summary, students and instructors expect that AI systems will benefit learner–instructor interaction in online learning in terms of improving the quantity and quality of communication, enabling just-in-time personalized support for students at scale, and giving them a feeling of improved connectivity. However, at the same time, students and instructors were concerned that AI systems could create responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues in online learning if they violated social boundaries. These boundaries that make AI perceived to be negative will be discussed in the next section.
Discussion and conclusion
Our research question focused on examining how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) in online learning. Although the growing body of AIEd research has been conducted to investigate the useful functionalities of AI systems (Seo et al.,
2020b
; Popenici & Kerr,
2017
; Zawacki-Richter et al.,
2019
), little has been done to understand students’ and instructors’ concerns on AI systems. Recent use of AI systems in online learning showed that careless application can cause surveillance and privacy issues (Lee,
2020
), which makes students feel uncomfortable (Bajaj & Li,
2020
). In this study, we found that students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems as double-edged swords. Consequently, although AI systems have been positively recognized for improving the quantity and quality of communication, for providing just-in-time, personalized support for large-scale students, and for improving the feeling of connection, there were concerns about responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues. In fact, what students and instructors perceive negatively often stemmed from the positive aspects of AI systems. For example, students and instructors appreciated AI’s immediate communication, but at the same time they were concerned about AI-based misunderstandings or misleadingness. Although students and instructors valued the just-in-time, personalized support of AI, they feared that AI would limit their ability to learn independently. Students and instructors valued the social interaction cues provided by AI, but they are uncomfortable with the loss of privacy due to AI’s excessive data collection. As shown in Table
6
, this study provides rich opportunities to identify the boundaries beyond which AI systems are perceived as “invasive.”
Table 6 Summary of the boundaries beyond which AI systems are perceived as invasive, and their potential solutions
Full size table
First, although AI systems improve instructional communication due to the anonymity it can provide for students, students were concerned about responsibility issues that could arise when AI’s unreliable and unexplained answers lead to negative consequences. For instance, when communicating with an AI Teaching Assistant, the black-box nature of the AI system leaves no choices for students to check whether the answers from AI are right or wrong (Castelvecchi,
2016
). Accordingly, students believe they would have a hard time deciphering the reasoning behind an AI’s answer. This can result in serious responsibility issues if students apply an AI’s answers to their tests but instructors mark them as wrong. As well, students would find more room to argue for their marks because of AI’s unreliability.
Acknowledging that AI systems cannot always provide the right answer, a potential solution to this problem is to ensure the system is explainable. Explainability refers to the ability to offer human-understandable justifications for the AI’s output or procedures (Gunning,
2017
). Explainability gives students the opportunity to check whether an AI’s answer is right or wrong by themselves, and in doing so can make AI more reliable and responsible (Gunning,
2017
). Explainability should be the boundary that determines students’ trust and acceptance of AI systems. How to ensure the explainability of AI systems in the online learning communication context will be an interesting research topic. For example, instead of providing unreliable answers that may mislead or confuse students, AI systems should connect students to relevant sources of information that students can navigate on their own.
Second, while AI systems enable some degree of personalized support, there is a risk of over-standardizing the learning process by prescribing how an engaged student would or should act. Despite the fact that students appreciate the support that they could potentially receive from AI systems, students also worry that canned and standardized support would have a negative influence on their agency over their own learning. Instructors are similarly wary of the fact that too much support from AI systems could take away students’ opportunities for exploration and discovery. Many instructors were concerned that students could lose opportunities to learn new skills or learn from their mistakes.
A solution to mediate this challenge may be to keep instructors involved. The role of AI systems in online education should not be to reduce learning to a set of canned and standardized procedures that reduce the student agency, but rather to enhance human thinking and augment the learning process. In practice, adaptive support is often jointly enacted by AI systems and human facilitators, such as instructors or peers (Holstein et al.,
2020
). In this context, Baker (
2016
, p. 603) tried to reconcile humans with AI systems by combining “stupid tutoring systems and intelligent humans.” AI systems can process large amounts of information quickly, but do not respond well to complex contexts. Humans cannot process information as AI systems do, but instead they are flexible and intelligent in a variety of contexts. When AI systems bring human beings into the decision-making loop and try to inform them, humans can learn more efficiently and effectively (Baker,
2016
). The human-in-the-loop is the solution to ensure students’ perceived agency in online learning. How to balance artificial and human intelligences to promote students’ agency is an important research direction (e.g., goldilocks conditions for human–AI interaction; Seo et al.,
2020a
).
Third, even though AI strengthens the perceived connection between students and instructors, students are uncomfortable with the measurement of their unconscious behavior, such as facial expression analysis or eye tracking, as it feels like surveillance. While most students liked the Virtual Avatar system (Scenario 9) where AI simply delivers student facial expressions and body language to the instructor via an avatar, students declined to use the AI Facial Analytics (Scenario 11), which might miss the nuance of social interaction by flattening and simplifying it in a way that might cause more confusion. Interpreting social interaction from unconscious behavior could be the boundary beyond which AI systems are perceived as “invasive.” Students felt uncomfortable about being represented by their unconscious behavior because they did not know what their gaze or face was doing. Stark (

) described facial recognition as the plutonium of AI: “[facial recognition] is dangerous, racializing, and has few legitimate uses; facial recognition needs regulation and control on par with nuclear waste.” Students complained about their presence being represented by the interpretation of the AI system. In a similar vein, the instructor negatively felt the AI system’s involvement in interpreting the meaning of student behavior.
Establishing clear, simple, and transparent data norms and agreements about the nature of data being collected from students and what kind of data is okay to be presented to instructors are important considerations for future research (Ferguson,
2019
; Tsai et al.,
2020
).
While this study revealed important findings and implications for using AI systems in online learning, the study recognizes some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the patterns of the results. First, although this study attempted to capture various forms of AI systems in online learning based on the ideations from HCI designers and AI experts, it might be possible that other kinds of AI systems exist. Different AI systems might offer different insights. As such, further studies can be conducted with different kinds of AI systems. Next, students’ and instructors’ perceptions of AI systems could be affected by different disciplines. In the current study, we recruited students and instructors in diverse majors and subjects. Although this helped us to generalize our findings from participants with diverse backgrounds, there’s more room to investigate how students and instructors in different disciplines perceive AI systems differently. In our findings, we anecdotally found that instructors in humanities-based fields were more concerned about rapport with students and students’ creativity in courses compared to other disciplines. In order to fully investigate this, future research should consider the different learner–instructor interaction needs of participants from different majors (e.g., engineering vs. humanities).
Another limitation is that the study was conducted by reading the storyboards, rather than directly interacting with AI systems. This might have limited participants’ perceptions about the AI systems. If participants have continuous, direct interactions with the AI systems in the real world, their perceptions may change. As such, future researchers should examine students’ responses to direct exposures of AI systems. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, one could conduct a lab experiment using virtual reality, the wizard-of-oz method, or the user enactment method to see how students actually respond to AI systems. It would also be meaningful to conduct a longitudinal study to understand whether and/or how student perceptions would change over time.
Theoretical implications
This study provides theoretical implications for a learner–instructor interaction framework by highlighting and mapping key challenges in AI-related ethical issues (i.e. responsibility, agency, and surveillance) in online learning environments. Researchers have requested clear ethical guidelines for future research to prevent AI systems from accidently harming people (Loi et al.,
2019
). Although several ethical frameworks and professional codes of conduct have been developed to mitigate the potential dangers and risks of AI in education, significant debates continue about their specific impact on students and instructors (Williamson & Eynon,
2020
). The results of this study increase our understanding of the boundaries that determine student and instructor trust and acceptance of AI systems, and provide a theoretical background for designing AI systems that positively support learner–instructor interactions in a variety of learning situations.
Practical implications
This study has practical implications for both students and instructors. Interestingly, most of the negative experiences with AI systems came from students’ unrealistic expectations and misunderstandings about AI systems. The AI system’s answer is nothing more than an algorithm based on accumulated data, yet students typically expect the AI system to be accurate. These misconceptions can be barriers to the effective use of AI systems by students and instructors. To address this, it is important to foster AI literacy in students and instructors without a technical background (Long & Magerko,
2020
). For example, recent studies have published guides on how to incorporate AI into K-12 curricula (Touretzky et al.,
2019
), and researchers are exploring how to engage young learners in creative programming activities involving AI (Zimmermann-Niefield et al.,
2019
).
Furthermore, in order to minimize the negative impact of AI systems on learner–instructor interaction, it is important to address tensions where AI systems violate the boundaries between students and instructors (e.g., responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues). We proposed that future AI systems should ensure explainability, human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation. By doing so, AI systems will be more closely integrated into future online learning. It is important to note that the present study does not argue that AI systems will replace the entire role of human instructors. Rather, in the online learning of the future, AI systems and humans will work closely together, and for this, it is important to use these systems with consideration about perceived affordances and drawbacks.

For your information, the interview will take about 60 min. The interview will be audio recorded but will be confidential and de-identified.
2. For each storyboard
Do you think this AI system supports learner–instructor interaction? Yes, no, or do you feel neutral? Why?
[When the participant is a student] Would the incorporation of this AI system into your courses change your interaction with the instructor?
[When the participant is an instructor] Would incorporating this AI system into the course change how you interact with students?
Do you have any reservations or concerns about this AI system?
3. After examining all storyboards (capturing participants’ holistic point of view)
Of the storyboards shown today, which AI systems do you think would work well in your online classroom? Why? Also, which ones wouldn’t work well?
How do you think the adoption of AI would affect the relationship between students and the instructor?
4. Conclusion
Do you have any final comments?
Thank you for taking the time to interview with us today. We really appreciate that you took time to participate in our study and share your expertise. Your insights were really helpful.

Abstract
The focus of higher education institutions is the preparation of future professionals. To achieve this aim, innovative teaching methods are often deployed, including games and simulations, which form the subject of this paper. As the field of digital games and simulations is ever maturing, this paper attempts to systematically review the literature relevant to games and simulation pedagogy in higher education. Two researchers collaborate to apply a qualitative method, coding and synthesizing the results using multiple criteria. The main objective is to study the impact of games and simulations with regard to achieving specific learning objectives. On balance, results indicate that games and/or simulations have a positive impact on learning goals. The researchers identify three learning outcomes when integrating games into the learning process: cognitive, behavioural, and affective. As a final step, the authors consolidate evidence for the benefit of academics and practitioners in higher education interested in the efficient use of games and simulations for pedagogical purposes. Such evidence also provides potential options and pathways for future research.
Introduction
As rapidly evolving technological applications, games and simulations are already widely integrated in the traditional educational process. They are deployed extensively in the field of education, with an existing body of work examining the relation between games and education (Yang, Chen, & Jeng,
2010
; Chiang, Lin, Cheng, & Liu,
2011
). In recent years, digital or web-based games have increasingly supported learning. In the context of online education, this research area attracts a significant amount of interest from the scientific and educational community, for example tutors, students and game designers. With the growing expansion of technology, instructors and those who create educational policy are interested in introducing innovative technological tools, such as video games, virtual worlds, and Massive Multi-Player Online Games (MMPOGs) (Buckless,
2014
; Gómez,
2014
).
Games and simulations show mixed effects across a number of sectors, such as student performance, engagement, and learning motivation. However, as these studies focus only on certain disciplines, there remains a gap in the literature concerning a clear framework of use across academic programmes. As a result, the issue of efficiently integrating games and simulations in the educational process is often up to the instructor’s discretion. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to develop a framework to allow educators across disciplines to better understand the advantages and draw backs of games and simulations specific to their pedagogical goals.
Rationale of the study
The researchers set out to examine the effectiveness of games and simulations in the learning experience, and immediately encounter the first challenge, which relates to a lack of clear empirical evidence on the issue (Farrington,
2011
). The scientific field is too extensive and requires further investigation. Furthermore, there is currently no formal policy framework or guidelines recommended by governments or educational institutions on the adoption of games and simulations in education. This is the case for many countries in Europe, the US, and Australia, where it is the responsibility of the instructor or institution to incorporate games into the curriculum.
The main motivation for the current review lies in the fact that games are already, to a certain degree, integrated into educational systems to achieve a variety of learning outcomes (Connolly,
2012
), yet a comprehensive policy is still lacking. In this paper, the first step was an attempt to conceptualize the terms “game” and “simulations”. Although the two terms are neither wholly synonymous, or completely differentiated, in the main body of this review, the focus will be on lumping them together and perceiving them as points across a multidimensional continuum (Aldrich,
2009
; Renken,
2016
), since these educational technologies are consolidated under the umbrella of an interactive virtual environment in digital education.
A primary aim is to identify studies concentrating on the use of games and simulations for learning purposes, and to analyse the results by comparing them to prior studies’ findings. Two research questions guide the review analysis: a) How can the best practices/methods for designing and incorporating games and simulations in student learning be identified? b) How can games/simulations enhance Higher Education?
The major difference between the current review and the previous reviews in the field is the conceptualization of the terms “games and simulations”, which acts as an umbrella for further typologies. In other words, the researchers include more genres of games and simulations in their systematic review, compared to the other literature reviews. In addition, the researchers’ intention is to focus on the impacts of games and simulations on learning outcomes. The researchers don’t focus only on the cognitive outcomes, which is the most obvious and common topic among other researchers but, simultaneously, they analyze behavioural and affective effects as well. Furthermore, most of the previous reviews focus on the impacts of games and simulations on the learning process of certain subjects (e.g. Science, Business, Nursing, etc.), whereas this study expands research in a wide spectrum of academic disciplines and subjects. Overall, the current study offers a systematic review that opens new areas for further discussion, highlighting that collaborative learning, teamwork and students’ engagement also play a significant role for a successful learning process.
Conceptualising games and simulations
Games
In recent years, the interest in examining game use in higher education has increased. This includes educational games (Çankaya & Karamete,
2009
), digital game-based learning (DGBL) (Yang,
2012
), and applied games (van Roessel & van Mastrigt-Ide,
2011
). In addition, scholars, sometimes, include interactive exercises (Mueller,
2003
), video games (Biddiss & Irwin,
2010
), or even expand to next generation video games (Bausch,
2008
), in the category of games. With respect to web-based games, the technological platforms that implement digital game code include computers and consoles (Salen & Zimmerman,
2004
). They can run on a web browser on mobile phones and other mobile gaming devices (Willoughby,
2008
) (e.g., tablets).
Despite the abundance of game types, there is a lack of clear, shared definitions and terminology among scholars and educators, which has led to “terminological ambiguity” (Klabbers,
2009
). Nevertheless, the need for shared terminology remains when discussing the different forms of games and simulations in higher education. Although academics and game developers may use varying taxonomy to categorise games, the majority broadly agree on the following seven genres (Gros,
2007
):
1.
Action games:
response-based video games.
2.
Adventure games:
the player solves problems to progress through levels within a virtual world.
3.
Fighting games:
these involve fighting with computer-controlled characters or those controlled by other players.
4.
Role-playing games:
players assume the roles of fictional characters.
5.
Simulations:
games modelled after natural or man-made systems or phenomena, in which players have to achieve pre-specified goals.
6.
Sports games:
these are based on different kinds of sports.
7.
Strategy games:
these recreate historical scenes or fictional scenarios, in which players must devise an appropriate strategy to achieve the goal.
In recent years, several well-designed empirical studies investigating the effects of serious games on learning outcomes have been published. Sawyer refers to serious games as those games produced by the video game industry that have a substantial connection to the acquisition of knowledge (Sawyer,
2002
). Zyda (
2005
) expands Sawyer’s definition, adding that serious games are games whose primary purpose is not entertainment, enjoyment or fun. Serious games, educational gaming, as well as virtual worlds developed for educational purposes reveal the potential of these technologies to engage and motivate beyond leisure activities (Anderson et al.,
2009
). At the same time, there is extensive literature exploring the potential learning benefits offered by game-based learning (GBL), which can be defined as the use of game-based technology to deliver, support, and enhance teaching, learning, assessment, and evaluation (Connolly,
2007
).
Simulations
Simulations create a scenario-based environment, where students interact to apply previous knowledge and practical skills to real-world problems, also allowing teachers to reach their own goals, as well (Andreu-Andrés & García-Casas,
2011
; García-Carbonell & Watts,
2012
; Angelini,
2015
). During scenario-based training, the player acquires important skills, such as interpersonal communication, teamwork, leadership, decision-making, task prioritising and stress management (Flanagan,
2004
). The practical scenario may be carried out individually or within a team (Robertson et al.,
2009
), leading to collaboration and knowledge sharing.
With the explosion of Web 2.0 technology, increased opportunities to engage with technological applications in a collaborative and participatory way have emerged, promoting information access, shared ideas, knowledge exchange, and content production (McLoughlin & Lee,
2008
). Digital simulations, which engage students in the interactive, authentic, and self-driven acquisition of knowledge, are being adopted in higher education. Connolly and Stansfield (
2006
) define game-based e-learning as a digital approach which delivers, supports, and enhances teaching, learning, assessment, and evaluation. Game-based e-learning is differentiated from GBL, which tends to cover both computer and non-computer games.
Delivery platforms are an essential aspect for game designers when creating and distributing games and simulations (e.g. computer, video, online, mobile, 3D, etc.). Designers must pay attention to characteristics such as the technical challenges, modules and techniques associated with the game design, the players involved in gaming, and the teaching modes (e.g. single, multi-player, collaborative, synchronous, etc.). This study examines the diverse curricular areas and learning objectives each game intends to access. The above-mentioned game classification is presented below (Fig.
1
).

The main difference between games and simulations is the following: games are tools which are artificial and pedagogical; they include conflict, rules, and predetermined goals, whereas simulations are dynamic tools, representing reality, claiming fidelity, accuracy, and validity (Sauve,
2007
).
Previously conducted reviews/meta-analyses on games and simulations in higher education
To establish a context
,
the researchers, initially, examined the relevant literature on the effectiveness of all types of games and simulations in learning outcomes. Many papers are analysed and summarised as follows, providing useful guidance for this study.
Through their systematic review, Tsekleves et al. (
2014
) provide insight into the barriers and benefits of using serious games in education. (Regarding benefits, the authors catalogue: achievement and rewards, interactivity and feedback, motivation and competition, playfulness and problem-based learning, collaborative learning, progression and repetition, as well as realism and immersion. Finally, they propose some guidelines to help stakeholders better implement serious games in education. Similarly, Bellotti, (
2013
) suggest useful guidelines for the performance assessment of serious games. Following user performance assessments, they offer an overview on the effectiveness of serious games in relation to learning outcomes. Results reveal the effectiveness of serious games in motivating and achieving learning goals, the importance of providing appropriate user feedback, while emphasizing that new types of games are best deployed through proper instructor guidance. Moreover, they stress aspects they consider important, such as performance assessment with a view to fostering adaptivity, as well as personalisation, and meeting needs on an individual basis (e.g. learning styles, information provision rates, feedback, etc.).
The instructor’s role is also outlined by Lameras et al. (
2016
) who provide conceptual and empirical evidence on the manner in which learning attributes and game mechanics should be designed and incorporated by faculty, specifically with a view to fully integrate these into lesson plans and the learning process as a whole. Games allow practitioners to quickly come to grips with the way in which learning activities, outcomes, feedback and roles may vary, as well as to enhance the in-game learning experience. Similarly, the systematic review of 64 articles by de Smale, (
2015
) concludes that there is a positive or neutral relationship between the use of simulations and games and learning achievement. The researchers arrive at three recurring conditions for the successful use of simulations and games: the specificity of the game, its integration in the course, and the role of a guiding instructor, which are all conditions in line with Bellotti et al. (
2013
)‘s results.
Young et al. (
2012
) choose 39 articles that meet the inclusion criteria related to video games and academic achievement, concentrating on the use of traditional games versus video games for educational purposes. The studies are categorised by subject, namely History, Mathematics, Physical Education, Science, and Languages. Results indicate that there exists limited evidence of the benefits of including education games in the traditional classroom environments, a finding which is contrary to the aforementioned studies. Smetana and Bell (
2012
) examine computer simulations to support instruction and learning in Science. In their comparative study between computer games and traditional games, they conclude that computer games can be as effective, if not more so, than traditional games in promoting knowledge, developing procedural skills and facilitating conceptual change. To integrate them properly as supplementary elements (Rajan,
2013
), games require the adoption of high-quality support structures, student participation, as well the promotion of cognitive and metacognitive skills. This finding contradicts the study carried out by Girard, (
2013
). This study treats video games as serious games but considers their effectiveness as a controversial issue, finding that only few games result in improved learning, while others have no positive effect on knowledge and skills acquisition, when compared to more traditional methods of teaching.
In contrast, in their meta-analysis, Clark et al. (
2015
) systematically review articles to study the detailed effects of digital games on learning outcomes, concluding that games are important in supporting productive learning and highlighting the significant role of gaming design beyond its medium. Prior to this review, but running along the same lines, Backlund and Hendrix (
2013
), in their meta-analysis reported positive outcomes in learning when using serious games in the educational process. Wouters, (
2013
) performing meta-analytic techniques, used comparisons as well, to investigate whether serious games are more effective and more motivating than conventional instructional methods. They found higher effectiveness in terms of learning and retention, but less motivation compared to traditional instructional methods. Indeed, serious games tend to be more effective if regarded as a supplement to other instructional methods, and involve students in groups and multiple training sessions.
These findings are compatible with those in the survey conducted by Rutten, (
2012
), which focuses on implementing games as laboratory activities, concluding that simulations have gained a prominent position in classrooms by enhancing the teacher’s repertoire, either as a supplement to traditional teaching methods or as a partial replacement of the curriculum. Nevertheless, they stress that the acquisition of laboratory skills cannot be wholly conducted via simulations. However, in areas where simulations have been widely accepted as a training tool, simulations can play a significant role in making lab activities more effective when offered as pre-lab training. Fu, (
2016
), through a systematic literature review, identify the multi-dimensional positive impact of serious games in business education, with the most frequent outcomes being knowledge acquisition and content understanding. The study also confirms that GBL and serious games can influence player engagement, perpetual and cognitive skills and social or soft skills. The affective and motivational outcomes are examined in entertainment games, games for learning and serious games, which reflects the trend of using gaming elements as both a medium of entertainment as well as a mode of learning. Ritzhaupt, (
2014
) produce meta-analysis based on 73 articles, demonstrating that achievement measures (e.g., standardised test scores) are the most commonly investigated, while the second most frequent is affective measures (e.g., usability or attitudes towards technology) followed by behavioural measures (e.g., task behaviour).
Merchant, (
2014
), via a meta-analysis, compare the effectiveness of games, simulations and virtual worlds in improving learning outcomes. Findings indicate that playing games individually enhance student performance more than playing collaboratively. Nonetheless, the researchers claim that there is no statistically significant difference between the effects of individual and cooperative instructional modules regarding simulations. Student learning outcomes deteriorate after repeated measures, since after spending a certain amount of time playing games, the learning outcome gains start to diminish. On the contrary, Shin, (
2015
), through meta-analysis, aim to identify the effects of patient simulation in nursing education. They find significant post-intervention improvements in various domains for participants who receive simulation education compared to the control groups, thus leading to the conclusion that simulations are more effective than traditional learning methods, enhancing the player’s psychomotor, affective, and cognitive skills. In their work, simulations provide students with authentic clinical situations, allowing them to practice and experience in realistic and safe environments.
Connolly et al. (
2012
) develop a multi-dimensional approach to categorising games and offer a review of 129 papers on computer games and serious games, explicitly targeting cognitive, behavioural, affective and motivational impacts, as well as engagement. The most frequent outcomes are knowledge acquisition and content understanding, as well as affective and motivational outcomes. Gegenfurtner, (
2014
) in their meta-analysis of the cognitive domain, examine how design elements in simulation-based settings affect self-efficacy and transfer of learning. They conclude that gathering feedback post-training, as opposed to during the process, results in higher estimates of self-efficacy and transfer of learning.
Researchers also look at games and simulations from a theoretical perspective. Li and Tsai (
2013
), examine the theoretical background and models employed in the study of games and simulations. They focus principally on the theories of cognitivism, constructivism, enactivism, and the socio-cultural perspective. Results indicate that although cognitivism and constructivism are the major theoretical foundations employed by game-based science learning researchers, enactivism and the socio-cultural perspective are the emerging theoretical paradigms drawing increasing attention in this field. This literature review indicates an increasing recognition of the effectiveness of digital games in promoting scientific knowledge and concept learning, while giving lesser importance to facilitation of problem-solving skills, exploring outcomes from the viewpoint of scientific processes, affect, engagement and socio-contextual learning. This view is echoed by other researchers, such as Warren, (
2016
), who systematically review and demonstrate the effectiveness of simulation games on satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, skills and learning outcomes within nurse practitioner programmes. After comparing online simulation-based learning with traditional lectures, they find an increase in student knowledge and confidence when using simulation games. Peterson (
2010
) also performs a meta-analysis, examining the use of computerised games and simulations in language education from a psycholinguistic and socio-cultural viewpoint. Results show valuable opportunities for effective language learning, confirming that games are beneficial in helping students learn another language.
Sitzmann (
2011
), using interactive cognitive complexity theory, offers a comparative review on the instructional effectiveness of computer simulations. To perform the review, she examines three affective outcomes (motivation, effort, and self-efficacy), one behavioural (effort), two cognitive (declarative knowledge and retention), and two skill-based learning outcomes (procedural knowledge and transfer). She concludes that, post-training, simulation-trained learners demonstrate higher self-efficacy and procedural knowledge. Furthermore, she highlights the significance of using specific methods to improve simulation learning, namely, integration of game use within an instructional programme, high level of learner activity, no gaming time limit, and adopting the simulation game as a supplement to other methods, which is inconsistent with Wouters et al.’s survey (
2013
). Hsu et al. (
2012
) provide a cross-analysed content analysis agreeing with the previous researchers that topics such as “Motivation, Perceptions and Attitudes” are of utmost importance.
In a recent review of business literature, Carenys and Moya (
2016
) discuss the impact of digital game-based learning (DGBL) on students. They examine DGBL both from a theoretical point of view and on a practical basis through three stages: a) the evaluation of digital games in the preparatory stage, b) specifying which research has been deemed appropriate for DGBL deployment, and c) the learning outcomes (cognitive, behavioural, affective, and multi-dimensional) that can be attained through digital games. This study moved current research forward in understanding the effectiveness of digital games and advanced the use of digital games in the classroom.
A variety of meta-analyses and systematic reviews have examined the implementation of games and simulations in the learning process, either as a main course element or as a supplement to conventional lectures, illustrating the ever increasing interest of researchers in this promising field.
Synthesis of previous reviews/meta-analyses
After studying the previous reviews, it is evident that the most commonly referred games in past reviews are digital and computerized games (Sitzmann,
2011
; Young et al.,
2012
; Smetana & Bell,
2012
; Girard et al.,
2013
; Merchant et al.,
2014
; Clark et al.,
2015
; Carenys & Moya,
2016
; Warren et al.,
2016
). The technological revolution and the invasion of Internet in Higher Education urge students to build digital and collaborative skills for the twenty-first century through gaming. Also, the emergence of a participatory culture in education spurs researchers to get involved with digital games and simulations. Other games mentioned are serious games and their impact on the learning process (Connolly et al.,
2012
; Bellotti et al.,
2013
; Backlund & Hendrix,
2013
; Wouters et al.,
2013
; Tsekleves et al.,
2014
; Fu et al.,
2016
). The researchers refer to serious games since they are basically considered as games with educational orientation and not with just entertaining ones.
Another important element we have identified is whether games should be fully or partially integrated into the learning process. Most of the researchers agree that games should be treated mainly as supplementary elements (Sitzmann,
2011
) since full integration requires high-quality mechanisms, students’ engagement, and instructors’ support. In other cases, the integration of games in the curriculum could either function as a supplement to existing teaching techniques or as a partial substitute for traditional teaching methods (Rutten et al.,
2012
). Moreover, games could even be fully integrated for achieving better learning outcomes (Lameras et al.,
2016
) because games add diversity in educational teaching modules. Nevertheless, the integration of games depends on instructors’ contribution and the way they design and incorporate games in their teaching. This means that instructors should be equipped with knowledge and experience, and be aware of providing guidance to students as regards the proper way of playing games.
The beneficial contribution of game-based learning is broadly identified by the majority of previous reviewers, especially regarding cognitive outcomes. Results indicate that games can be as effective as traditional learning modes, revealing their effectiveness in promoting knowledge acquisition (Smetana & Bell,
2012
; Backlund & Hendrix,
2013
; Clark et al.,
2015
; Warren et al.,
2016
), as well as content understanding and concept learning (Connoly et al.,
2012
; Li & Tsai,
2013
; Fu et al.,
2016
). Additionally, students achieve their learning goals through playfulness and problem-based learning (Tsekleves et al.,
2014
), thus leading to self-efficacy and transfer of learning (Gegenfurtner et al.,
2014
).
Another substantial impact emerged is the effectiveness of games not only in the cognitive domain but also in the affective and behavioural domains (Ritzhaupt et al.,
2014
; Shin et al.,
2015
; Tsekleves et al.,
2014
; Fu et al.,
2016
; Carenys & Moya,
2016
). The affective domain is thoroughly discussed by the reviewers. In particular, games influence students’ motivation, engagement, and satisfaction of the game-based learning. Regarding behavioural outcomes, few reviews have been conducted, showing that games offer a plethora of opportunities for collaborative learning, enhance interactivity and feedback among players, and develop social and soft skills as well. Some other studies contradict these findings, in a way that they do not reveal positive effects of games (Young et al.,
2012
; Girard et al.,
2013
; Merchant et al.,
2014
), or reveal a rather neutral effect (de Smale et al.,
2015
). In these reviews, games and simulations appear to have some or no positive effects on knowledge and skills acquisition when comparing with traditional instructional methods.
Research method
Research selection
The authors developed a pre-defined review protocol to answer the research questions, specifically aimed at minimising researcher bias. The literature review was carried out between July and October 2016 and followed the design stages described below.
The reviewed papers are identified through keywords in referenced electronic databases, such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycInfo, PsycArticles Fulltext Search, InterDok, ProQuest, Scopus, BEI, and SearchPlus. The keywords for learning outcomes are a combination of the term
games
or
simulations
paired with the term
higher education
, employing the Boolean operator “AND”. Additional keywords for learning outcomes are
learning objectives, learning goals, learning objectives and effects
. Keywords for platform and delivery methods include
computer-based, web-based, digital, virtual, online, and technology.
Keywords for games and simulations are
educational games, business simulations, role-playing simulations, game-based learning, video games,
and
serious games
. Moreover, the Boolean operator “OR” is employed to combine all these keywords. The study sets the broadest range of keywords, so as not to limit the scope of related articles.
Furthermore, the researchers conducted a comprehensive database search in bibliographic indices for the data selection. The search is related to a variety of scientific fields of study, including Education, Psychology, Information Technology, Management, and other scientific areas (e.g., Engineering, STEM, Health, etc).
Assessment and extraction
The dataset consists of journal articles referring to games, simulations or learning in their title and/or abstract. The researchers piloted and evaluated their selection criteria based on prior studies. The study selection process was conducted in two separate phases: a) the researchers, working independently, initially, and, subsequently, together, screened the titles and abstracts for inclusion criteria, and b) in the event of disagreement or insufficient information, they carried out a thorough consideration of the body of the articles (i.e. methodology and results), again independently, first, and, then, together, resulting in consensus. Then, whether to include the text or not was discussed, based on pre-determined criteria. The inclusion criteria used are as follows:
Only empirical articles across a variety of study designs may be included, so as to achieve rich data.
The participants should be over the age of 18 (e.g., students in higher education, college students, instructors, etc.)
Articles that provide an evaluation of student learning outcomes (via the use of games for pedagogical purposes) may also be included.
The resources should, mainly, consist of journal articles and conference papers, which, due to the peer review process, ensure a high quality of material to examine. Existing meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews should be included as well, in order to cross-validate the review findings.
The articles should be available in either English or French.
The articles should adhere to the objective of the study and the definition of the terms
games
and
simulations
as pedagogical applications.
Studies containing samples from higher education institutions should also be included. Conversely, research on the effects of games in primary or secondary education should be discarded.
The review should include games and simulations used in traditional, as well as in online environments.
Only peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2010 and 2016 should be included, as the intention is to include the most current research.
Several exclusion criteria, listed below, were also applied in this study:
Non-empirical studies or studies which solely describe the design of a learning environment.
Participants who are younger than 18 years old.
Non-GBL tools and entertainment games.
Book chapters -not only are books difficult to search for on databases, they are, also, hard to access as full texts. Additionally, books are not always subject to the same peer review process as scientific articles. Dissertations, theses, editorials, book reviews and reports are also excluded for similar reasons.
Articles that cannot be accessed as full texts are excluded.
Articles that do not match the research objectives.
Research focused on types of education other than higher education.
As mentioned above, articles published before 2010.
The following figure illustrates the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig.
2
):
Fig. 2
The inclusion and exclusion criteria
Full size image
Application of these criteria resulted in an initial dataset, yielding 8859 studies, published between 2010 and 2016. The selected papers are derived from 67 academic journals representing a variety of disciplines. Most papers come from the scientific journal “Computers & Education”, while “British Journal of Educational Technology”, and “Simulation & Gaming” were the next two journals appearing with the most frequency. In the final stage, several meetings were organized between researchers to discuss the findings, and to decide on presentation.
The results show a steady increase in published papers discussing games from 2012 onwards. After systematically reviewing their abstracts, a final shortlist of 628 potential full text articles emerged. Two hundred and seventeen out of the 628 were excluded, primarily, due to undesirable focus (e.g. theoretical scenarios for using simulations in education). For each of the remaining 411 studies, the researchers identified and recorded some basic themes, for example, types of learning outcomes, effect or impact of game and simulation methods on learning goals, participants and settings, research questions, research methodology and results. Of these, 123 papers, which are found to contribute data, are selected for the review, whereas the remaining 288 articles are excluded, due to the fact that they are written in a language that the researchers do not understand, or because they are focused on a field other than higher education. The majority of these articles are published in scientific journals or conference proceedings, whereas 25 studies are either meta-analyses and/or systematic reviews. An outline of the entire review is depicted in the following figure (Fig.
3
):

Data analysis and synthesis
The identified articles are analysed using a qualitative content analysis technique, which leads to a coding scheme, including a main category, three sub-categories and several associated topics related to the main categories. The researchers unanimously agree upon the coding that emerged from the analysis of the reviewed papers. To ensure inter-rater reliability (p) with respect to the quality of article coding procedures, a small random sample (
n
= 20) of the selected articles is coded in duplicate. The calculated reliability exceeds 93%, which is a high quality of agreement across coding categories. Furthermore, a review of mixed-methodology studies provides high-quality evidence, due to a combination of quantitative and qualitative elements in terms of methodological triangulation.
The researchers examined the studies from varying viewpoints. Firstly, they analysed the data set characteristics, such as the continent on which the studies are conducted, the subject discipline, the methodological research design, the types of games and simulations identified, and the time period in which the majority of the studies took place. The emphasis is on the analysis, measures, and design of the quantitative methodology (experimental, quasi-experimental, pre-test, post-test surveys, etc.), as well as the qualitative methods used in the reviewed surveys.
To sum up, the review studies are selected through a systematic process with pre-arranged criteria. There is no intended bias applied to the selected studies, and although the majority of studies come from Europe, this is simply the result of the systematic selection process.
Results
Data set characteristics
When analysing the data, the researchers came across some interesting characteristics. Other than the meta-analytic studies and review research, the locations of the remaining surveys are as follows: 33% conducted in Europe, 22% in Asia, and 18% in the USA, whereas 24% of the articles do not directly mention a location (Fig.
4
). Most of the articles come from the USA, the UK, and the Netherlands.

With respect to genre, there is a diverse representation of games and simulations. The most prominent game genre identified in the relevant literature seems to be simulation games in general, that is to say, virtual/online games or simulations, computer-based learning, role-playing games, serious games, and business simulation games. This representation is illustrated below (Fig.
5
):

With respect to the busiest publication period, the majority of studies that meet the inclusion criteria were published between 2013 and 2016, as shown in the following bar chart (Fig.
6
). This finding demonstrates a notable trend amongst researchers discussing the topic of games and simulations in recent years, due to increased awareness of the use of technological games in higher education.

The data also represents a wide range of subject areas. Some cover multiple areas, for example Engineering, Management, Science, Law, Social Sciences and Humanities (Tao et al.,
2015
), or even just two areas, such as Biology and Computer Sciences (Yang & Chang,
2013
), while others refer to only one academic discipline. The subject areas are sorted into larger categories, with the most common area being Business Management and Marketing. The results are shown in the figure below (Fig.

Subject disciplene
Full size image
The reviewed articles include data from 99 samples and 20,406 participants, which is a considerably large grouping. The population tested in the literature review ranges from 5 participants in small qualitative studies (Ke et al.,
2015
) to 5071 participants in extensive quantitative quasi-experimental research (Lu et al.,
2014
). Most of the participants are young undergraduate, graduate or post-graduate students, and faculty members. The studies consistently indicate a good gender balance in participants. In some studies, there is both student and faculty participation (Kapralos et al.,
2011
; Felicia,
2011
; Hess & Gunter,
2013
; Hämäläinen & Oksanen,
2014
; Beuk,
2015
; Crocco,
2016
), whereas in others, only instructors are chosen as participants (Tanner,
2012
; Badea,
2015
; Franciosi,
2016
). On the whole, most studies use students as participants.
Procedures and research methodologies
Most studies use either an experimental or a quasi-experimental design employing a pre-test and/or a post-test evaluation, with four using only a pre-test questionnaire, and six using only post-test evaluations. The effects of games and simulations on learning outcomes are measured through calculating the difference between pre-test and post-test scores of the experimental or quasi-experimental design. More specifically, the researchers compare the increases in scores between control and experimental groups to evaluate the effectiveness of using the tested games and simulations. The studies include longitudinal surveys (e.g. Hainey,
2011
) conducted for a specified number of years, whereas others are comparative studies (e.g., Boeker,
2013
; Poikela,
2015
).
Researchers use quantitative methods in the majority of studies (68.6%), while13.1% use qualitative methodology. Some studies follow a mixed research methodology (nearly 18.2%), providing pragmatic perceptions and methodological triangulation of the results. The measures utilized in quantitative studies include knowledge questionnaires, as well as academic, evaluation, and cognitive tests, while in qualitative studies the methods used include interviews, case studies, observations and focus groups.
The studies portray a variety of time periods spent playing games and simulations: some of the participants interact with games over a single session, while others are involved in the gaming process for several weeks or even months (e.g., Yang & Chang,
2013
; Woo,
2014
). The studies include multi-player games (e.g., Silvia,
2012
; Yin,
2013
), as well as single-player games.
Learning outcomes of games and simulations
In the present review, keeping in mind the aforementioned research questions (p.3), the researchers break down their findings in relation to the learning outcomes of games and simulations into three categories, namely cognitive, behavioural, and affective outcomes. A map of the emerging concepts, which will be further discussed, is illustrated below (Fig.

Cognitive outcomes
Many reviewed studies discuss the impact of GBL activities in learner knowledge acquisition and conceptual understanding (Hainey et al.,
2011
; Connolly et al.,
2012
; Fu et al.,
2016
; Geithner & Menzel,
2016
). There has been an impact evaluation across subject disciplines, such as Computer Science (Strycker,
2016
), Engineering (Chaves et al.,
2015
), Physics (Adams,
2016
), Medicine (Dankbaar,
2016
), Nursing (Sarabia-Cobo,
2016
), Management (Geithner & Menzel,
2016
), Political Sciences (Jones & Bursens,
2015
), Education (Ke,
2015
), Languages (Franciosi,
2016
), and Social Sciences (Cózar-Gutiérrez & Sáez-López,
2016
).
Knowledge acquisition
Cognitive outcomes refer “to the knowledge structures relevant to perceiving games as artefacts for linking knowledge-oriented activities with cognitive outcomes” (Lameras et al.,
2016
, p. 10). Tasks framed as games and simulations are deployed to develop a diverse range of cognitive skills, such as deep learning (Vos & Brennan,
2010
; Young et al.,
2012
; Erhel & Jamet,
2013
; Crocco et al.,
2016
), critical thinking and scientific reasoning (Beckem & Watkins,
2012
; Halpern et al.,
2012
; Ahmad,
2013
), action-directed learning (Lu et al.,
2014
), transformative learning (Kleinheskel,
2014
), decision-making (Tiwari,
2014
), knowledge acquisition and content understanding (Terzidou,
2012
; Elias,
2014
; Fu et al.,
2016
), spatial abilities (Adams et al.,
2016
), and problem solving (Liu,
2011
; Lancaster,
2014
).
The effect of games and simulations on learning remains a controversial issue amongst researchers in the field, as it will be further confirmed in this article. Some reviewed studies indicate improved learning, while others show no positive effect on knowledge and skill acquisition compared to traditional learning methods. The value of simulations can be examined from the perspective of content change as discussed in Kovalic and Kuo’s study (
2012
). Simulations are directly linked to the course content and students are given the opportunity to apply and better understand theoretical concepts. Additionally, simulations provide an environment in which students can experiment with different strategies, adopt different roles, and take charge of their own decisions by assuming responsibility. The latter issue is discussed at length by Liu et al. (
2011
), who find that, when solving problems, students are more likely to learn via playing a game than via a traditional learning experience.
Serious gaming, especially given the context of enthusiastic students, has proved to be an effective training method in domains such as medical education, for example, in clinical decision-making and patient interaction (de Wit-Zuurendonk & Oei,
2011
). Similarly, Kleinheskel (
2014
) illustrates the importance of designing self-reflective simulating activities for nursing students, and aligning such design with cognitive outcomes. When students self-reflect on simulated clinical experiences, they add to their existing knowledge, and apply new knowledge to transformative learning. Poikela et al. (
2015
), in a simulated nursing procedure, compare a computer-based simulation with a lecture to examine the meaningful learning students may achieve via the two teaching methods. They conclude that students who participate in the computer simulation are more likely to report meaningful learning outcomes than those taking the lecture, due to the strong presence of reflection-based activities and metacognitive themes. Similar results are present in Chen, (
2015
), survey in which both solitary players and collaborative groups achieve equally positive learning outcomes in a game. Students significantly improve judging by their pre- and post-test assessments, which indicates that the gaming experience affects their overall performance, and, most likely, promotes conceptual understanding. Moreover, collaborative GBL allows students to re-construct and co-construct knowledge, thus encouraging problem-solving through peer discussion.
Challenging games enhance participant performance (Wang & Chen,
2010
; Gold,
2016
). This finding is supported by von Wangenheim, (
2012
), who analyse the cognitive dimension of an educational game focusing on memory, understanding and conceptual application. The validity of micro-simulation games is identified by participants in Lukosch, (
2016
), research who evaluate a specific microgame as an excellent instrument for enhancing situated and experiential learning by transferring knowledge to an actual situation at the workplace. The results comply with those of Riemer and Schrader (
2015
), where the application of comprehension and transfer of knowledge are best achieved using simulations.
Furthermore, the impact of game-based learning on learning performance has been observed by numerous researchers across diverse subjects, as reported above (Zacharia & Olympiou,
2011
; Rutten et al.,
2012
; Beckem & Watkins,
2012
; Boeker et al.,
2013
; Shin et al.,
2015
; Hou,
2015
; Chen et al.,
2015
; Tao et al.,
2015
). For instance, Divjak and Tomić (
2011
) provide evidence that computer games impact mathematical learning, revealing the positive effect of games on student learning outcomes. Reviews by Young et al. (
2012
) confirm the effectiveness of using videogames on History, Languages, and Physical Education. The analysis of four experimental virtual conditions in pre- and post-test assessments reveal that virtual experimentation promotes conceptual understanding in Physics students (Zacharia & Olympiou,
2011
). A 3D visualisation and simulation laboratory activity on protein structure is more effective than traditional instruction modules, as described in White, (
2010
), research resulting in students preferring to work with visualized simulations.
Simulation games also positively affect clinical practice situations. “The Ward”, a simulation game in Stanley and Latimer’s (
2011
) research proves to be an enjoyable and valuable learning tool in addressing clinical skill practice, nursing practice knowledge, critical thinking and decision-making. Vos and Brennan (
2010
) highlight the effectiveness of marketing simulation games, where students perceive simulations as an enjoyable learning approach, contributing to decision-making, as well as other valuable knowledge and skills, a finding consistent with Tiwari et al. (
2014
) survey. Swanson et al. (
2011
) created a rubric to measure the effectiveness of teaching strategies in nursing education. The experimental post-test assessment survey aims to evaluate the effects of three teaching strategies on the outcome of performance and retention of intervention activities, student satisfaction, self-confidence and practical educational preferences. Results reveal significantly higher retention scores compared to the first assessment, indicating that high scores in the improved rubric are related to the interactivity of the simulation scenario.
Nevertheless, it should not be taken for granted that students consistently prefer virtual learning settings to more traditional face-to-face environments (Hummel et al.,
2011
). Serious games concerning cognitive perceptions show varying results. For example, simulations are shown to support the comprehension and application of knowledge, albeit less effectively than quizzes and adventures (Riemer & Schrader,
2015
). In Fu et al. (
2016
) review, despite GBL providing a motivating and enjoyable experience, there is a lack of strong evidence to show that games lead to effective learning outcomes. In some cases, there is inconsistency in student views regarding the integration of online games as a positive learning method (Bolliger,
2015
). Similar views are supported by some researchers, who acknowledge students’ and educators’ hesitation towards virtual simulations and serious games, but they insist on the inclusion of games into course material, and on instructors’ familiarization with their use (Kapralos et al.,
2011
).
Perceptual skills
Other studies confirm the power of games and simulations in developing cognition abilities, especially in the instances of virtual simulations enhancing complex cognitive skills (Helle et al.,
2011
; Siewiorek,
2013
), such as self-assessment (Arias Aranda,
2010
), or higher-order thinking (Crocco et al.,
2016
). These are meta-cognitive skills, regarded as essential elements of in-depth learning. The incorporation of game mechanisms into simulations is widely recognised by researchers as beneficial, especially regarding laboratory tasks, where simulation scenarios urge students towards problem-solving and, reflection, thus achieving metacognitive outcomes (Hou & Li,
2014
; Hou,
2015
). Kikot, (
2013
) concur with the above researchers, stating that students perceive simulation-based learning (SBL) environments positively when asked to achieve dynamic learning outcomes, including thinking, interpreting, and associative skills.
Silvia (
2012
) also references cognitive and metacognitive outcomes derived from a multi-role simulation. The simulation helps students apply the concepts they learn in class by connecting the theoretical issues with real-world situations, thus developing their analytical skills, and through comparing different viewpoints, which leads to enhanced critical thinking. Students use the interactive nature of simulations to develop arguments, make judgements and evaluate situations. More importantly, simulations encourage students to develop self-awareness. Similarly, Cela-Ranilla, (
2014
) conducted a study in which students display a tendency to perform better in analytical work, such as monitoring, planning and assessment rather than in action-based work. Wouters et al. (
2013
), on the other hand, find serious games to be more effective in terms of learning and retention.
Learners can also actively participate in a web-based simulation to facilitate immersion and reflection, leading to deeper understanding of the content (Helle et al.,
2011
). A simulation framework can facilitate learning in terms of flow experience and learning strategies. Indeed, in a study conducted by Li, Cheng, and Liu (
2013
), the framework helps students lacking background knowledge to balance challenge and skill perceptions, while for students with average to advanced levels of knowledge, it facilitates the learning experience by either reducing the challenge perception or promoting the skill perception. Along the same lines, Pasin and Giroux (
2011
), analyse the mistakes students make in simulations using an empirical prototype. Results show that, although simple decision-making skills are easily acquired through conventional teaching methods, simulation games are useful tools for mastering managerial skills, such as complex and dynamic decision-making. Lin and Tu (
2012
) also confirm that simulations enable students to train themselves in decision-making.
Instructors’ engagement
Students are challenged to develop interpersonal, analytical and creative skills, discouraging absenteeism, feelings of boredom and reluctance, leading to academic achievement. However, simulations not only exhibit positive effects in the learning experience of the student, but, also, do so for instructors, as well, in the context of teaching experience. For academics, simulations raise the level of performance, encouraging students to be more alert and attentive during class activities (Navidad,
2013
), and thus to achieve better learning outcomes. In this vein, instructors are urged to design simulations to be as challenging as possible to stimulate student interest in interacting with the simulation as well as with their peers. Felicia (
2011
) denotes that instructors agree with students in acknowledging the educational benefits of video games, such as an understanding of difficult concepts, improvement of spatial awareness and analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving strategies. To enable them to do so, instructors emphasize the importance of clearly expressed learning goals to guide students when using simulations in an online instructional technology course (Kovalik & Kuo,
2012
).
Even setting aside the potential learning benefits derived from participation in GBL, a stronger connection between games and curricula remains to be forged, as well as the application of more dynamic academic challenges, so as to better adapt to the knowledge of diverse learners (Pløhn,
2013
). Following such reasoning, as indicated in the literature, faculty plays a key role in achieving learning goals via the use of games and simulations. The instructor role correlates with the demand for abstract learning concepts. In their meta-analysis, Wouters and Van Oostendorp (
2013
) show how instructors, acting in a facilitating and supporting role, can foster learning, particularly in selecting and discussing new information and where higher order skills are involved in the learning outcomes. Similarly, instructors can monitor student behaviour and evaluate not only the capabilities, but also the attitudes of tomorrow’s higher education managers during the decision-making process. Rutten et al. (
2012
) focus in their literature review on the level of instructional support in GBL, and suggest that a pedagogical framework for the application of computer simulations in education requires a corresponding integration of the educator’s role.
Behavioural outcomes
Behavioural objectives for higher education students refer to the enhancement of teamwork and improvement in relational abilities (Ranchhod,
2014
), as well as stronger organisational skills, adaptability and the ability to resolve conflicts (Vos & Brennan,
2010
).
Social skills/teamwork
Simulation games are often seen as powerful tools in promoting teamwork and team dynamics (Stanley & Latimer,
2011
; Tiwari et al.,
2014
; Lin,
2016
; Wang,
2016
), collaboration (Hanning,
2012
), social and emotional skills (Ahmad et al.,
2013
), and other soft skills, including project management, self-reflection, and leadership skills (Siewiorek,
2012
; Wang et al.,
2016
), which are acquired through a reality-based scenarios with action-oriented activities (Geithner & Menzel,
2016
).
In a Spanish management course, simulations enabled students to build pivotal capacities, such as management abilities and team working to enable the success of future managers (Arias Aranda et al.,
2010
). A computer simulation at a university in Taiwan led to comparatively higher learning gains against traditional teaching through collaborative laboratory activities (Shieh,
2010
), by facilitating students to carry out more active learning and improving their conceptual understanding. Simulation scenarios provide improved social and communication skills, which lead to the enhancement of student knowledge (Sarabia-Cobo et al.,
2016
).
Additionally, collaboration is considered an essential element in the learning process (Elias,
2014
). The findings of Hummel et al. (
2011
) reveal that serious online games improve the quality of learning when it comes to problem-based situations in the workplace by using active collaboration. For this reason, faculty members are urged to create learning environments to support active participation by students in the educational process. Moreover, according to the constructivist approach, the instructor’s role is a significant factor in empowering groups to construct knowledge in a collaborative manner (Hämäläinen & Oksanen,
2014
). The instructors engage higher education students in the process of formulating hypotheses, interpreting context, providing explanations, and describing observations, by designing and implementing a collaborative and interactive GBL environment. In Yin et al.’s study (
2013
), students react positively to participatory simulations, due to the belief that the system helps them advance their conceptual understanding effectively through scaffolding, discussion, and reflection. Participants in Cózar-Gutiérrez and Sáez-López’s study (
2016
), while stating that video games are non-essential tools in an educational context, nevertheless, value GBL as an immersive environment that facilitates increased activity and student engagement.
Teamwork, however, seems to be a controversial issue in Costa, (
2014
) which evaluates improvement of knowledge sharing. Some learners consider teamwork as a means to facilitate decision making in a game, while others express dissatisfaction due to their peers, be it the latter’s reluctance to take on responsibility or poor negotiation capabilities. Research by Bolliger et al. (
2015
) similarly indicates that some learners remain hesitant, as they feel the use of games may actually decrease opportunities for communication with peers and instructors. Merchant et al. (
2014
) conclude that student performance is enhanced when playing individually rather than in a group.
Interaction and feedback
In GBL methods, meaningful feedback is a key factor in students achieving the objectives, as well as in being encouraged to reflect on misunderstandings and to transfer learning to new educational contexts (Swanson et al.,
2011
). In the current study, the scope is to investigate learner-learner interaction and social feedback through game mechanics. Higher education students evaluate games and simulations focusing on behavioural change and improvement of interactive abilities. The computer game DELIVER! for example, is evaluated very positively by students due to its focus on active student participation and overall positive impact on social interaction (von Wangenheim et al.,
2012
). Simulations provide visual feedback, encouraging active exploration of the student’s own understanding, enabling a move beyond knowing-in action and beginning to reflect-on and in-action during training, resulting in the contextual application of prior knowledge (Söderström,
2014
). Real-time feedback in simulation games enables students to clearly define the objectives and expectations in the interactive environment, leading to a reduction in anxiety and uncertainty, thus encouraging better performance (Nkhoma et al.,
2014
).
The literature extensively documents the interaction between behavioural outcomes, learning performance and communication especially in Online Distance Learning (ODL). Indeed, regular feedback on student performance during DGBL facilitates deep learning (Erhel & Jamet,
2013
). A survey conducted by Chen, (
2010
) shows that online games can be social and interactive technologies, helping students form friendships with their peers and providing multiple types of interaction.
Ke et al. (
2015
) stress the importance of player interaction, indicating that the inherent interaction between players and their gaming-situated learning environment supplies structured challenges and feedback. Huang, (
2010
) share the same view, confirming that, due to the necessity of receiving feedback from peers and the game itself, increased interaction opportunities arise in game-play, adding that interaction is a decisive factor in the construction of knowledge (Seng & Yatim,
2014
). In a survey conducted by Denholm et al. (
2012
), students report improved team working through the use of serious games. They attribute this to receiving feedback, and stressing that even conflict is often considered valuable as it brings diverse views to the fore.
To conclude, the main body of literature explores the impact of games and simulations on learning outcomes on the behavioural level, especially when students are involved in interactive and participatory simulation tasks. The majority of studies reveal a positive effect on behavioural outcomes, concluding that students benefit from appropriate feedback, and reflection through game-based communication activities.
Affective outcomes
Many studies highlight the affective outcomes of using games and simulations in the learning process. The majority of them includes student engagement (Auman,
2011
; Hainey et al.,
2011
; Lin & Tu,
2012
; Kikot et al.,
2013
; Lu et al.,
2014
; Ke et al.,
2015
), motivation (Liu et al.,
2011
; Liao & Wang,
2011
; Costa et al.,
2014
; Lukosch et al.,
2016
), and satisfaction (Cvetić et al.,
2013
; Dzeng,
2014
; Lancaster,
2014
; Sarabia-Cobo et al.,
2016
).
Motivation and engagement
Engagement and motivation are major factors in enhancing higher education learning objectives (Connolly et al.,
2012
; Erhel & Jamet,
2013
; Ke et al.,
2015
; Nadolny & Halabi,
2015
). Motivation is considered a central factor in the majority of reviewed studies (Felicia,
2011
; Ljungkvist & Mozelius,
2012
; von Wangenheim et al.,
2012
; Bellotti et al.,
2013
; Hannig et al.,
2013
; Ahmad et al.,
2013
; Pløhn,
2013
; Li et al.,
2013
; Denholm et al.,
2012
; Dzeng et al.,
2014
; Lancaster,
2014
; Ariffin et al.,
2014
; Bolliger et al.,
2015
; Cózar-Gutiérrez, & Sáez-López,
2016
; Dankbaar et al.,
2016
; Fu et al.,
2016
). Some results suggest the effectiveness of GBL in motivating and achieving learning goals can be found at the lower levels of Bloom’s taxonomy (e.g. Connolly et al.,
2012
). In the context of digital SBL environments, other motivational dimensions are highlighted, such as self-efficacy (Sitzmann,
2011
), in conjunction with the transfer of learning (Gegenfurtner et al.,
2014
).
Motivation is a combination of elements such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction, which can increase germane cognitive loads. Chang, (
2010
) examine the effects of motivation in an instructional simulation game, called SIMPLE. According to the post-game evaluation, student motivation comes from peer learning and user cooperation. Moreover, when instructors teach strategy, this enhances student motivation and engagement, encouraging acceptance of the game, and leading to stronger interest in course-directed learning. Thus, teachers should create a flexible learning environment, giving due consideration to peer interaction, learning motivation, pedagogical support and encouragement to help students develop their autonomy and retain an interest in learning.
Another important element contributing to affective outcomes is challenge. Hainey et al. (
2011
) find the presence of a challenge to be the top ranked motivation for online game players, while recognition is the lowest ranked motivation regardless of gender or amount of players in the game. Gamers in a multiplayer environment tend to report competition, cooperation, recognition, fantasy and curiosity when playing games, while online players experience challenge, cooperation, recognition and control. By contrast, fanatical computer game players experience disappointment and a lack of challenge, as they tend to value the technical aspect over the challenges presented by game play. In Hess and Gunter’s survey (
2013
), students in a game-based course are motivated, because of the positive social interaction they experience while playing the game; this intrinsic motivation is positively correlated to student performance. Computer games can thus be seen as a learning tool motivating players to acquire many competences. Connolly et al. (
2012
) share the same view, seeing the role of challenge as a predictive factor with respect to game engagement and achievement. Similarly, in Ke et al.’s study (
2015
), the game-play actions include optimal challenge expectation for the user. These results can also be seen in Badea (
2015
), who concludes that the majority of participants in her study acknowledge the highly motivating quality of games, which are complemented by the relaxed class atmosphere when games are used.
However, despite the benefits reaped from the implementation of games and simulations concerning affective outcomes, some researchers underline that motivation is not always related to GBL, emphasizing cases where students who use games in solitary or collaborative environments experience no significant difference in terms of learning motivation (Chen et al.,
2015
). There are indeed cases where serious games are no more motivating than conventional instructional methods (Wouters et al.,
2013
). In Cela-Ranilla et al.’s survey (
2014
), despite the suitability of the 3D simulation environment, students do not feel highly motivated or particularly engaged, mostly because they prefer analysis to actions in the particular learning process.
Faculty role
The benefits of a pedagogical shift from a teacher-focused and lecture-based classroom to a student-centred, active-learning environment through the adoption of simulation-based strategies to achieve engagement are relevant to both students and instructors (Auman,
2011
). There is a progression in student emotion from uncertainty and nervousness to satisfaction and excitement within the gaming experience. Auman (
2011
), as an instructor, provides a positive description: she is drawn in by student enthusiasm, her interest in the material is reinvigorated, she feels empowered in her teaching, and ready to guide her class. In this context, it’s easy to see how instructors ought to play a significant role in motivating and engaging students to achieve learning goals. De Porres and Livingston (
2016
) concur with Auman (
2011
), as their study also indicates increased levels of excitement in doctoral students studying Computer Science, when evaluated in a post-test intervention.
Faculty acting as motivators are key in engaging students in the learning process, working to ensure focus on pre-existing knowledge, as well as to transfer knowledge to game settings (Lameras et al.,
2016
), to reward students for their effort, and support them by providing continuous guidance and pathways for further consideration. The quality of the teacher/facilitator has a strong influence on the learning satisfaction of the students. Also, instructors should facilitate and engage students via in-game discussion forums to help overcome misconceptions, and to lead the game-based learning. The way instructors interact, facilitate and motivate students to construct GBL experiences depends on the design stage, particularly on the way games are incorporated into the curriculum in a traditional course (Wouters et al.,
2013
). This is because motivation exhibits a significant correlation with cognitive and skill performance (Woo,
2014
). In research conducted by Franciosi (
2016
), despite faculty acknowledging the beneficial impact of games on student motivation, they nevertheless, remain doubtful about the effectiveness of games in learning outcomes, thus resulting in neutral attitudes. Interestingly, although instructors perceive simulations as engaging learning technologies, they do not however consider them superior to traditional teaching methods (Tanner et al.,
2012
).
Another aspect, less frequently discussed in the relevant literature, is students’ performing self-assessments with regard to effective learning, as seen in Jones and Bursens study (
2015
). This ability is supported by constructivism, since simulations are developed in an active learning environment, where faculty act more as facilitators rather than as instructors and students are provided with feedback to carry out their self-assessments.
Attitudes and satisfaction
A vital element in achieving learning goals is the relationship between motivational processing and the outcome processing (satisfaction), especially in an online instructional game, as seen in the experiment carried out by Huang et al. (
2010
). There seems to be a significant relation between these two variables, which suggests that designers of DGBL need to consider extrinsic rewards to achieve motivational development and satisfaction. Learning satisfaction is strongly correlated with student motivation and attitude towards GBL before the game, with actual enjoyment and effort during the game, as well as with the quality of the teacher/facilitator (Mayer,
2013
). Specifically, students with a higher level of inner motivation and positive attitude towards GBL are more likely to have higher learning expectations, and to experience more satisfaction in their GBL participation.
In general, most studies report that students develop a positive attitude toward the pedagogical adoption of games and simulations in education (Divjak & Tomić,
2011
; Bekebrede,
2011
; Ibrahim et al.,
2011
; Beckem & Watkins,
2012
; Tanner et al.,
2012
; von Wangenheim et al.,
2012
; Halpern et al.,
2012
; Terzidou et al.,
2012
; Hanning et al.,
2013
; Giovanello,
2013
; Cvetić et al.,
2013
; Kovalik & Kuo,
2012
; Li & Tsai,
2013
; Hainey et al.,
2011
; Boeker et al.,
2013
; Nkhoma et al.,
2014
; Costa et al.,
2014
; Chaves et al.,
2015
; Riemer & Schrader,
2015
; Angelini,
2016
; Geithner & Menzel,
2016
). The participants in Dudzinski et al. (
2013
) respond positively towards a serious web-based game, describing the experience as interesting, stimulating and helpful, as well as a valuable addition to their pharmacy curriculum. Other students perceive simulation games as fun, but not particularly useful as an instructional method compared to lectures, and about equally useful as case discussions (Beuk,
2015
). In another study, the majority of students show a positive attitude towards games, positing that they make subjects more fun and provide more opportunities for learning (Ibrahim et al.,
2011
). This finding is consistent with Bekebrede et al. (
2011
) on the perceptions of Dutch students belonging to the “net generation”, who have been raised with technology-based games. Data reveals student preference towards active, collaborative and technology-rich learning via digital games that bring added value to the educational process.
For students, satisfaction is a deciding factor in their decision to continue using such learning methods (Liao & Wang,
2011
; Liao,
2015
). Terzidou et al. (
2012
) discuss affective outcomes, especially the way interviewees feel before and after their participation in the game. Prior to participating, the interviewees report feelings of entertainment, fascination, and satisfaction before their participation in the game, which increase after use, indicating that participants find the use of 3D virtual game appealing.
Chen et al. (
2010
) reveal that the majority of students show negative feelings about online gaming. Shieh et al.’s (
2010
) mixed methodology research reveals that experimental groups show positive attitudes toward an innovative learning environment and outperform the control groups (in conventional classes). Some studies depict either neutral effects (Rajan et al.,
2013
; Beuk,
2015
; Bolliger et al.,
2015
; Dankbaar et al.,
2016
; Strycker,
2016
) or negative attitudes towards game use in the learning experience (Jiménez-Munguía & Luna-Reyes,
2012
). Students experience more anxiety and boredom during conventional courses, which acts as an impediment to acquiring substantial problem-solving skills. The educational benefits of GBL are particularly apparent in subjects over which students report greater anxiety, where it can be proven that increased enjoyment levels correlate positively with improvements in deep learning and higher-order thinking (Crocco et al.,
2016
). Liarokapis, (
2010
) show Computer Science students evaluating a serious online game, and finding it a valuable pedagogical tool, which is both useful and entertaining.
Genre/familiarity issues
Students achieving high scores respond more positively to online games compared to low achieving students. Regarding genre perceptions, male students express more enthusiasm towards digital gaming than female students, or at least spend more time playing computer games compared to girls (Hainey et al.,
2011
). This may be due to the fact that boys tend to be more familiar with computers and web-based technologies. Girls may choose to avoid digital game-based learning methods, due to their negative preconceptions about gaming, preventing them from harnessing the positive aspects of online gaming (Chen et al.,
2010
). These studies indicate a difference in perception based on gender when engaging in DGBL environments. However, research by Riemer and Schrader (
2015
) concluded that female students reported a more positive attitude and perception of affective quality compared to the male students. Also, high assessment scores in web-based games depend on the professional experience of the players. Unexpectedly, in Dzeng et al.’s experimental survey (
2014
), despite the high test scores achieved in both web-based and paper-based games, students without work experience achieve the highest post-test scores, probably because they are more familiar with using technological tools. The experiments in Erhel and Jamet’s study (

) indicate that serious games promote learning and motivation, provided they include features that prompt learners to actively process the educational content.
To sum up, games and simulations lead to improved affective outcomes for university students such as attitudes, motivation, emotional involvement, self-efficacy and satisfaction. A growing body of literature supports the positive attitude shown by students towards games and simulations, as they consider them essential instructional tools that provide motivation and engagement in an active learning environment.
Discussion
Research interest in the incorporation of games and simulations in higher education is constantly developing (Girard et al.,
2013
). The pedagogical shift, from lecture-centred to student-centred environments and the increasing use of games as innovative learning technologies, calls for a transformation in higher education. In this respect, games and simulations are expected to play a significant role in the learning process. In the present study, the focus is on the positive effects of games and simulations on university students’ learning outcomes. The reviewed papers are diverse in terms of research objectives, theoretical background, methodological avenues adopted, game genres, scientific domain or delivery platform, and various perspectives concerning cognitive, behavioural and affective outcomes employed. Many articles (
n
= 123) are identified, providing either empirical results or offering meta-analytic evidence.
There seems to be a lack of shared definitions or taxonomy necessary for a common classification, which, therefore, results in terminological ambiguity (Klabbers,
2009
). The majority of GBL researchers compare the effectiveness of implementing web-based learning games to conventional instructional options (Shin et al.,
2015
).
Mapping the results, empirical evidence is identified with respect to cognitive learning outcomes including knowledge acquisition, conceptual application, content understanding and action-directed learning. Games and simulations are educational interventions, which create a supportive environment in which students may acquire knowledge across subjects and disciplines. Students have the opportunity to better understand theoretical concepts, provided that games are used as a supplement in traditional lecture-based courses. Additionally, simulations are often perceived as enjoyable learning tools, which require active and collaborative participation and contribute to the improvement of critical thinking and reasoning, higher-order- and metacognitive thinking. Simulations provide students the opportunity to observe the outcomes of their actions, and take responsibility for decision-making via problem-solving competencies, thus leading to a more active, transformative and experiential reception of knowledge.
Another important finding is that simulations have positive effects on both students and instructors. Positive outcomes exist when instructors set achievable learning goals, interact with students promoting knowledge, support, facilitate, and motivate them to construct new game-based knowledge (Kovalik & Kuo,
2012
; Lameras et al.,
2016
). Instructors are encouraged to design games and simulations in order to make students fully aware of game activities, providing all the while continuous instructional guidance. These results generally confirm the findings from prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, findings diverge slightly in Young et al.’s survey (
2012
), who claim that there is limited or no evidence about the effective implementation of games in the lecture-based curriculum.
This review also covers behavioural outcomes, mainly the development of social, emotional, and collaborative skills, helping students to foster strong relationships with peers, empowering them to collaborate and work in groups more efficiently, become organised, adapt to new tasks, and resolve emerging conflicts. Furthermore, reality-based scenarios and action-oriented game activities promote fruitful interactions and meaningful feedback, which leads to collaborative construction of knowledge. Overall, digital games and simulations urge students to interact not only with the game, but with their instructors and co-players as well. These results have been extensively covered in the literature review, with the majority of researchers agreeing with the current study’s results, confirming the positive effects of games and simulations on the behavioural level of learning outcomes (Bellotti et al.,
2013
; Tsekleves et al.,
2014
; Fu et al.,
2016
; Carenys & Moya,
2016
).
However, although most reviews acknowledge the positive effects of games in behavioural outcomes, some reviewed studies contradict these positive findings, claiming that teamwork is a controversial issue when it comes to the improvement of knowledge sharing. The use of games seems to decrease opportunities for peer interaction and communication with instructors (Bolliger et al.,
2015
), whereas playing individually is sometimes considered better than working in a team (Merchant et al.,
2014
). Also, in some cases, games and simulations through collaborative activities distract students and hinder learning (Dankbaar et al.,
2016
).
The current review makes a significant contribution by investigating the affective outcomes when incorporating games and simulations in the curriculum, especially motivational and engagement outcomes, emotional development, satisfaction, attitude, emotion, self-assessment, and self-efficacy. Results show that games and simulations motivate, engage and promote effective learning goals by providing opportunities for learners to actively experience, practice, interact, and reflect in a collaborative, game-based, and learner-centred setting. The measures evaluating student attitudes reveal an increasingly positive trend towards games and simulations, especially in post-interventions (Bekebrede et al.,
2011
; Giovanello et al.,
2013
; Costa et al.,
2014
; Angelini,
2016
; Geithner & Menzel,
2016
).
To this end, there has been a purposeful highlighting of the instructor’s role as facilitator and motivator in this literature review. Through in-game activities and extended discussion, instructors promote student interaction and help them overcome the lack of understanding of content curriculum and achieve better learning outcomes. The literature also stresses the role of emotional development, which facilitates improvement of learning outcomes. Specifically, there seems to be a progression in student emotion, from negative feelings including uncertainty, anxiety, nervousness, and disappointment during pre-intervention, to positive feelings of satisfaction, confidence, excitement, enjoyment, effort, fascination, and enthusiasm during in-game and post-game interventions (Huang et al.,
2010
; Hummel et al.,
2011
; Liao & Wang,
2011
; Terzidou et al.,
2012
; Woo,
2014
; Liao et al.,
2015
).
Most of the pre-existing evidence is compatible with the findings of this systematic review (Sitzmann,
2011
; Connolly et al.,
2012
; Wouters et al.,
2013
; Ritzhaupt et al.,
2014
; Gegenfurtner et al.,
2014
; Shin et al.,
2015
; Lameras et al.,
2016
; Carenys & Moya,
2016
; Fu et al.,
2016
; Warren et al.,
2016
). Nevertheless, one study indicates that the overall positive perception of students depends on the different forms of games (Riemer & Schader,
2015
), namely, simulations promote a less positive effect compared to quizzes and adventures. Some other studies diverge further in their findings, indicating either neutral (Rajan et al.,
2013
; Strycker,
2016
; Franciosi,
2016
) or negative student attitudes towards the use of games (Chen et al.,
2010
; Jiménez-Munguía & Luna-Reyes,
2012
). Also, there are limited results on the effect of games on student self-efficacy, with one study demonstrating moderate post-training self-efficacy (Sitzmann,
2011
).
Comparing the findings of the current study with the findings of previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses leads to an interesting discussion. The results of the present review illustrate that the majority of the revised articles focus on different genres of games and simulations. The mostly represented genres are virtual/online games and simulations since they can enhance learning in certain disciplines, such as Computer Studies. This finding is in agreement with most of the previous reviews (e.g. Clark et al.,
2015
; Carenys & Moya,
2016
; Warren et al.,
2016
). Also, simulation games are found to be popular in this review, due to the fact that they are implemented in authentic learning environments, namely in Health Sciences and Biology. Also, in this study, a great representation of role - playing games and business simulation games are obviously resulted from the previous articles, due to the fact that they are implemented in specific academic disciplines, such as Business Management and Marketing. Nevertheless, in this review, serious games are not represented as much as in other reviews (e.g.Tsekleves et al.,
2014
; Fu et al.,
2016
).
Additionally, this study concentrates on the positive effects of games and simulations on learning outcomes, a finding that is compatible with previous reviews (e.g. Bellotti et al.,
2013
; Lameras et al.,
2016
; Clark et al.,
2015
. This review confirms that games and simulations contribute to cognitive learning outcomes, including knowledge acquisition, conceptual application, content understanding, and action-directed learning. Other previous reviewers echoed these findings (Smetana & Bell,
2012
; Shin et al.,
2015
; Wouters et al.,
2013
; Fu et al.,
2016
) emphasizing the important role of games in knowledge acquisition and content understanding. It has been illustrated that university students benefit from the incorporation of games into the learning process, if used as a supplement in traditional lectures, a finding that complies with other reviews (Sitzmann,
2011
; Wouters et al.,
2013
). However, simulations’ implementation is influenced by instructors’ guidance and motivation, as these factors encourage faculty to design simulations to achieve learning outcomes.
This review also sheds light on behavioural outcomes of using games in instructional design. The emphasis is on the positive effects, namely the development of social and soft skills, emotional skills, the empowerment of collaboration with peers, and the promotion of interaction and feedback, findings that are in line with past reviews (Shin et al.,
2015
; Carenys & Moya,
2016
). Despite the positive behavioural effects of utilizing games, some reviews find collaboration and teamwork as a hindrance for learning. The application of games seems to decrease peer interaction and communication with faculty, whereas in Merchant et al.’s review (
2014
), playing individually is more preferable than playing collaboratively. The current review concludes by highlighting the affective outcomes, and the emphasis is given on motivational and engaging factors that lead to emotional development, satisfaction, self-efficacy and self-assessment, findings that are also documented in other reviews (Sitzmann,
2011
; Hsu et al.,
2012
; Tsekleves et al.,
2014
).
To conclude, this review discusses the multitude of surveys on the cognitive, behavioural, and affective outcomes related to the use of playing games and simulations in higher education. The multi-dimensional analysis of the empirical data provides a framework for understanding the major outcomes of GBL. Despite the significant benefits in learning outcomes highlighted in this paper, the high cost of designing games and simulations is still a significant challenge. To overcome this cost barrier, governments, researchers, instructors, and game designers should collaborate to find affordable solutions, for enabling the development of games and simulations. Since this review does not concern itself with advanced aspects of learning, the focus should next turn to a metacognitive-oriented survey, which will study the promotion of metacognitive skills in students, such as self-regulation, self-reflection, self-awareness, evaluation, planning, building on the ideas of others, debating, and so forth.
Future research
Considering the above discussion points, and the importance of games and simulations as derived from the relevant literature, some suggested avenues for future research are as follows:
Researchers should focus on applying the relevant theoretical frameworks, such as cognitivism, constructivism, and socio-cultural perspectives to cognitive, behavioural and affective outcomes, respectively.
More research should be conducted investigating gender issues with respect to the effectiveness of games on developmental aspects of behaviour, such as scaffolding and immersion, to counteract the present gap in the existing literature.
Comparative surveys should be included with a design focused on different target groups (adult students, or K-12 students in laboratory conditions).
Evaluation models via a mixed-method design are encouraged, especially to investigate how game designers could tailor game designs to applying different learning preferences and styles.
University instructors should take a more active role in the alignment of games with the curriculum ensuring that games and simulations are implemented in a blended learning module (face-to-face, online material, etc.), or even acting as games masters, scaffolding virtual experiences to university learners.
Faculty should design games with a view to multiplayer cooperation to achieve effectiveness in learning outcomes. Students should also be involved as co-designers, recommending innovative ideas and radical approaches in an effort to meet their own needs. An innovative approach is the adoption of metagames (Young et al.,
2012
), which consist of additional learning resources (blogs, wikis, etc.) encouraging collaboration between players.
This study makes a significant contribution to research, since no other literature review or meta-analysis has been conducted so far investigating educational and web-based games and simulations with such an extensive subject and discipline coverage in higher education. Today’s demand for student-centred teaching methods to develop highly qualified learners, capable of learning in an active and collaborative environment, calls for the deployment of game-based activities and simulations that will enable them to face the challenges of the dawning era.
