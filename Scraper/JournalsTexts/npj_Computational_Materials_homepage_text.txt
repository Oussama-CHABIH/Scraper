MODEL, GUESS, CHECK: Wordle as a primer on active learning for materials research
Research and games both require the participant to make a series of choices. Active learning is a process borrowed from machine learning for algorithmically making choices that has become increasingly used to accelerate materials research. While this process may seem opaque to researchers outside the field of machine learning, examining active learning in games provides an accessible way to showcase the process and its virtues. Here, we examine active learning through the lens of the game Wordle to both explain the active learning process and describe the types of research questions that arise when using active learning for materials research.

Correcting the corrections for charged defects in crystals
While the theory of imperfections in solids is firmly established, procedures for first-principles calculations of defect quantities continue to evolve. A plethora of ad hoc correction schemes is being replaced by sophisticated self-consistent procedures that will enable more quantitative predictions of the formation energies of defect species and their spectroscopic signatures.

While the theory of imperfections in solids is firmly established, procedures for first-principles calculations of defect quantities continue to evolve. A plethora of ad hoc correction schemes is being replaced by sophisticated self-consistent procedures that will enable more quantitative predictions of the formation energies of defect species and their spectroscopic signatures.

MODEL, GUESS, CHECK: Wordle as a primer on active learning for materials research
Research and games both require the participant to make a series of choices. Active learning is a process borrowed from machine learning for algorithmically making choices that has become increasingly used to accelerate materials research. While this process may seem opaque to researchers outside the field of machine learning, examining active learning in games provides an accessible way to showcase the process and its virtues. Here, we examine active learning through the lens of the game Wordle to both explain the active learning process and describe the types of research questions that arise when using active learning for materials research.

-Block elements for catalysis
Renewable energy applications largely rely on transition metal catalysts. Similar to organocatalysts,
p
-block elements exhibit transition-metal-like catalytic performances. Si Zhou and co-workers review the latest advances in
p
-block elements as catalysts for energy conversion to deeply understand the concept of metal-free catalysis and establish the design principles for
p

Here, we examine active learning through the lens of the game Wordle to both explain the active learning process and describe the types of research questions that arise when using active learning for materials research.

Correcting the corrections for charged defects in crystals
While the theory of imperfections in solids is firmly established, procedures for first-principles calculations of defect quantities continue to evolve. A plethora of ad hoc correction schemes is being replaced by sophisticated self-consistent procedures that will enable more quantitative predictions of the formation energies of defect species and their spectroscopic signatures.

Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting the paradigm of two-phase heat transfer research. Recent innovations in AI and machine learning uniquely offer the potential for collecting new types of physically meaningful features that have not been addressed in the past, for making their insights available to other domains, and for solving for physical quantities based on first principles for phase-change thermofluidic systems. This review outlines core ideas of current AI technologies connected to thermal energy science to illustrate how they can be used to push the limit of our knowledge boundaries about boiling and condensation phenomena. AI technologies for meta-analysis, data extraction, and data stream analysis are described with their potential challenges, opportunities, and alternative approaches. Finally, we offer outlooks and perspectives regarding physics-centered machine learning, sustainable cyberinfrastructures, and multidisciplinary efforts that will help foster the growing trend of AI for phase-change heat and mass transfer.

Introduction
Understanding phase-change heat transfer is important to numerous applications related to the advancement of energy conversion and thermal management systems. In particular, liquid-vapor phase-change processes continuously garner the interest of thermal scientists due to their ability to transfer large amounts of energy effectively
1
. Central to these processes is the nucleation of the dispersed phase (i.e., bubbles and droplets for boiling or condensation processes), where the continuous phases are liquid and vapor, respectively. The bubble or droplet dynamics can be manipulated by modulating experimental designs, including surface properties, structures, and materials, to push the limit of heat transfer performances
2
. Historically, bubble and droplet dynamics have been studied through the combination of nucleation theory
3
,
4
,
5
, thermodynamics
6
,
7
,
8
,
9
, and phenomenological correlations
10
. Yet despite phase-change heat transfer’s century-long history, fully understanding its mechanistic relationships by linking experimental factors, complex nucleation statistics, and thermal performance remains an elusive challenge. A primary reason for this obscurity can be attributed to
data inconsistency
caused by a wide variety of operating conditions and experimental protocols along with measurement uncertainties
11
. Another reason is the
difficulty in quantifying boiling and condensation behaviors
because of their highly dynamic, complex, and high-dimensional nature
12
,
13
. Further difficulties arise in the
management and curation of data streams
, which have high implications for predicting and forecasting multi-phase flow patterns. The key concepts in phase-change heat transfer are listed in Box
1
.
In the era of big data, transforming large quantities of data into useful knowledge plays an increasingly important role across various engineering disciplines. Artificial intelligence (AI), a term coined by John McCarthy in 1955, was defined by him as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” It has emerged as a dominant force for performing data-to-knowledge conversion and presents an attractive complement to traditional computational science. AI technologies simulate human intelligence processes through machines, particularly computer systems. Current AI technologies primarily fall in the category of “narrow” AI, which refers to an AI that can outperform humans on a particular task
14
. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI where machines can learn without explicitly being programmed
15
. Neural networks trained using statistical methods make inferences from data that can lead to decision-making. Deep learning (DL), a class of ML inspired by our brain’s neural network, can learn multi-level representations of data hierarchically
16
. While most existing AI solutions are still considered black boxes, the scope of ML and DL transcends mere nonlinear regression. Notably, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now able to discover new material
17
,
18
, help model path- and history-dependent problems
19
, inversely design material structures
20
, and discover hidden physics from data
21
, as Box
2
describes the key concepts in AI and ML. Box
3
describes key concepts of digital inference that have seen great progress with advancements in AI and ML.
Box 1 Key concepts in phase-change heat transfer
The boiling and condensation heat transfer performances are typically evaluated by measuring the heat flux in relation to temperature differences between the target surface (i.e., wall) and bulk liquid (i.e., superheat). We summarize important concepts for phase-change heat transfer below:
Heat transfer curve
. The heat transfer curve showcases the temperature difference between the surface
T
s
and the bulk fluid (usually at saturation temperature
T
sat
) and the corresponding heat flux (i.e., the rate of heat transferred per unit projected surface area), where the temperature differences are called the superheat and subcooling for boiling or condensation, respectively. Both boiling and condensation exhibit convection, nucleation-dominated, transition, and film-dominated regimes. The nucleation-dominated regime is commonly referred to as nucleate boiling and dropwise condensation regimes in literature and naturally lies at the heart of nucleation statistics-based research.
Onset of nucleation
. The onset of nucleation (ON), also known as the nucleation incipience, is the point at which the dispersed phase first appears at the heat transfer surface.
Heat transfer coefficient
. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the temperature difference or the slope of the heat transfer curve. A higher HTC indicates that a greater amount of thermal energy can be transferred (i.e., absorbed or released) at a given temperature difference. In other words, the HTC quantifies the heat transfer efficiency of the phase-change process, and therefore a primary research thrust for thermal engineers is to increase the slope of the heat transfer curve. Because the HTC is intrinsically tethered to trade-offs between the desire for bubble or droplet nucleation and the necessity of removing them from the target surface, understanding the nucleation dynamics becomes an imperative factor to modulate the heat transfer curve
29
.
Critical heat flux
. When plotting the heat transfer curve, the heat flux increases with increasing superheat or subcooling until a critical point. The corresponding heat flux to the critical point is defined as the critical heat flux (CHF), beyond which the HTC decreases sharply, and filmwise boiling or condensation modes develop
29
. Since film-dominated regimes show larger thermal resistance and less effective heat transfer performance, research has focused on strategies to remove bubbles or droplets from the surface before film-dominated regimes begin to dominate

Box 2 Key concepts in AI and machine learning
Understanding AI for phase-change heat transfer requires familiarity with current technologies and their concepts. Below is a short overview of core terminologies in the broadest possible sense, without emphasis on mathematical detail.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are a hierarchical organization of neurons in layers containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of layers is the
depth
of the network. In practice, shallow ANNs may not be sufficiently expressive and have limited learnability
108
. Deep neural networks (DNNs), on the other hand, can learn more complex patterns at various levels of abstraction and are better at generalization
109
. ANNs are represented by a spectrum of different architectures.
Multilayer perceptron
. A perceptron is the simplest form of an ANN binary classifier developed in the 1950s
110
. While a single-layer perceptron consists of only the input units and an output layer, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) contains one or more layers (i.e., hidden layers) between the input and output to learn more complex, nonlinear functions
110
.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are a type of ANNs showing remarkable success in the detection, segmentation, and recognition of objects and regions in images
34
. CNNs typically comprise of convolutional layers for extracting feature maps, pooling layers to aggregate features, and fully connected layers for high-level reasoning prior to making predictions at the output layer
109
,
111
.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
are a class of ANNs that uses sequential or time series data. It includes a recurrent hidden state whose activation at each time depends on that of the previous time
109
. Hence, RNNs are capable of capturing and storing long-dependence relationships, which has led to their common use for temporal problems
109
.
Supervised learning
is a machine learning methodology where a model is trained using labeled data (meaning data that is annotated with correct answers or labels)
109
. The training dataset plays a vital role for supervised learning algorithms to effectively learn. It is also worth noting that while supervised learning is currently the dominant learning paradigm in machine learning, it is not representative of human and animal learning
112
.
Unsupervised learning
, in contrast to supervised learning, focuses on discovering underlying patterns in unlabeled datasets
34
. Although unsupervised learning models learn from raw data without any predefined labels or target outputs, there is often a need for larger training data to yield desired results as complex phenomena can often be challenging to decode without domain expertise or prior knowledge.
Transfer learning
is the adapting of a pre-trained model for a wide range of downstream tasks, using minimal additional data for each new task
113
. For example, leveraging feature representations from models already trained on large datasets such as ImageNet
114
and Common Objects in Context (COCO) datasets
115
, have become a central part of models
116
.
Box 3 Key concepts of digital inference
Digital inference has assisted thermal engineers over the last several decades. With the advancement of DL models for CV, researchers can now extract nucleation features with unprecedented resolutions.
Computer vision
. Computer vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to infer meaningful information from images and videos.
Image classification
. The origin of digital image inference can be traced back to automated image classification approaches, where predictions describing the image or a list of classes of objects in an image are provided based on their classification scores
117
.
Object detection and localization
. While image classification by itself has merits and practicality, the features that it uses have limited capability to provide physically meaningful descriptors for nucleation processes. The next incremental step from coarse to fine image inference is object detection and localization, the task of determining where objects (i.e., bubbles and droplets) are located in a given image (object localization) and which category each object belongs to (object classification)
118
. At this stage, valuable information such as the rough size, distribution, and spatial coordinates of the nuclei can be collected in the form of bounding boxes or centroids.
Semantic segmentation
. Semantic segmentation allows for more detailed spatial analysis (e.g., void fraction) by labeling every pixel according to its class
119
.
Instance segmentation
. Progressing for finer inference leads to instance segmentation, which provides separate labels for each object belonging to the same object class.
Object tracking
. Object tracking for collecting high-fidelity spatio-temporal nucleation statistics is a hierarchical process that has important implications for better understanding mechanistic two-phase nucleation principles. At the lower end of the hierarchy, spatial features such as the two-phase demography (i.e., size, location, distribution) or void fraction provide foundational information describing how bubbles or droplets nucleate, coalesce, and depart. At the higher end of the hierarchy, the extracted features are linked to time, rendering features (i.e., growth rate, nucleation interaction type, departure frequency, departure size, rising velocity) that can express the surface activity with much more context.
Overview
Within the phase-change heat transfer community, the plethora of recent AI-based approaches has motivated heat transfer researchers to explore their capabilities to advance fundamental nucleation sciences under a new paradigm (Fig.
1
). Despite its potential, adaptations or discussions of AI technique have traditionally been slow in this field, which makes this untapped disruptive technology even more attractive. Figure
2
summarizes the number of publications on AI and two-phase heat transfer research areas. According to the results, the publications for pure AI or two-phase heat transfer (approximately 100 K) outweigh those from AI-integrated two-phase heat transfer research (i.e., AI + phase-change) categories by several orders of magnitude (approximately 100). While this ratio suggests that AI-integrated two-phase heat transfer research is relatively new, it also implies that this subfield is growing at a rate that exceeds that of both individual fields. Indeed, with the ongoing AI “gold rush” taking place in this field, the time is ripe to carefully review recent publications. To this end, the current article addresses the pressing need for a thorough review, explaining the core ideas of AI technologies, the innate challenges involved with phase-change processes and limited use of AI in the past (Fig.
1a
), current implementation status and challenges (Fig.
1b
), and future outlooks for two-phase heat transfer research (Fig.
1c
). The article builds on prior reviews that introduced the intersection of AI and heat transfer in either a broad sense
22
, or for different applications facing disparate challenges than those of boiling and condensation heat transfer
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
. The critical review and summary will provide valuable insights into the implementation of AI for liquid-vapor phase-change heat transfer studies, with the goal to provide the thermal science community with a roadmap for future research.

The data for phase-change categories are found using keywords such as boiling or condensation. The data for phase-change studies involving AI (i.e., AI + phase-change) are obtained from the combination of the above two searches. In 2021, the number of publications on AI-based two-phase research increases by 365% compared to 2018 but still only occupies 0.8% of boiling and condensation research. The survey underlines the need for further studies that integrate AI into two-phase heat transfer research.

State-of-the-art AI technologies for phase-change heat transfer
The article first discusses current AI technologies available in the heat transfer community (Fig.
1b
) categorized based on how they target major and relevant two-phase heat transfer problems existing today. AI technologies are broadly divided into three categories, namely
meta-analysis
,
physical feature extraction
, and
data stream analysis
.
Meta-analysis
Meta-analysis on multiple datasets is generally conducted to provide a holistic description of phase-change heat transfer by either corroborating consistent datasets or revisiting conflicting datasets, usually in the form of tabular data
28
. This is important because both experimental and computational data collection in this field is expensive and requires significant upfront investment. Additionally, various combinations of experimental factors—including the material, thickness, surface roughness or structures, and surface/working fluid wettability—exert significant influence on the datasets
29
. Moreover, the cumulative data available today have high variance and is hypersensitive towards various operating conditions
30
, mounting protocols
31
, characterization procedures
32
, and the personnel’s experience level. Once meta-datasets are collected, data dimensionality is orders of magnitude larger, making it challenging to understand. To address these challenges, a recent movement in the thermal science field seeks to exploit available scientific advances through
machine learning-assisted meta-analysis
(Fig.
3
).

data-driven hypothesis, followed by

two-phase experiments.

artificial neural networks for meta-regression analysis.

Data-driven hypothesis approach
ML models can be efficient by assisting professionals to make holistic data-driven hypothesis development by learning big data. ML-assisted meta-analysis can play a role in learning knowledge from data and extracting data from knowledge, as described in Fig.
3
. The first step introduces building hypotheses based on accumulated datasets to answer scientific questions in phase-change heat transfer (Fig.
3a
). After two-phase experiments are designed and performed (Fig.
3b
), the experimental factors (tabular data) (Fig.
3c
) are then used to train neural networks to find the relations between the experimental factors and their output (heat transfer performance) (Fig.
3d
), thus helping researchers inform their understanding and decisions with data.
Unlike traditional theory-driven approaches, which rely on the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of the observed phenomena, data-driven approaches can uncover statistical relationships and patterns solely from data even without explicit knowledge of the underlying physics or mathematical functions. This characteristic enables ML models achieving high-accuracy predictions to be trained in a matter of hours compared to the extensive period and resources required to develop new heat transfer theories. However, data-driven approaches typically require larger diverse datasets for generalization, the size of which depends on the specific problem, and lack the interpretability offered by theory-driven approaches.
Regression models
Most ML-based meta-analysis models utilize regression analysis to link experimental factors with non-dimensional numbers or global heat transfer quantities such as CHF, HTC, or pressure drop over the entire system (Supplementary Table
1
). The generic feed-forward ANN architecture, also known as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
33
, and random forest (RF) methods have been the most popular
33
, probably because they are some of the most well-understood techniques in literature today. Both ANNs (or MLPs) and RF are exceptional at modeling complex nonlinear relationships, with the general idea of approaching problems by deconstructing them into smaller simpler units. ANNs are organized into layers of interconnected nodes, in which “weights” are assigned to represent the value of information assigned to an individual node
34
. Similarly, RFs statistically identify important features, create multiple randomly chosen weak decision trees, and collect their votes to make the final electoral decision. To handle complexity and overfitting issues, ANNs can adjust hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers and units, regularization techniques, and learning rates, whereas RFs can modulate the number of trees, the maximal size or depth of the single tree, and sampling rate
35
. ANNs typically have more flexibility in their architecture designs, while RFs, although less explainable than conventional decision trees
36
, are reported to possess potentially better interpretability than the so-called black-box predictions of typical ANNs
35
. In general, no single ML model works the best across all problems, and therefore it is good practice to compare the performance of different techniques or create a hybrid model that combines multiple feature types
37
. Other ML algorithms that have previously been investigated include the support vector machines (SVMs)
33
, boosting algorithms
33
,
38
, cascade feedforward (CF) networks
38
, radial basis function (RDF)
38
, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
39
, deep belief networks (DBNs)
40
, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
41
, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
42
,
43
.
Challenges and opportunities
The training data for meta-analysis models are often inadequate or sporadic, which can pose a great challenge for developing robust ML models. The training data from experiments that exist today are sparse due to the prohibitive cost of acquiring more experimental data points, especially considering the difficulties associated with replicating most nm – μm scale bottom-up fabricated surfaces
2
. On the other hand, training data from simulation models are relatively denser, but are limited to extremely simple cases. Recent studies have suggested that
adding physics into the learning process
and
developing surrogate ML models
can address these issues by efficiently training ML models with limited training resources
44
,
45
.
First, breakthroughs in physics-informed machine learning (e.g., PINNs) have demonstrated that data from both measurements and simulations, and the underlying laws of physics can be integrated into the loss function of the neural network, thereby providing strong theoretical constraints to prevent models from generating unreasonable predictions. This not only allows models to train with less data than is typical for over-parameterized DL models by narrowing the search space, but also enables them to estimate values that extend beyond the trained data scope. Although a major challenge remains in the search and development of physical models that best represent the increased volume, velocity, and variety of available data, other communities suggest that PINNs can succeed
21
,
46
, even for such ill-conditioned problems, in cases where other models cannot. This suggests new research opportunities for meta-analysis implementations in the phase-change heat transfer community.
Second, developing surrogate ML models that sensibly augment the training data to generate diverse problem instances can improve the model’s generalizability even with minimal training data. A surrogate model is a trained emulator that learns to approximate solutions through known input-output behaviors when an outcome of interest cannot be easily measured or computed. Therefore, filling in the gaps of these scattered data points will allow the models to learn higher-dimensional insights that can be extended to unexplored study regimes.
Physical feature extraction
Beyond the meta-data analysis, it is imperative to extract physically meaningful features from visual data. Digital inference and extraction of datasets have the potential to enhance our understanding of new physics within large datasets by enabling a full description about two-phase physics. One area of particular interest is the quantification of nucleation behaviors during two-phase processes, which has been a focus since the pioneering work of Nukiyama and Schmidt
47
,
48
. While visualizing nucleation behaviors has naturally become an inseparable part of phase-change studies
49
,
50
,
51
,
52
,
53
,
54
, the sheer complexity and volume of bubble and droplet activities (Fig.
4a and c
) make quantifying these activities a daunting challenge. In this regard, AI-assisted CV can be effective at performing image analysis tasks with high-level accuracy but with far greater bandwidth
12
,
13
,
55
. Most noticeable advances come from characterizing two-phase nucleation features with the basis of modern CV tasks from CNN models built for digital image inference tasks (Box
3
).

and

The only studies that have been able to investigate nucleation dynamics across a relatively wide heat flux range are ones that utilize bottom-to-top infrared (IR) imaging techniques, in which the translation from bottom IR bubble statistics to actual bubble morphologies are not well understood. Literature review of
d
| condensation shows that 86% studies either excluded heat transfer characterizations (50%) or measured heat and mass transfer in a decoupled manner, independent of droplet statistics. Only 11% of the reviewed studies demonstrated fully coupled heat and mass transfer analysis based on droplet statistics, where 4 of the 6 coupled analysis studies were done manually. The references that have helped form the conclusions in this figure for pool boiling and condensation are provided in Supplementary Table
4
and Supplementary Table
5
, respectively.

Overview of nucleation statistics and heat and mass transfer
Concurrent with the advances in AI and CV has been an increasing demand to support a stronger connection between bubble and droplet statistics and thermal performances. For example, a significant portion of extant bubble dynamics studies only reports low- to moderate-heat flux regimes, leaving an extensive range of high-heat flux regimes unexplored during pool boiling (Fig.
4b
; Supplementary Table
4
). Similarly, droplet nucleation statistics are also highly indicative of hidden condensation heat and mass transport mechanics. However, only a handful of studies have attempted to extract spatio-temporal instances (STI) that are essential for decrypting heat transfer analysis. According to a brief literature review of 56 recent studies reporting droplet dynamics from 2015 (Fig.
4d
; Supplementary Table
5
), the vast majority report only spatial features or spatio-temporal group-based (STG) analysis, where relatively simple traditional CV algorithms or manual labor are still favored (Fig.
4d
). In addition, only 11% of the reviewed studies demonstrate heat and mass transfer analysis coupled with droplet statistics, further underlining the need for a stronger connection between the two approaches (Fig.
4d
inset).
Traditional computer vision
For a very long time, rudimentary image processing algorithms have extracted basic nucleation features to describe phase-change phenomena
56
,
57
,
58
,
59
. These traditional CV approaches use relatively simple processing algorithms such as binarization, denoising, flooding, and interactive separation of connected objects to capture the most basic physical descriptors such as bubble or droplet size and distribution
57
,
60
. While these approaches are quite useful and swift, they still ultimately rely on handcrafted features that inevitably require significant setting optimizations often under-reported in the literature
61
,
62
. To address this issue, there have been efforts to develop shape filters or reconstruction algorithms such as built-in circle finder scripts or multi-step shape reconstruction procedures that specifically exploit the circular shape of bubbles and droplets
60
,
63
,
64
,
65
,
66
,
67
. Yet, due to these methods’ inherent imposition of rules, it has been difficult for traditional CV models to adapt to image inventories from the broader research community, with numerous studies reporting unstable predictions, even with a slight change of lighting
66
,
67
.
Machine learning-assisted computer vision
Recent integrations of DL models into CV have brought a paradigm shift in how researchers perceive and utilize visual data to tackle difficult problems. DL models “learn” salient features of the target object, thereby requiring less expert analysis and parametric fine-turning, and possess superior flexibility in adapting to custom datasets compared to traditional CV approaches
68
. For the time being, studies implementing models with CNN backbones have seen the most success due to their proficiency at handling image data
12
,
13
,
55
,
69
.
For boiling, the ability to extract spatio-temporal bubble statistics has proven direct implications for heat flux partitioning analysis (See Supplementary Note
1
), the process of understanding what heat transfer mechanisms constitute the boiling heat flux at any given stage
70
,
71
,
72
, as well as flow instability analysis
73
. However, extracting a sufficient amount of classical boiling features (i.e., departure diameter, nucleation site density, departure frequency) from imaging data has been an inherently burdensome and evasive task. The autonomous curation of high-quality bubble statistics at the large scale has been shown to be achievable through DL-assisted segmentation and tracking
73
,
74
, enabling the quantitative mapping of bubble dynamics between different boiling surfaces at high resolutions
12
.
Condensation studies have shown that heat transfer can be effectively quantified by collecting statistics of group of droplets or individual droplets (See Supplementary Note
2
) and integrating them over the entire surface
13
,
69
. A study on group-based droplet statistics has shown that the overall time-averaged droplet shedding frequency can be used to calculate the heat transfer rate by using Supplementary Equation
5
and
6
, which ultimately reduced the high (20 – 100%) measurement uncertainty of conventional temperature and flow sensors less than 10%
69
. In another study, collecting single-droplet-level statistics imposed with energy balance equation has allowed for the mapping of the evolving heat transfer of condensing surfaces with extreme spatio- and temporal- resolutions of 300 nm and 200 ms, respectively
13
.
The recent demonstrations of statistics-driven heat transfer quantifications are particularly exciting because they enable the robust comparison and de-coupling of the multi-dimensional relationship among nucleation parameters, heat transfer performances, and structural design. In addition, these techniques can be used to simultaneously compare the heat transfer performances on a single surface with different structures or wettabilities
69
, which not only minimizes time and labor resources but also essentially eliminates uncertainties caused during separate experiment trials.
A summary of studies that quantify boiling and condensation nucleation behaviors from 2015–2022 are provided in Fig.
5
and Supplementary Table
4
–
6
. We define real-time prediction for models that have the capability of making predictions in live streams, quasi-real-time prediction for models that require an interventional processing step, and extensive prediction for models that report an undefined amount of time. The extracted physics are categorized as spatial, STG, STI, and hidden, which refers to the non-intuitive features of the hidden layers in ANNs.

The regime map reveals a tradeoff between the processing time and the extent of physically meaningful features extracted.

Challenges and opportunities
DL-based nucleation feature extraction models are still far from being widely adopted in the heat transfer community, as evident in Fig.
5
. The fact that despite modern advances in CV, manual analysis is still a highly favored method for quantifying nucleation dynamics suggests that there exists a gap between thermal and computer scientists. Therefore, further efforts should be considered to make these ML-based quantification methods more efficient and user-friendly by
fine-tuning the models to be suitable for specific two-phase conditions
and
improving training methodologies
.
One challenge is about how two-dimensional image sequences can accurately represent three-dimensional phenomena. This representation often results in different subproblems specific to two-phase phenomena such as occlusion (situations when an object fully or partially hides another object of the same class from the optical viewpoint), cluster, and low resolution. One method that researchers have investigated involves the refining of initially predicted results through multi-step shape reconstruction processes
75
,
76
,
77
,
78
. While initial object detection methods may vary (i.e., bounding box, regional proposal, image segmentation), the concept of reconstructing the digital inference from initially rough object outlines to its true shape remains the same
75
,
76
,
77
,
78
. However, these models are not programmed or trained to inherently recognize the occlusion phenomena themselves and are therefore limited to weakly occluded instances. Researchers soon realized that the model’s predictive capability can be finetuned to specific problems by modulating the training dataset. By customarily labeling droplets that were blurred by motion, researchers successfully trained the model to predict images captured at low framerates
69
. In another study, a model was trained to accurately predict occluded droplets by custom-labeling droplets that formed underneath larger droplets
79
. Other efforts include the use of synthetic datasets created from generative adversarial networks (GAN)
75
, or simulations
80
. The rationale of using such synthetic datasets to train is to carefully design a dataset with a controlled amount of object occlusion, nucleation sites, object density, and size to emphasize model learning for difficult scenarios. Hence, there must be a continuous effort to explore various training sets to investigate what and how the model learns, depending on the research objective.
Another challenge is centered upon data preparation. Due to the intrinsically complex phenomena being studied, data labeling requires experts. Most upcoming models use supervised learning, which requires training datasets in the form of labeled images. The image labeling process, called image annotation, can take up to several months to manually prepare a complete dataset for training and validation
13
. More often, the ground truth for the labeling is subjective and involves human intervention, making unanimous agreement among annotators impossible
81
. To combat such discrepancies, researchers have proposed using cost-effective, human-in-the-loop curations or semi-supervised learning that can alleviate annotation labor and increase labeling consistency
82
,
83
. For example, a recent study proposed a multi-step cycle of initial pretrained model predictions, human-aided error identification and correction, and retraining on an updated dataset
83
. While training an initial model to start the loop remains an ongoing challenge, abundant research opportunities exist developing in fully autonomous labeling pipelines using deep generative models to conditionally generate sequential visual scenes that mimic real states
84
,
85
,
86
, or even label-free unsupervised learning-based nucleation feature extractors to reduce time and labor involved in training and validating models.
Above all, the effort-to-reward ratio for exploring key features that describe underlying boiling and condensation mechanisms significantly favors researchers today. For example, features that connect nuclei interactions and heat transfer have been rarely discussed in the literature but can now be studied in depth with light algorithmic adjustments. Furthermore, big data trends of long-term nuclei statistics can provide rational mechanistic insights but are yet to be reported. By adding a tracking module to an object detection framework, researchers have proved that features with substantially higher-order insights could be extracted from videos with minimum modifications.
Data stream analysis
Another theme in AI research related to phase-change is to comprehend the
transient
nature of meta-data or visual data during phase-change processes. Given the strong yet complex correlation between “in-motion” data and heat transfer performance, researchers have classified the multi-phase flow patterns into various categories
2
,
29
. For example, the cyclic nucleation behaviors that constitute the heat transfer curves (Box
1
) have traditionally been categorized into natural convection, nucleation-dominated, transition, and film-dominated regimes
29
. Evolving flow patterns in flow boiling systems have been classified into liquid, bubbly, slug, annular, mist, and vapor regimes
87
. Real-time data stream analysis using AI has the potential to identify or predict nucleation phases and patterns, which can be applied in smart boiling and condensation systems (Fig.
6a
) for adaptive or predictive decision-making.
Fig. 6: Data stream analysis.
Understanding streaming data can be utilized to build
a
smart two-phase systems that make real-time adaptations by receiving feedback from systems using either discrete or continuous models.
b
On the one hand, unstable and transient multi-phase flow patterns are classified into discrete outputs when using discrete models. These classifications can offer instant feedback to change device settings when differences in flow patterns are detected.
c
Continuous models have implications for real-time predictions as well as time-series forecasting. The models can use time-series texts or visual images to forecast a CHF event and stops the system in real-time before the event occurs.
Full size image
Discrete models
It is important to identify transient and unstable two-phase patterns into discrete class outputs, which is equivalent to the traditional ML classification problem
88
. The successful identification of patterns will help devices or systems operate under optimal conditions depending on their specific requirements, as illustrated in Fig.
6
. For example, nucleate boiling in passive two-phase heat transfer devices, such as heat pipes, is typically detrimental to the device’s performance due to significant heat and mass transfer reduction caused by entrapped vapor bubbles inside the wick
89
. By contrast, the creation of small and replenishable droplets and bubbles is favorable to facilitating heat transfer in high-power heat exchangers
1
. In these nucleation-favoring applications, identifying the transition from the nucleation-dominated regime to the film-dominated regime is crucial to maintain high heat transfer performances as well as safe operating conditions
1
,
2
Despite its significance, there have been only a few ML studies that demonstrate these classification tasks (Fig.
6b
). The classification can be executed by using different types of data, ranging from signal patterns collected from sensors to qualitative visual descriptions of gas and liquid phase morphologies
90
. Since visual descriptors are outwardly more intuitive, the majority of studies have utilized visualization-based ML classification models (Supplementary Table
6
). Naturally, CNN models have been heavily adopted to stream classification problems, with many models exceeding 98% prediction accuracy
55
,
91
. One study showed that CNN models could even deal with difficult visual cases, such as the transition from nucleate to film boiling, which trained experts cannot distinguish with any reasonable certainty
55
. It is worth noting that approaches that use structured data (i.e., non-imaging data) are also important, for they allow data stream classification where visualization might be limited or even inaccessible (e.g., in-tube flows) but is rarely addressed
92
,
93
.
Continuous models
In addition to discrete outputs, ML can also be employed to predict and forecast continuous outputs (Fig.
6c
) using regression analysis. Regression methods are proficient at determining casual relations between independent and dependent variables and therefore have major applications for numerical and visual time-series forecasting (Fig.
6c
; Supplementary Note
3
)
94
. Both time-series forecasting methods utilize transient data streams to predict future outcome trends (Fig.
6c
), but visual forecasting approaches reconstruct the data into visual scenes and are viewed to be more computationally expensive.
Continuous models are especially appealing for prediction and forecasting tasks because they can potentially be trained to encode the context of the two-phase phenomena, offering a great advantage over traditional sensors and probes. The models often hypothesize that a DL model can be trained to predict heat and mass transfer using secondary, higher-resolution characterization methods, such as visualization as an input. This would effectively allow the model to make more “physically-intuitive” or “scene-incorporating” predictions. Recent studies have confirmed this hypothesis, showing that vision-based models are highly sensitive to physically interpretable features such as the number and size of bubbles
91
, and there are strong correlations between collected bubble parameters and boiling heat flux intensity
55
.
Challenges and opportunities
Although the main keywords of data stream analysis are “real-time” and “forecasting,” neither one of these goals has been adequately met in the existing literature. A noticeable flaw is the use of previously collected data streams instead of live-streaming data. Therefore, future goals must shift the current paradigm of data stream analysis to
streaming data analysis
, where models train on more realistic data. The main keys to achieving this goal are to improve model transferability, explore indicative features, and expedite prediction time.
The first key is to improve model transferability factoring in the diverse boundary conditions that contribute to the complex and heterogeneous two-phase behaviors. While data supports that models can predict accurately settings familiar to the environments in which they were trained, studies customarily mention the need for additional training datasets for new boundary conditions
55
,
91
. Data augmentation or transfer learning techniques can be leveraged to remediate this issue, but only to some extent because they instigate the constant involvement of computer engineers to update the model
55
,
91
. Considering the inevitability and necessity of building
foundational models
, it remains an open question as to whether sufficient data can be collected and used to train models that incorporate the full complexity of the heterogeneous boiling and condensation phenomenon in varying conditions.
Another method to improve ML models is to identify
indicative features
that best represent the two-phase time-series problems. The features can be identified by engineering new features or selecting a new set of features
95
. As such, this process requires significant domain expertise in two-phase heat transfer to understand new features that can capture complex and nonlinear heat transfer performances during phase-change. Due to these aspects, unraveling the enigmatic features that can realize real-time prediction and forecasting is an ongoing challenge. For instance, a recent study utilized dimensionally-reduced image data to forecast future bubble morphologies based on a bidirectional LSTM network
96
. Images provide a visual representation of nucleation dynamics, which ultimately reflect the influence of experimental factors on the system. Consequently, investigating generalizable features that establish connections between nucleation patterns and desired outputs, researchers can potentially achieve a deeper understanding of nucleation phenomena and develop models that can be applied across various experimental conditions, leading to broader and more robust scientific insights. Future work should improve forecasting ML models by exploring a wide range of data types, including structured data (i.e., numerical data, or categorical data; low-dimensional), unstructured data (text, images, audio, video, or multi-modal; high-dimensional), and their hybrids (i.e., multimodal deep learning).
Additionally, it is crucial to evaluate the features based on their processing time, ensuring that they enable real-time prediction and forecasting. Models that utilize structured data inputs have quicker prediction speeds but at the expense of lower levels of physics. In contrast, models using unstructured data can extract physically meaningful features but are time-consuming, as showcased in Fig.
6
. Typically, graphic datasets are highly information-dense and therefore can easily be inundated with redundant or irrelevant pixels (i.e., background data or noise), which requires additional data processing steps to reduce the data dimensionality or filtering important information only
97
. While dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., principal component analysis, resolution scaling) partially address the latency issues of vision-based models, they do so by sacrificing high-frequency image features and by introducing additional preprocessing steps, which have been underreported in many cases. An alternative solution is to selectively exploit only the important information. One recent study showed that this could be done by using neuromorphic event cameras that emulate the human retina, thereby only outputting “meaningful events” (i.e., pixels that display changes in brightness)
97
,
98
. The fundamentally different way that event cameras encode visual scenes allows them to be proficient for applications with strong constraints on latency, power consumption, or bandwidth
99
. In addition, the ability to remove unwanted, stationary background noise potentially allows neuromorphic cameras to resist from generalizability issues stemming from measurements across multiple labs and institutes which may use different experimental setups. While the practical employment of event cameras is vastly underexplored, models that classified boiling regimes by using simulated event streams demonstrated a 300% increase in prediction speed compared to ML models reported elsewhere. Along the same lines, other potential state-of-the-art DL models, such as vision transformers and spiking neural networks, may find applications in this domain for real-time predictions and forecasting.
Outlook
The rapid growth of AI-based solutions has highlighted the potential benefits for the heat transfer community. The impact of these technologies will depend on the degree of active exploration by researchers into these exciting advancements in computer science. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the AI technologies discussed in this review are not independent attempts, but rather, share a symbiotic relationship (Fig.
1c
). Meta-regression analysis allows for holistic decision-making to find optimal two-phase heat and mass transfer performances. Physical feature extraction generates big data that has not been available in the past, which can advance our understanding and serve as the basis for new physical models. The knowledge gained from these attempts is instilled into data stream analysis models to demonstrate futuristic smart phase-change systems.
Future perspectives
Physics-centered machine learning
Quantifying the turbulent and spontaneous characteristics of the multi-phase physics involved with phase-change heat transfer processes with adequate quality that meets the demands of modern research has always posed a great challenge to researchers. Physical sensors or probes, which have been the gold standard for quantitative heat transfer characterizations so far, have limited spatial resolutions due to their genetic size. Besides that, optical measurement techniques such as infrared (IR) thermometry, fluorescence thermometry, and particle image velocimetry are limited to small domains and laboratory settings. On top of all this, there is no existing tool that can measure fluid and vapor properties simultaneously, which is crucial to understanding the underlying transport physics between the two phases. Although high-fidelity two-phase simulations have evolved over the past decades as an alternative solution to this problem, they are computationally expensive and often intractable without large-scale clusters or supercomputers.
The challenges associated with acquiring high-quality data might be addressed by leveraging AI or ML models that combine data with domain knowledge. Advances in ML models that incorporate known physics have demonstrated great potential to achieve accurate and interpretable results by satisfying both the observed data as well as the underlying physical laws
100
,
101
,
102
,
103
,
104
.In the context of phase-change heat transfer, the physics that domain experts can incorporate into ML models lies on such a wide spectrum, ranging from basic continuity equations to instability laws, that there exists abundant opportunities for researchers to explore integrating physics into their ML frameworks. An example of such implementations could be developing ML models that can use experimentally measured properties of one phase (e.g., vapor or liquid) and predict the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields of the other, which is the crux of many two-phase heat transfer problems. In such examples, the physics-respecting properties of ML models will allow domain experts to assess the model’s validity and reliability in a more interpretable manner when it extrapolates beyond the range of observed data. Therefore, we envision that the fusion of data-driven models and domain expertise presents a promising avenue for accelerating scientific discoveries by combining the advantages of both approaches.
Building cyberinfrastructures for two-phase heat transfer
Beyond answering core science questions, it is imperative to develop an array of cyberinfrastructure (CI) technologies (Fig.
1c
), including open-source and reusable data and scalable algorithms and software for long-term sustainability. The envisioned CI ecosystem should be agile and integrated to catalyze new transformative discoveries in heat transfer. This necessitates sustained community collaboration and continuous improvement at every stage.
Due to the nature of nonlinear, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal features during phase-change processes, it is critical to collect various datasets including meta-data, visual data, and transient data that cover different boundary and operating conditions. Unfortunately, collecting all dimensions of the data from computational and experimental efforts has not been addressed in this area. Therefore, it is critical to initiate data clusters following standard procedures discussed and defined by the community. This will enable researchers to access major assets (data and developed ML tools) that are stored in cloud environments and add their own to continue the phase-change cluster development.
In addition, technologies are needed to ensure the safe sharing of data since data owners take on risks when sharing their data with the research community. For example, CryptoNets88 allows neural networks to operate over encrypted data, ensuring that data remain confidential because decryption keys are not needed in neural networks
105
. At the same time, privacy methods must remain sufficiently explainable and transparent to help researchers correct them and make them safe, efficient, and accurate.
With the growth of training data and the complexity of deep learning models, scalable algorithms and software become necessities for solving large-scale problems and resolving fine-scale physics. Training a neural network is generally a time-consuming and challenging process, where the difficulty of the training process scales as the network becomes larger and deeper. Moreover, approaches that incorporate PDE-based soft regularization only add to this difficulty by making the loss landscape even harder to optimize. Accordingly, the benefits of the developed DL tools outweigh the high costs and challenges associated with their training only if the resulting models are generalizable and scalable. A promising approach to improving the scalability of trained models inspired by curriculum learning is to first train with simpler constraints and then couple pre-trained models using domain decomposition strategies to solve the target problem
45
. Another complementary approach is to build foundational models for ML models that embrace the “pre-train and fine-tune” paradigm for science problems. This paradigm has been highly successful in other domains and holds great promise in accelerating scientific advancements, enhancing model performance, and facilitating the efficient transfer of knowledge across related scientific domains. Building on this progress, creating reusable foundational models to learn unsteady single-phase physics in two-phase processes and coupling these models to make predictions for multi-physics phenomena presents one promising future direction for building a generalizable and sustainable CI.
Communicating across multiple disciplines
This review also elucidates the important role that AI can play in transferring knowledge between multiple disciplines, perhaps with emphasis on material and thermofluidic sciences. The nucleation phenomena described in this paper are highly dependent on surface properties (based on their structures and chemistry). Heat transfer performance can be enhanced using nano- or micro-materials that have desired heat and mass transfer properties. The comprehensive understanding about phase-change physics opens new opportunities for materials scientists in the context of materials design. In earlier studies, these processes were not efficient as scientists needed to search through a large range of materials and architectures, but now they can leverage AI-based design tools. For example, AI-assisted data mining toolkits like matminer have seen success in the material sciences by aiding the development and testing of new materials
106
. With access to new datasets, including metadata, visual data, and transient data, a novel collaboration between the heat transfer and materials science communities becomes feasible. We can formulate topology optimization models, explore inverse design techniques, and delve into the realm of multi-objective design as new dimensions in this research. During this process, building an additional layer of communications with computer and data scientists becomes essential. Many of the AI technologies discussed in this review are prototypes derived from successful models developed by computer scientists. These models can aid in the creation of task-specific new models for two-phase tasks. Data scientists can help develop and optimize data architectures that efficiently curate large data streams into meaningful features and identify important data features to address phase-change heat transfer. Successful studies through this convergence will provide a holistic description of phase-change heat transfer dynamics, enabling blueprints for next-generation phase-change thermal management designs. These new designs will, in turn, be translated to many applications, including energy conversion devices, two-phase electronics cooling devices, and water-energy surfaces.

Abstract
Defects dictate the properties of many functional materials. To understand the behaviour of defects and their impact on physical properties, it is necessary to identify the most stable defect geometries. However, global structure searching is computationally challenging for high-throughput defect studies or materials with complex defect landscapes, like alloys or disordered solids. Here, we tackle this limitation by harnessing a machine-learning surrogate model to qualitatively explore the structural landscape of neutral point defects. By learning defect motifs in a family of related metal chalcogenide and mixed anion crystals, the model successfully predicts favourable reconstructions for unseen defects in unseen compositions for 90% of cases, thereby reducing the number of first-principles calculations by 73%. Using CdSe
x
Te
1−
x
alloys as an exemplar, we train a model on the end member compositions and apply it to find the stable geometries of all inequivalent vacancies for a range of mixing concentrations, thus enabling more accurate and faster defect studies for configurationally complex systems.

. To discover better materials for these applications it is thus necessary to predict how their defects behave. However, defect calculations are computationally demanding. The large supercells and high level of theory required to obtain robust predictions typically limit point defect analysis to in-depth studies of specific materials. In a move towards data-driven defect workflows

19
,

. By learning the relationship between defect structure and properties, these models enable high-throughput studies that quickly evaluate and screen a group of materials based on their defect behaviour.
27
,

,
30
,
37
Despite progress in accelerating defect predictions, most high-throughput studies are limited in scope. Typically, their training datasets are generated assuming the ideal defect structure inherited from the crystal host, which often lies within a local minimum, thereby trapping a gradient-based optimisation algorithm in a metastable arrangement
38
,

,

. However, defect structure searching is often too expensive for high-throughput studies that target thousands of defects
30
or materials with complex (defect) energy landscapes, like alloys, disordered solids, and low-symmetry crystals.
In this study, we aim to reduce the computational burden of defect structure searching by introducing a machine-learning surrogate model. We build a dataset containing a set of point defect structures, energies, forces and stresses from first-principles, and use it to fine-tune a universal machine-learning force field (MLFF) and qualitatively explore the energy landscape across 132 defects. Defect reconstructions often follow common motifs
41
, especially when comparing similar defects in families of related compounds. By learning the plausible reconstructions undergone by defects in similar hosts, a surrogate model can be used to optimise the initial sampling structures and thus identify the promising, low-energy configurations (Fig.
1
), as previously shown for surface adsorbates
48
,
49
and transition state searches
50
.
Fig. 1: Schematic of a machine-learning surrogate model used to accelerate defect structure searching.
The computationally efficient model learns the plausible defect reconstructions (local minima in the potential energy surface) and thus reduces the number of candidate structures relaxed with expensive first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Results
To assess the ability of a surrogate model to learn defect reconstructions, we will focus on one of the most common — and often strongest in terms of energy-lowering — reconstruction motifs: dimerisation

To target dimerisation, we consider cation vacancies in low-symmetry metal sulfides/selenides, where their covalent character and soft structures favour dimer formation
41
,

,
56
. Our first-principles dataset spans 50 hosts (exemplified in Fig.

b) and 6 space groups. The configurational landscape of each vacancy was explored with the ShakeNBreak method
41
,
77
by applying 15 chemically-guided distortions to the unperturbed defect structure, followed by geometry optimisation with DFT (see Methods)—resulting in a diverse set of trajectories for each defect and the dataset shown in Fig.

Defect reconstructions
By analysing our first-principles dataset, we find that 29.9% of the neutral defects undergo symmetry-breaking reconstructions missed by both the standard modelling approach but
also
when applying a rattle distortion (with energy differences between the identified ground state and the relaxed ideal configuration greater than 0.5 eV; Supplementary Table
1
, Supplementary Fig.
1)
. Rattle distortions (i.e. randomised displacements) have been used in recent studies
37
as the prevalence of defect reconstructions have become more recognised. While rattling helps to break the symmetry of the initial defect configuration and escape PES saddle points, it often fails to identify reconstructions with significant energy barriers (i.e. bond formation), highlighting the need for structure searching.
The identified reconstructions are driven by anion–anion bond formation, with the number of new bonds determined by the number of valence electrons lost upon defect formation (Supplementary Fig.
2)
. In general, energy-lowering structural reconstructions at defects tend to be driven by the localisation of excess charge introduced by the defect formation, through various bonding (re-)arrangements. Here, excess charge refers to the change in valence electrons available for bonding, which is determined by the oxidation state of the original defect atom and the defect charge state—and in fact is the chemical guiding principle used in ShakeNBreak to target likely distortion pathways. For instance, upon forming a neutral antimony vacancy (
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Sb}}}}}}^{0}\)
) in Sb
2
(S/Se)
3
(where Sb is in the +3 oxidation state), we have removed three bonding electrons and so we have three excess holes. Further changes in the defect charge state will then alter this excess charge (e.g. 2 excess holes in the −1 charge state, or zero excess charge in the ‘fully-ionised’ -3 charge state). Similarly, for a neutral Li vacancy in Li
4
SnS
4
, we have removed 1 bonding electron and so we have 1 excess hole (and zero excess charge for the fully ionised -1 state). Analogously for an anion vacancy behaving as a donor defect (as in most semiconductors), it would contribute x excess electrons where -x is the oxidation state of the anion in that compound. Defects resulting in one hole (e.g.
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Li}}}}}}^{0}\)
in Li
4
SnS
4
) can easily accommodate the missing charge without strong reconstructions, while defects with two or more holes (e.g.
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Bi}}}}}}^{0}\)
in BiSI) tend to form anion dimers or trimers, as shown in Fig.
3
b. As a result, anion–anion bonds are more favourable for more positive defect charge states, and can stabilise unexpected defect oxidation states, as observed previously for
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Sb}}}}}}^{+1}\)
in Sb
2
(S/Se)
3
41
,
42
and
\({{{{{\rm{O}}}}}_{{{{\rm{i}}}}}}^{+1,+2}\)
in several metal oxides
41
,
55
,
58
.
There are some exceptions to this trend, where systems are able to accommodate three or more holes without undergoing strong reconstructions. One example is hosts with
d/f
metals that adopt multiple stable oxidation states (e.g. Fe, Co, Cu), which can accommodate a hole by adopting a higher oxidation state
8
. To verify this trend, we compared two isostructural A
III
B
I
S
2
systems which only differ in the identity of the B cation:
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Ga}}}}}}^{0}\)
in Ga
Cu
S
2
and Ga
Ag
S
2
; and
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{In}}}}}}^{0}\)
in In
Cu
S
2
and In
Ag
S
2
(Supplementary Fig.
3)
. In (Ga/In)
Ag
S
2
, two of the holes localise in a S–S bond formed by the vacancy nearest neighbours (NN), while the third hole is split between the remaining two NNs. In contrast, in (Ga/In)
Cu
S
2
, no dimer forms since three holes are localised in three of the vacancy NNs and five of the Cu ions closer to the vacancy — with these Cu ions showing shorter Cu–S bonds. The different behaviour of Cu and Ag can be rationalised by considering their second ionisation energies (I2(Cu): 20.3 eV, I2(Ag): 21.5 eV)
78
, where the low I2 (and thus higher
d
states) of Cu(I) favours cation oxidation, while the higher I2 of Ag(I) results in a sulfur dimer accommodating two of the holes (Supplementary Fig.
3)
.
In addition to systems with
d/f
elements, defects with nearby anion–anion bonds can localise the positive charge in these bonds and thus avoid forming new ones. This behaviour is exemplified by RhSe
2
, where the two symmetry-inequivalent Rh vacancies show different reconstructions. The first vacancy site is surrounded by four Se–Se bonds (Supplementary Fig.
4b)
, and thus can accommodate the four holes by depopulating the anti-bonding orbitals of these bonds. In contrast, the second site has only one Se–Se bond neighbouring the vacancy (Supplementary Fig.
4c)
, and thus has to form an additional Se dimer to accommodate the positive charge.
Beyond chalcogenide dimers, other rearrangements to accommodate positive charge involve chalco-halide (e.g. S–Cl formed by
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Bi}}}}}}^{0}\)
in AgBiSCl
2
) and halide-halide bond formation (e.g. Cl dimers formed by
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Sb}}}}}}^{0}\)
in SbSCl
9
) (Supplementary Fig.
5)
. Here we note that the zero-dimensional character of SbSCl
9
enables this defect to undergo strong distortions forming two Cl dimers (Supplementary Fig.
5)
. Overall, we highlight the common reconstruction motifs exhibited by different defects in various host structures (Supplementary Fig.
2)
, facilitating the requisite diversity for a model to learn the plausible reconstructions for a group of related defects.
Model training
To develop a model that can be applied for defect structure searching in
unseen
compositions, we first split our dataset by composition into training, validation and test sets (Supplementary Fig.
6)
, amounting to 68%, 5% and 27% of defects, respectively. The validation set is then augmented with 5% of the configurations selected for the systems in the training set, to ensure that the structural diversity of the training set is also included for validation (thus evaluating how the model performs for a large diversity of defects and compositions and also how it extrapolates to unseen compositions). This results in training, validation and test sets of 11,955 (63%), 2,100 (11%), and 4830 (26%) configurations, respectively, where configuration denotes a point defect structure with its associated energy, forces and stresses.
To sample the training data, we compared two approaches: (i) a manual method where we sample 10 evenly spaced frames from each relaxation (MS) and (ii) the Dimensionality-Reduced Encoded Clusters approach (DIRECT)
79
, which aims to select a robust training set from a complex configurational space. Surprisingly, we find that, when using datasets of similar sizes, the MS approach performs better—with the DIRECT approach only outperforming MS when the final DIRECT dataset is larger than the MS one (Supplementary Table
3)
. This is because the DIRECT approach mainly samples structures from the initial ionic steps (Supplementary Fig.
9)
, which correspond to high distortions and thus lead to larger errors for the low energy structures (Supplementary Fig.
10)
.
As a surrogate model, we aim for a method that takes an initial defect structure and outputs the energy and structure of the locally relaxed configuration. Machine-learning force fields are ideal for this task since they can map regions of the potential energy surface (PES) by learning the energies, forces, and, optionally stresses of a set of training structures. Specifically, we focus on universal graph-based MLFFs, which are trained on relaxation data from diverse databases of bulk crystals
80
,
81
,
82
,
83
, and thus already incorporate general chemical behaviour. Accordingly, we use a universal MLFF as a base model and fine-tune it with a training set of defect configurations. We have compared different model architectures (M3GNet
80
, CHGNet
81
and MACE
84
), elemental reference energies, structure featurisation parameters (graph cutoffs, readout layers) and fine-tuning strategies, which are discussed in detail in the
Supporting Information
(
SI)
(Supplementary Notes
1.B)
. In addition, we compared a model trained on just defect structures, and both defect and bulk structures, with the second case improving performance (Supplementary Table
10
and Supplementary Fig.
12)
. From these benchmarks, the optimal model architecture and parameters were selected: a M3GNet model
80
with radial and 3-body cutoffs of 5 Å and 4 Å, respectively, and the weighted atom readout function
80
,
85
(further details in Methods).
Overall, we note that the mean absolute errors for the
absolute
energies in the validation and test sets are significant (MAE
E,test
= 31.2 meV atom
−1
, Table 1), but comparable to those obtained in MLFFs used for bulk structure searching of carbon (MAE
E,test
= 64.8 meV atom
−1
)
86
. However, a more meaningful metric for our purpose is the error for the
relative
energies of each defect configuration relative to its ground state structure (MAE
E,rel,test
= 11.3 meV atom
−1
). Further, we mostly care about the low-energy region of the potential energy surface, which can be measured by calculating the relative energy errors for configurations less than ≈ 5 eV above the global minimum, resulting in MAEs of 3.6 meV atom
−1
≈ 0.29 eV for an 80 atom supercell.
Beyond these metrics, we calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient (
ρ
) to measure how well the MLFF and DFT energies are monotonically related (i.e. if greater DFT energies correspond to greater MLFF energies
87
). While the value of
ρ
for the test set is significantly lower than those obtained with MLFFs developed for
bulk
structure searching for a
single composition
(0.72 versus 0.98–0.999
87
), this was expected considering that our dataset spans a diverse range of compositions and a wide range of energies. While the errors are high, we note that this does not prevent the model from being used as a
qualitative
surrogate of the DFT PES for structure searching (i.e. identification of local minima), as previously observed for surface adsorbates
88
,
89
.
Model performance
To evaluate the model performance, we apply the trained model to a robust test set, which includes 13 unseen compositions and 32 defects (accounting for 26% and 26.5% of the total number of compositions and defects in our dataset, respectively; Supplementary Fig.
6)
. For each defect, the MLFF is used to relax the 15 distorted structures generated with ShakeNBreak
77
to sample the defect PES. The MLFF-relaxed structures are then compared to identify the different local minima in the MLFF PES using the SOAP fingerprint
90
of the defect site. These local minima are then further relaxed with DFT. By comparing the ground state identified from the MLFF+DFT approach and full DFT search, we find the former to correctly identify the DFT ground state for 88% of test defects, while simultaneously reducing the number of DFT calculations required by 73% (Table 2) and accelerating structure searching by a factor of 13 (Supplementary Notes
1.C4)
. In addition, it identifies a more favourable structure than the ones found in the DFT search for
V
Ge,9
in TlGeS
2
, with an energy lowering of 0.5 eV (Supplementary Fig.
15)
. The 12% of failed cases, where the MLFF ground state structure differed from the DFT one, mostly involve complex hosts. For instance,
\({V}_{{{{\rm{Sn}}}}}\)
in Li
4
SnS
4
has a complex DFT energy surface, which traps most of the relaxations in very high energy basins (Supplementary Fig.
19)
. PESs of similar complexity are displayed by the iso-structural systems that were included in the training set (Li
4
GeS
4
and Li
4
TiS
4
; Supplementary Fig.
19)
, which biases our training data to the high energy region of the PES for these compositions and thus hinders learning the low-energy region. Accordingly, the training data for these systems can be improved by reducing the magnitude of the distortion used by ShakeNBreak to generate their sampling structures; which would improve model performance. Other defects for which the surrogate model misses the most stable structure are
V
Tl,0
in TlGeS
2
and
V
Bi
in BiSeI — yet in both cases the DFT and MLFF+DFT structures are very similar and differ by small energy differences (0.1 and 0.2 eV, respectively) (Supplementary Figures
16
and
17)
. In all failed cases, while the model misses the full DFT ground state, it still correctly predicts a favourable reconstruction, that lowers the energy compared to the relaxed ideal configuration.
Beyond identifying the correct ground state in the majority of cases, the model has indirectly learned the correlation between the number of holes and the number of formed dimers. For defects with 1 missing electron, the candidate structures generated by the surrogate model rarely contained anion–anion bonds; while for defects with more missing electrons, the model often identifies at least one local minima with a dimer.
The decreased performance observed for out-of-sample compositions less similar to the training set posed the question of what performance could be achieved if targeting a family of more related systems. To consider more similar host compositions, we select the chalcohalide systems from our dataset and split them composition-wise into training, validation and test sets as described in Supplementary Notes
1.C5
. After training the model on the training set and applying it to the unseen test defects (details in Supplementary Notes
1.C5)
, we find that the model identifies the correct ground state for all test cases, and achieves lower mean absolute errors compared to the full model. This suggests that higher accuracy can be achieved when targeting more similar host structures, which is likely the case in most high-throughput defect studies.
Our current trained model is limited to neutral cation vacancies in metal sulphides/selenides. However, the approach can be extended to a different compositional space or defect type by first generating a custom training set through first-principles calculations and using it to fine-tune the universal bulk MLFF.
Application to alloys
Beyond high-throughput studies of many single-phase materials, the surrogate model can also be used to accelerate structure searching in alloys or disordered solids, which is computationally challenging due to the high number of local host compositions and inequivalent defects to consider
91
. The distinct local or site environments of a given defect can significantly affect its properties

. Properly sampling various site environments is key to characterise the defect behaviour in such cases.
We consider the case of cadmium vacancies in the CdSe

(

= 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1) pseudo-binary alloy. For each composition, a supercell is generated through random substitution of Te sites, and the Cd sites with a unique nearest neighbour chemical environment are considered (e.g. Cd surrounded by 4 Te; by 3 Te and 1 Se; by 2 Se and 2 Te, etc) (Fig.
4
a). The configurational landscape of each vacancy is explored with the ShakeNBreak method (14 sampling structures), using the relaxations from the pure compositions as the training and validation data while the mixed systems (0 <
x
< 1) are reserved as the test set.

identified through the finer MLFF+DFT search. These reconstructions are driven by either forming a dimer (e.g. Te–Te bond formation), forming a more favourable anion–anion bond (Te–Te instead of Se–Te; Se–Te instead of Se–Se) or forming the same type of anion bond (Se-Se) but breaking weaker anion-cation bonds between the defect nearest neighbours and the defect next nearest neighbours.
Full size image
After fine-tuning the surrogate model (MLFF) on the training configurations (details in Methods), it is applied to all alloys to perform the structure searching calculations, allowing a more extensive sampling than for the DFT search (31 sampling structures). From the MLFF-relaxed structures, the unique configurations are selected for further relaxation with DFT and compared with the results from the DFT-only search. This comparison shows that the model successfully identifies the ground state for all defects, even in cases where the defects form Te-Se bonds not seen in the training set – which only included the Te-Te and Se-Se bonds formed by
V
Cd
(CdTe) and
V
Cd
(CdSe), respectively. Although Te-Se bonds were not present in our defect training set, they were included in the Materials Project (bulk) training set, thus suggesting the benefit of transfer learning for model generalisability.
More significantly, for 70% of the defects, the model identifies a more favourable ground state missed in the coarser DFT search (with a mean energy lowering of −0.4 eV, Supplementary Notes
1.E)
. These reconstructions are driven by forming a more favourable anion–anion bond (Fig.
4
b) and missed in the DFT-only search due to the coarser sampling performed. This illustrates the advantage of the faster surrogate model to tackle defects with complex configurational landscapes, that require a more exhaustive exploration than a DFT-based search would allow, like alloys, compositionally disordered materials
104
,
105
,
106
,
107
, and low-symmetry or multinary systems with many degrees of freedom in their PES.
Discussion
By building a dataset for defect structure searching, we have demonstrated the prevalence of defect reconstructions missed by the standard modelling approach – and thus the need to perform structure searching in high-throughput defect studies. To reduce the associated computational burden, we have developed a surrogate model by fine-tuning a universal machine-learning force field on defect configurations. By qualitatively learning the defect configurational landscapes, the trained model successfully predicts low-energy defect structures for
unseen
defect environments in
unseen
compositions, thereby reducing the number of DFT calculations by 73%. While our current model is limited to neutral cation vacancies in metal chalcogenides, the methodology can be applied to different defect types or compositional spaces. In addition, our openly-available dataset could be used to measure the out-of-distribution performance of universal MLFFs
108
by testing the ability to extrapolate from learned bulk motifs to defect environments.
Beyond accelerating structure searching in high-throughput studies, this approach is ideal for systems with a complex defect landscape, like alloys, disordered, or low-symmetry materials where their many inequivalent defects make it intractable to explicitly calculate all of them with accurate DFT methods. By using a surrogate model, we can consider a range of alloy compositions and all inequivalent defects, while performing a more exhaustive sampling of the PES — thereby identifying more favourable reconstructions missed in the (coarser) DFT-based search. Beyond (pseudo-)binary alloys, this approach could be extended to model more chemically complex systems, like high-entropy alloys, where the MLFF could be trained on defects of the constituent binary systems and applied to the ternary, quaternary, or high-entropy alloys.
A current limitation of this strategy is the handling of defects in distinct charge states, which have different energy landscapes and structural configurations (e.g. a defect in two different charge states can have a common local structure with different energies). The approach could handle the potential energy landscape for each charge state independently (e.g. training a separate model for defects in the -1 charge state). To consider different charge states simultaneously, the net charge state can be encoded as a graph global attribute
109
. However, a more descriptive encoding could be achieved by using fourth-generation MLFFs that include atomic charges
110
. Beyond accounting for the defect charge, another improvement could be MLFFs that are fine-tuned on-the-fly during geometry optimisations. As shown for surface absorbates
88
,
89
, this strategy would accelerate the defect geometry optimisation by skipping many ionic steps that are performed with the surrogate model. Overall, we note the promise of surrogate models to accelerate and increase the accuracy of defect modelling, whether this is by improving structure searching, accounting for metastable configurations
111
,
112
, enabling the calculation of defect formation entropies
109
,
112
, accelerating defect migration studies

or going beyond the dilute limit

Methods
High-throughput vacancies in chalcogenide hosts
The conventional supercell approach for modelling defects in periodic solids was used
114
. To reduce periodic image interactions, supercell dimensions of at least 10 Å in each direction
115
were employed. To explore the configurational landscape of each defect, we used the ShakeNBreak code
77
, with a distortion increment of 0.1 and the default rattle standard deviation (10% of the nearest neighbour distance in the bulk supercell). This strategy results in 14 sampling structures. In addition to these, to ensure that dimerisation was properly sampled, we also generated a sampling structure where two defect neighbours were pushed towards each other with a separation of 2 Å, resulting in a total of 15 initial configurations. Due to the limitation of universal MLFFs to describe charge, we only considered one charge state of the defects. We chose the neutral state for several reasons. First, it is often stable for cation vacancies in metal chalcogenides. Secondly, it is usually included within the potential charge states to be calculated for a given defect (e.g. generally ranging from the fully ionised state to (at least) the neutral one), and it often has a complex potential energy landscape. However, we note that we did not check whether it was the thermodynamically stable state for each defect.
All reference calculations were performed with Density Functional Theory using the exchange-correlation functional HSE06
116
and the projector augmented wave method
117
, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package
118
,
119
. Calculations for the pristine unit cells were performed using a plane wave energy cutoff of 585 eV and sampling reciprocal space with a Monkhorst-Pack mesh of density 900
k
-points/site. The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimisations were set to 10
−6
eV and 10
−5
eV Å
−1
for energy and forces, respectively. Defect relaxations were performed with the Γ-point approximation, which is accurate enough for defect structure searching
41
, and with a plane wave energy cutoff of 350 eV. The energy and force thresholds for defect relaxations were set to 10
−4
eV and 10
−2
eV Å
−1
, respectively. We note that these settings were selected for an efficient exploration of the defect configurational landscape due to the high number of relaxations required for structure searching. In a full defect study aiming for high accuracy, once the ground state configuration is identified with these settings, it should be further relaxed with tighter convergence thresholds and account for spin-orbit coupling when necessary (elements from period five/six and below).

. The datasets and trained models are available from the Zenodo repository with
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10579527
.
To generate the training and test set for the machine learning model, we processed the DFT defect relaxation data by removing unreasonably high-energy configurations (e.g. structures with positive energies), as they decreased model performance. After cleaning the data, 10 evenly-spaced ionic steps were selected from each relaxation. We used the M3GNet model
80
, as implemented in ref.
85
, with radial and 3 body cutoffs of 5 Å and 4 Å, respectively, and the weighted atom readout function. The loss function was defined as a combination of the mean squared errors for the energies, forces and stresses, with respective weights of 1, 1 and 0.1
80
,
85
. For fine-tuning, the model was initialised with the weights from the trained bulk crystal model
85
and then trained on the defect training set (see Supplementary Notes
1.B5
for further details). A batch size of 4 and an exponential learning rate scheduler with an initial rate of 5 × 10
−4
were used. The model was trained on a Quadro RTX6000 GPU until the validation errors were converged (30 epochs, 5.3 hours) (Supplementary Fig.
13)
.
MLFF geometry optimisation was performed with the FIRE algorithm
130
, as implemented in the ASE package
128
, until the mean force was lower than 10
−5
eV Å
−1
or the number of ionic steps exceeded 1500, which were found to be reasonable thresholds. After relaxing the sampling structures with the model, we identified the different local minima or configurations by calculating the cosine distance between the SOAP descriptor
90
for the defect site of each configuration, which was found to be an effective metric for identifying different defect motifs. We note that using the SOAP fingerprint of the defect site was more robust than considering the energies or the root mean squared displacement between the structures. The first case can miss local minima if these have similar energies in the MLFF PES, while the second was more sensitive to structural differences far from the defect site. The parameters used to generate the SOAP descriptor were:

To evaluate the correlation between DFT and MLFF energies, the Spearman coefficient was calculated for each defect
independently
, and then averaged across defects.
Application to the CdSe
x
Te
(1−x)
alloy
To generate the supercells for the mixed compositions in CdSe
x
Te
(1−x)
(
x
= 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9), we used random substitution of Te sites with Se. For each supercell, we consider the Cd sites with a unique nearest neighbour chemical environment as vacancy sites (e.g. Cd surrounded by 4 Te; by 3 Te and 1 Se; by 2 Se and 2 Te etc), and generate the vacancy high-symmetry structures with pymatgen
123
,
124
,
125
. For the DFT-based exploration of the PES, we apply ShakeNBreak with default parameters, generating 14 sampling structures, which were relaxed with DFT as previously described.
To generate the dataset, we again processed the defect relaxation data by removing unreasonably high-energy configurations (>15 eV above the defect ground state configuration). As the training set, we used a combination of defect and bulk configurations: 45 evenly-spaced frames from the 14 relaxations of
V
Cd
in CdTe and CdSe, and 20 frames from the relaxations of each pristine system, resulting in a total of 1420 frames. For validation, we selected 5 unseen configurations from the 14 relaxations of
V
Cd
in CdTe and CdSe (total of 140 frames). The M3GNet surrogate model was trained with similar parameters as previously described and until the errors were converged (80 epochs, see Supplementary Fig.
26)
.
To perform a finer exploration of the PES with the surrogate model, we applied a set of bond distortions generated by ShakeNBreak (−0.6, −0.5, −0.4, −0.3, −0.2) to all unique pair combinations of nearest neighbours (e.g. for a
V
Cd
surrounded by two Te and two Se anions, Te(1), Te(2), Se(1) and Se(2), we considered the pairs Te(1)-Te(2), Te(1)-Se(1), Te(1)-Se(2), Te(2)-Se(1), Te(2)-Se(2), and Se(1)-Se(2)). By default, for a defect with two missing electrons like
\({{V}_{{{{\rm{Cd}}}}}}^{0}\)
, ShakeNBreak only applies the bond distortions to the two atoms closest to the defect. This is typically a reliable approach for most
pure
systems, but can miss reconstructions for alloys with complex defect environments (e.g.
V
Cd
surrounded by a mix of Te and Se anions). The model application and analysis were performed as described in the previous section.

Two-dimensional materials
Abstract
The discovery of novel two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials is attractive due to their potential for the realization of information storage and logic devices. Although many approaches have been explored to simultaneously introduce ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) orders into a 2D material, the resulting systems are often plagued by weak magnetoelectric (ME) coupling or limited room-temperature stability. Here, we present a superlattice strategy to construct non-centrosymmetric AM

4
multiferroic monolayers, i.e., intercalating transition metal ions (A) into the tetragonal-like vacancies of transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers (MX
2
). Starting from 960 intercalated AM
2
X
4
compounds, our high-throughput calculations have identified 21 multiferroics with robust magnetic order, large FE polarization, low transition barrier, high FE/FM transition temperature, and strong ME coupling. According to the origin of magnetism, we have classified them into twelve type-
a
, seven type-
b
, and two type-
c
multiferroics, which exhibit different ME coupling behavior. During the switching of polarization, the reversal of skyrmions chirality, the transition of the magnetic ground state from FM to antiferromagnetic, and the changes in spin-polarized electron distribution were observed in type-
a
, type-
b
, and type-
c
2D multiferroic materials, respectively. These results substantially expand the family of 2D ferroic materials and pave an avenue for designing and implementing nonvolatile logic and memory devices.

Introduction
With the rapid development of information technology and increasing demand for the miniaturization of devices, two-dimensional (2D) materials with low power consumption, high storage density, and integration have become the focus of intensive research
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
. Among them, 2D multiferroics combine the advantages of multiple ferroic orders and hold promise in multi-stage storage and nonvolatile logic devices
5
,
6
,
7
. They are a special class of materials that simultaneously exhibit two or more primary ferroic orders, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, ferroelasticity, and ferrovalley, and there exists coupling between them, which can be mutually controlled. In particular, the coupling between ferroelectric (FE) and ferromagnetic (FM) orders leads to the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling effect, which offers a unique opportunity to control the spin by applying an electric field. This kind of ME coupling could be used to develop new-generation memory devices in which data can be written electrically and read magnetically, avoiding the drawback of high writing energy in conventional magnetic random-access memory
8
,

,

.
Depending on the microscopic FE mechanism, multiferroic materials can be divided into two categories, i.e., type-I and type-II. In type-I multiferroics, the ferroelectricity and magnetism originate from different atoms. The coupling between electric dipoles and magnetic spins is mediated by spin-lattice interaction, usually leading to weak ME coupling, but often exhibits considerable spontaneous polarization and high transition temperature. To date, several type-I multiferroics such as CrN

have been predicted theoretically, while multiferroic has been confirmed experimentally in 2D CuCrP
2
S

14
. In type-II multiferroics, FE order generally arises from special magnetic order, and the direct correlation between polarization and magnetization promises strong ME coupling. Generally, special magnetic order, such as spiral or complex collinear magnetic order, could lead to spin and charge frustration, which significantly reduces the intensity of FE polarization and transition temperature.

17
monolayers are predicted to exhibit 120° non-collinear Y-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin spiral orders, which can induce FE polarization perpendicular to the spin spiral plane. The polarization switching can realize the reversal of the spin spiral chirality in MnRe
2
O

and VX
2
monolayers, demonstrating strong magnetoelectric coupling behavior. In addition, Bao et al. theoretically demonstrated that synthesized FeOCl monolayer has a cycloidal spin spiral with a propagation vector of (0.274, 0.5, 0) located in the
ac
plane, and the induced out-of-plane ferroelectricity can switch the spin spiral chirality through an electric field
18
. There was also experimental evidence that the NiI
2
monolayer exhibited proper screw state with a given handedness coupled to the charge degrees of freedom, producing a chirality-controlled electric polarization with a transition temperature of 21 K
19
. Since both type-I and type-II multiferroics have advantages and shortcomings, continuous search for single-phase 2D multiferroic materials with excellent FE–FM multiferroic properties, i.e., strong ME coupling, high Curie temperature, and FE polarization intensity, is still a challenge for this fast-growing field.
Intercalation is a chemical process in which foreign species insert into crystal gaps to eventually form hybrid intercalation compounds. In 2D layered materials with van der Waals (vdW) gap, intercalation reaction has been proven as a powerful approach for synthesizing single-phase crystals with the coexistence of multiple order parameters
20
. A family of 2D MA
2

materials was obtained by intercalating a MoS

monolayer into InSe-type A

is an AFM axion/Chern insulator with quantized anomalous Hall conductivity

. In addition, the Kagome lattice formed by Ta
8
Se
12
(66.7% Ta-intercalated) stabilizes the charge-density-wave and exhibits FM metallicity
20
, while Cr-intercalated 2H-TaS
2
(Cr
1/3
TaS
2
) is a chiral crystal, which has a helical spin texture and continuously transforms into a chiral soliton lattice, eventually reaches a forced FM state under an external magnetic field
26
. In addition, 2D AgCrS
2
composed of Ag intercalated CrS
2
bilayers has been experimentally demonstrated to be stable and exhibit superionic and FM behavior at room temperature
27
,
28
. Briefly speaking, intercalation breaks the inversion symmetry of the system, changes the bonding order from vdW to ionic or covalent type, and modulates the band structures of the host lattice and intercalated species.
Inspired by the exotic properties triggered by unique intercalated architectures, herein we propose a general approach to systematically design 2D multiferroic materials by non-centrosymmetric intercalation of 3

ferroelectrics with low FE switching barrier (<200 meV/f.u.). Among them, different magnetic orders such as FM, AFM, and ferrimagnetic (FiM) are identified in the 21 FE systems. Depending on the position of the magnetic ions (intercalated A ions or host M atoms), we classify these 21 multiferroics into three types and investigate their different ME coupling behavior. Our intercalation strategy opens an avenue to develop novel 2D materials with multiferroic properties and explores other fascinating topological phenomena.

Screening of 2D non-centrosymmetric intercalated compounds
Transition metal disulfide compounds (TMDs) are a series of layered crystals with a chemical formula MX
2
(M = transition metal, X = S/Se/Te), in which the neighboring MX
2
layers interact weakly with each other via vdW interaction. Such weak interlayer interaction means that different thicknesses of ultrathin TMD films can be obtained in experiments using exfoliation approaches. In general, MX
2
monolayers crystallize into three main phases: 1T (triangular) phase with
D
3d
symmetry, 2H (hexagonal) phase with
D
3h
symmetry, and distorted 1T phase (1T’ phase). Some MX
2
with 1T and 2H phases exhibit tunable band gaps, high carrier mobility, and strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, making them attractive candidates in electronic, optical, and spintronic devices
30
. Owing to the existence of the vdW gap, the MX
2
compounds can be easily intercalated by atoms, molecules, or atomic layers, and their properties can also be modulated via intercalation. For example, previous studies have shown that after the intercalation of Ag ions into a 2H–CrS
2
bilayer or of Cu into a 2H-CrX
2
(X = S/Se) bilayer, the intercalation compounds AgCrX
2
and CuCrX

transits to multiferroic state due to the breaking of inversion symmetry by Ag/Cu ions

,
31
; 2D CoMo
2
S
4
also shows multiferroic behavior as the Co ions are intercalated into the 1T-MoS
2
bilayer and the two FE ground states are energetically degenerate with opposite chirality of the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI)
29
.
Inspired by these results, we have constructed a series of hybrid intercalation compounds using 2H or 1T phase MX
2
bilayers with AB stacking as host lattice and A atoms as guest species. When the intercalated A atoms uniformly occupy the tetragonal-like vacancies in the interlayer space of bilayer MX
2
, an A atom coordinates with one X atom from the top layer and three X atoms from the bottom layer. This leads to an unequal distance between A and the two MX
2
layers, thereby breaking the central inversion symmetry of the system and generating spontaneous polarization. The tetrahedral crystal field can be switched by a 180° rotation when an A ion bonds with three X atoms in the top layer and one X atom in the bottom layer, leading to polarization reversal. The selection of the MX
2
layer and A atoms is summarized in Supplementary Table
1
, and a total of 960 non-centrosymmetric intercalation compounds were obtained with all combinations of the MX
2
layer and A atom. The representative crystal structures of 2H phase compounds AM

systems. Firstly, we performed a full structural optimization to confirm that the intercalated A ions in all 960 AM
2
X
4
compounds deviated from the center position and caused spontaneous polarization. Secondly, we evaluated the dynamic and thermodynamic stabilities of these AM
2
X
4
compounds by computing their phonon dispersion and formation energy. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig.
1
, there is no negative frequency throughout the entire Brillouin zone of 104 2D AM
2
X
4
compounds. Among them, the formation energies of 100 systems are negative (Supplementary Table
2
), indicating that they are dynamically and thermodynamically stable at ambient conditions. Thirdly, the smaller the FE switching barrier, the less energy is consumed for polarization reversal. Hence, we set a convergence criterion for the polarization reversal barrier of 200 meV/f.u., which is equivalent to ~
k
B
T per atom at ambient conditions. It is noteworthy that we have reproduced the previously reported T-AgCr

. Thus, these systems will not be further discussed in the rest of this paper. Fourthly, for the remaining 40 FE candidates after step-three screening, we considered two possible antiferroelectric (AFE) states in a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell to determine their FE ground states (Supplementary Fig.
2
and Supplementary Table
3
). The FE states were more stable than the AFE states for most compounds, except that T-CoTi
2
Te

prefers an AFE ground state. However, the AFE and FE phases of T-CoTi
2
Te
4
are separated by a switching energy barrier of about 219.44 meV/f.u. (Supplementary Fig.
3
), which is high enough to prevent a spontaneous FE-to-AFE transition at room temperature. Therefore, the FE phase of T-CoTi
2
Te
4
can still exist as a metastable state. In conclusion, we screen out 40 previously unknown members of stable 2D FE materials. Their electronic, magnetic, and ME coupling properties will be investigated further.

are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.35, 0.14, 0.20, and 0.04 eV, respectively. In T-CdSc
2
Se

and T-CdRh
2
S
4
, both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are dominated by the ScSe

and T-CoY
2

are mainly contributed by the S atoms and the CBMs stem mainly from the intercalated Co atoms (Supplementary Fig.

). Apart from the four semiconductors mentioned above, other intercalation compounds exhibit metallic or half-metallic behavior, since the 3
d

d
orbitals of the intercalated transition metal ions are usually partially occupied and exhibit strong itinerant characteristics. Based on this finding, we will discuss the intrinsic FE behavior of semiconductors and metals/half-metals separately in the following content.

evaluated by the dipole correction approach are 15.22 (0.13), 9.32 (0.06), 11.35 (0.08), and 13.62 (0.12) pC/m (eÅ). These values are comparable to the typical 2D FE semiconductor In

32
. Similar to In
2
Se

, the interesting intercorrelated in-plane and out-of-plane ferroelectricity may also occur in these 2D FE semiconductors, where the out-of-plane electric field used to reverse the
P

also reverses the
P
in
, which has great potential for advanced memory devices and multi-directional controlled field-effect transistors

.
For metals or half-metals, there is only a
P
out
as the
P
in
is annihilated by free electrons. Using metallic T-PdZr
2
Se
4
as an example, we discuss the mechanism of coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity. The metallic behavior of T-PdZr
2
Se
4
was confirmed by calculating the electronic band structure, as displayed in Fig.
3a, b
. The conduction electrons
\({\rho }_{c}(\text{z})\)
calculated by Eq. (
3
) are mainly distributed in the top and bottom ZrSe
2
layers (Fig.
3c
), which is consistent with the projected density of states (PDOS) results (Fig.
3b
). However, the polarization electrons
\({\rho }_{P}(\text{z})\)
obtained by Eq. (
5
) are mainly distributed around the intercalated Pd atoms and exhibit an oscillatory behavior (Fig.
3c
), which is related to the non-uniform charge density distribution caused by the bonding difference between the Pd and the top and bottom Se atoms. The different distribution between polarization and conduction electrons prevents the annihilation of
P
out
, where the conduction electrons distributed around the Zr atoms on the bottom layer cannot fully screen the vertical polarization originating from the intercalating Pd atom. Therefore, ferroelectricity and metallic behavior can coexist in T-PdZr
2
Se
4
, with a
P
out
of 3.10 pC/m. This mechanism is also responsible for the
P
out
of other sixteen non-magnetic FE compounds with metallic or half-metallic behavior, as summarized in Table
1

For the 40 selected FE materials, we further examined their magnetic ground states by comparing the total energy of FM with various types of AFM or FiM configurations. Among them, 21 systems exhibit both ferroelectricity and magnetism, including ten FM, nine AFM, and two FiM members (Table
2
). It is worth noting that the presence of magnetism does not eliminate out-of-plane FE behavior in these intercalation compounds, even for metallic systems. For example, in T-CoTi
2
Te
4
, the contributions from the top and bottom TiTe
2
layers to the conduction electrons are similar in the spin-up channel, while the conduction electrons in the spin-down channel originate from the top TiTe
2
layer (Fig.
3e, f
). In contrast, the polarization charge density mainly accumulates around the intercalated Co atoms, as displayed in Fig.
3f
. The different origins of the two types of charges ensure the possibility of
P
out
in metallic 2D FE systems, no matter whether the system exhibits magnetism.

In the following, we focus on the 21 intercalation materials with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism and perform a detailed analysis of their magnetism and ME coupling effects. For simplicity, we classify the 21 systems into three types according to the origin of magnetism: (i) type-
a
, in which the magnetism of the system originates from the magnetic atoms M in the top and bottom MX
2
layers; (ii) type-
b
, in which the magnetism originates from the intercalated A atoms; (iii) type-
c
, in which both the M atoms in the MX
2
layers and the intercalated A atoms provide magnetism simultaneously.

, are obtained by inserting Pd/Cu/Ag/Zn/Cd atoms into T-CrX
2
, T-MnX
2
, or T-TcX
2
bilayers. The intercalated A (A = Pd, Cu, Zn, Ag, and Cd) atoms with almost completely occupied 3
d
/4
d
orbitals do not contribute to magnetism, while the 3
d
orbitals of M (M = Cr, Mn, and Tc) atoms are partially filled, with more localized electrons and larger magnetic moments. Therefore, the magnetism comes from the M atoms in the MX
2
bilayers, and the special bonding of the intercalated A atom results in negligible differences in the magnetic moments of the M atoms in the top and bottom layers (~0.1
µ
B
).
The Heisenberg model was adopted to describe the magnetic interaction:
$$H=-\sum _{i,j}{J}_{i,j}{S}_{i}\cdot {S}_{j}-{A}_{z}\sum _{i}{\left({S}_{i}^{z}\right)}^{2}$$
(1)
where
S
i
and
S
j
are the magnetic moments at
i
and
j
sites, respectively,
J
ij
is the magnetic exchange coupling parameter between
i
and
j
sites,
A
z
is the single-ion anisotropic energy, and the sum over
i
and
j
passes through all the magnetic ions. Considering the possible magnetic exchange interaction between the top and bottom MX
2
layers, exchange interactions up to the fifth nearest neighbors are involved by comparing the energies of FM and different AFM configurations (Supplementary Fig.
7a
and Supplementary Table
4
). Here
\({J}_{1}^{\text{intra}}\)
,
\({J}_{2}^{\text{intra}}\)
, and
\({J}_{3}^{\text{intra}}\)
represent the intralayer coupling, while
\({J}_{1}^{\text{inter}}\)
and
\({J}_{2}^{\text{inter}}\)
are the interlayer interactions, as summarized in Supplementary Table
5
. Taking T-CdCr
2
Te
4
as a representative,
\({J}_{1}^{\text{intra}}\)
and
\({J}_{3}^{\text{intra}}\)
contribute most significantly to FM state, which can be explained by the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules
37
, while the effect of
\({J}_{2}^{\text{intra}}\)
is too weak to affect the intralayer FM order. As for the interlayer magnetic interactions, both
\({J}_{1}^{\text{inter}}\)
and
\({J}_{2}^{\text{inter}}\)
favor FM order. Therefore, the Cr–Cr pairs in the intralayer and interlayer exhibit FM interactions. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) is also an important parameter for characterizing the magnetic properties of a system, as a larger MAE can maintain long-range magnetic order against thermal fluctuation. It is defined as the energy difference between the magnetic configurations with in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization: MAE =
E
in-plane
−
E
out-plane
. Hence, a positive (negative) MAE represents an out-of-plane (in-plane) easy magnetization axis. The calculated MAE of T-CdCr
2
Te
4
is −0.34 meV/Cr, indicating an in-plane magnetization orientation. Based on the magnetic coupling parameters and MAE, we performed MC simulations with the Heisenberg model to estimate the Curie temperature. As displayed in Supplementary Fig.
8a
, T-CdCr
2
Te
4
shows intrinsic FM order with a Curie temperature of 260 K, close to room temperature.
We performed AIMD simulations on T-CdCr
2
Te
4
at different temperatures to examine the FE stability by analyzing the displacement of intercalated Cd atoms relative to the centrosymmetric position along the out-of-plane direction. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
8b
, the average displacement of the Cd atoms (
\(\bar{d}\)
Cd
) in
z
-direction follows a Gaussian distribution. At
T
= 250 K,
\(\bar{d}\)
Cd
= 0.376 Å represents a macroscopic FE phase. When the temperature reaches
T
= 300 and 350 K,
\(\bar{d}\)
Cd
rapidly decreases to 0.020 and 0.013 Å, respectively, and the peak position gradually moves toward zero and approaches the non-polar phase. This indicates that the FE transition temperature of 2D T-CdCr
2
Te
4
is above room temperature and exhibits good multiferroic stability, as the FM transition temperature is close to room temperature (260 K). In addition, when
T
= 250 K, T-CdCr
2
Te
4
remains in a stable structural configuration, and the intercalated atoms always remain at the tetrahedral site as shown in Supplementary Fig.
9a
. At a temperature of 300 K, there is a change in the stacking mode due to thermodynamic disturbance, and a centrosymmetric non-polar state is formed (Supplementary Fig.
9b
). This further confirms that the FE switching temperature of T-CdCr
2

is around room temperature and has good thermodynamic stability.

with AFM order reaching −2.49 meV/Tc, and T-AgTc
2
S
4
with an in-plane easy magnetization axis shows an MAE as high as 2.09 meV/Tc.
Additionally, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry guarantees Heisenberg exchange interactions, while the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by heavy Te element, along with the intrinsic inversion symmetry breaking from atoms, resulting in a significant DMI, naturally causing the formation of magnetic skyrmions. Therefore, we investigated the DMI of two equivalent FE phases and explored the possible topological magnetic texture and ME coupling behavior in T-CdCr
2
Te
4
. After considering DMI, the spin Hamiltonian can be rewritten as follows:
$${H}_{\text{spin}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i < j}{J}_{\text{ij}}{\vec{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}_{{\bf{i}}}\cdot {\vec{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}_{{\bf{j}}}+{A}_{\text{z}}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\text{i}}{\left({S}_{\text{i}}^{\text{z}}\right)}^{2}+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i < j}{\vec{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}_{{\bf{ij}}}\cdot ({\vec{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}_{{\bf{i}}}\times {\vec{{\boldsymbol{S}}}}_{{\bf{j}}})$$
(2)
where the magnetic coupling parameter
\({J}_{\text{ij}}\)
can be extracted by the four-state energy mapping method
38
, and
\({\vec{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}_{{\bf{ij}}}=[{D}_{\text{ij}}^{\text{x}},{D}_{\text{ij}}^{\text{y}},{D}_{\text{ij}}^{\text{z}}]\)
is the DMI vector. The DMI components between the nearest Cr-Cr pairs of the top and bottom Cr layers have opposite directions (Fig.
4
a,
h
). Since
\({\vec{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}_{{\bf{ij}}}\)
is a directional vector, we calculated
\({J}_{\text{ij}}\)
and
\({\vec{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}_{{\bf{ij}}}\)
along
x
,
y
, and
xy
directions for the first nearest neighbor Cr-Cr pairs of the top and bottom layers, respectively, as shown in Table
3
and Fig.
4
. In the FE1 state, the
D
value for the top Cr layer is roughly triple that of the bottom layer, but this is inverted in the FE2 state, suggesting that DMI is very sensitive to structural asymmetry. Moreover, the
D
/|
J
| ratios of the top and bottom Cr layers in the FE1 state are about 9.03% and 20.66%, respectively, which shift to 20.80% and 9.52% in the FE2 state. Such a large DMI and
D
/|
J
| ratio may give rise to peculiar topological magnetic textures like magnetic skyrmions. At the same time,
D
/|
J
| values of the top and bottom Cr layers in the FE1 and FE2 states change with the switching of polarization. Therefore, one expects that FE polarization can regulate the topological magnetic behavior in different Cr layers.

To verify this speculation, we performed MC simulations for T-CdCr
2
Te
4
in FE1 and FE2 states. The results are presented in Fig.
4
, showing a wealth of topological magnetic excitations. As shown in Fig.
4b
, the top Cr layer in the FE1 state displays a labyrinth-like spin texture (stripe domains) under low external fields (0 ~ 1.0 T), and the edge of the stripe domains wall becomes blurred with the increase of out-of-plane magnetic field strength. As the applied magnetic field reaches 2.4 T, the domain structure disintegrates, and anti-skyrmions appear (Fig.
4c
), which can be maintained under a magnetic field of 2.4–3.17 T. Moreover, the diameter of anti-skyrmions decreases as the magnetic field increases, i.e., from 8.9 nm at 2.4 T to 3.8 nm at 3.17 T, which is much smaller than the reported diameters of 2D Cr(I, Cl)

(77 nm at 0.2 T)
40
, and the typical size of skyrmions in thin films (10–100 nm)
41
. Compared to domain walls in racetrack memory, the smaller size of skyrmions allows for faster data flow or higher data throughput with the same current density, resulting in higher information density. Therefore, T-CdCr
2
Te
4
stands out as an excellent candidate for low-power consumption spintronic devices. As the magnetic field exceeds 3.5 T, the anti-skyrmions vanish, and the FM state becomes favorable (Fig.
4f
). In other words, the spin structure of 2D T-CdCr
2
Te
4
undergoes a phase transition with increasing magnetic field: stripe domain → skyrmion lattice → FM phase.
Unlike the top Cr layer, the lower Cr layer exhibits no topological magnetic properties in any magnetic field, which can be attributed to the difference in DMI between the top and bottom Cr layers. During the FE2 state, the top Cr layer behaves FM phase, while the bottom layer shows a phase transition akin to the top layer in the FE1 state, and the anti-skyrmions disappear as the magnetic field reaches 3.7 T, as illustrated in Fig.
4i-n
. This indicates that the magnetic behavior of the top and bottom layers is reversed by polarization switching. Remarkably, the MX
2
layer shows skyrmions with opposite chirality under different polarization directions (Fig.
4
f,
m
), indicating that the FE polarization reversal can not only reversibly generate and annihilate magnetic skyrmions but also achieve chirality reversal of skyrmions, demonstrating interesting ME coupling phenomena.
So far, numerous theoretical and experimental studies have focused on controlling magnetic skyrmions via FE, most of which are based on heterostructures composed of FM and FE layers, where the topological magnetism of the FM layer is manipulated by polarization reversal of the FE layer
42
,
43
,
44
,
45
. To the best of our knowledge, there was a theoretical proposal of manipulating the magnetic skyrmions in the intercalation compound CoMo
2
S
4
29
, similar to the present study, where the chirality of skyrmions was tailored by FE polarization reversal in the intermediate Co layer. However, this differs from our strategy in which the modulation of topological magnetic textures occurs in the top and bottom CrTe
2
layers. In other words, this work provides an approach to polarization-controlled topological magnetism.
We further investigated the effects of temperature and magnetic field on the topological spin textures of T-CdCr
2
Te
4
monolayer. The magnetic behavior of T-CdCr
2
Te
4
with temperature and magnetic field evolution is displayed in Fig.
5
. At low temperatures (0 K ≤ T < 40 K), the system maintains a stripe domain phase within a small external magnetic field, evolving into a skyrmion lattice with the rise in magnetic field. It should be noted that the critical strengths of the magnetic field required for the formation and disappearance of skyrmions decrease as temperature increases. For example, anti-skyrmions emerge at B = 2.1 T and persist until B = 3.17 T at zero temperature, but at T = 25 K, they appear in an external magnetic field of 1.85 T and transform into FM phase when B exceeds 2.1 T. At higher temperatures, such as at T = 40 K, the system retains a stripe domain phase at lower magnetic field strengths, but it transforms directly into FM order instead of forming skyrmions when the magnetic field is further increased to 1.5 T. This implies that the critical temperature for the skyrmion lattice phase is below 40 K. As the temperature increased further (T > 60 K), the system exhibited a disordered phase due to strong thermal fluctuations. Therefore, the topological phase transition of 2D T-CdCr
2
Te
4
can be achieved by modulating the external magnetic field and temperature, thereby generating and annihilating skyrmions. Furthermore, the top Cr layer in the FE2 state always maintains an FM state, while the magnetic behavior of the bottom Cr layer is similar to the top Cr layer in the FE1 state in terms of temperature and magnetic field effects, with the critical temperature of magnetic skyrmions of around 40 K (Supplementary Fig.
11
).

Among the considered systems, there are seven type-

multiferroic materials, including four T-AM

(CrMo
2
Se

, MnMo

Se
4
). In contrast to the type-
a
multiferroics, the intercalated species in the type-
b
multiferroics are transition metal atoms (Cr, Co, and Mn) with partially filled
d
orbitals, which are mainly responsible for the magnetism. The pristine MX
2
(M = Sc, Y, Zr, Mo; X = S, Se) bilayers are non-magnetic, and the intercalation of A (A = Cr, Co, and Mn) atoms causes a transition from non-magnetic to magnetic state in the system.
The preferred magnetic order was determined by comparing the energy of different magnetic configurations (Supplementary Table
4
), and three parameters for magnetic exchange interactions (
J
1
,
J
2
, and
J
3
) are sufficient to describe the magnetic interactions as the magnetism is provided by the intercalated A atom within one layer. Take T-CoZr
2
S
4
for example, its magnetic ground state is FM with the first nearest neighbor magnetic coupling coefficient
J
1
> 0. This can be explained by the GKA rules and is approximately 20 times larger than that of
J
2
and
J
3
, dominating the magnetic interaction between the Co atoms. Meanwhile, the magnetization of T-CoZr
2
S
4
prefers the out-of-plane direction with an MAE of 0.61 meV/Co, and the Curie temperature from MC simulation is about 70 K, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
10j
. Simultaneously, T-CoZr
2
S
4
remains in a FE state at 300 K without significant structural deformation (Supplementary Fig.
9c
), indicating that it is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, and the FE transition temperature is higher than room temperature. Combined with the FM transition temperature, it is inferred that T-CoZr
2
S
4
has room temperature stability and maintains multiferroic of coexisting ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism below 60 K. Moreover, T-CoZr
2
Se
4
also has FM magnetic ground state, whereas T-CoSc

favor AFM order, and T-CoY
2
S
4
has the highest Néel temperature of 50 K (Table
2
). Except for H-MnMo
2
Se
4
, the majority of type-
b
multiferroics prefer the out-of-plane direction as the easy magnetization axis, and T-CoY
2
S
4
has a maximum MAE of 0.92 meV/Co.
The magnetic behavior (magnetic ground state and the direction of the easy magnetization axis) during the FE polarization reversal process was examined to investigate the ME coupling phenomena of T-CoZr
2
S
4
(Fig.
6
). T-CoZr
2
S
4
maintains the ground state of FM during the initial phase of polarization reversal because the energies of FM are lower than those of AFM states. Nevertheless, the energies of AFM states decrease as get closer to the PE phase, turning the magnetic ground state into an AFM state. Subsequently, the magnetic ground state reverts to the FM state as the energy difference between the AFM and FM states increases. Interestingly, T-CoZr
2
S
4
favors in-plane MAE with a greater value of −13.34 meV/Co in the PE phase, but in other states of the polarization reversal process, it adopts an out-of-plane easy magnetization axis. The magnetic ground state and MAE values for the other type-
b
multiferroics are also summarized in Supplementary Table
5
. During the process of polarization reversal, T-CoY
2
S
4
and H-MnMo
2
S
4
exhibit a similar ME coupling phenomenon as T-CoZr
2

and T-CoSc

solely change the magnetic ground state, and H-MnMo

only shows changes in MAE (Supplementary Fig.

In type-
c
multiferroics, pristine TiX
2
(X = Se/Te) bilayers are non-magnetic semiconductors, and the intercalation of magnetic Co atoms produces two stable multiferroic materials with lower barriers, namely, T-CoTi
2
Se
4
and T-CoTi
2
Te
4
. In addition to the intercalated Co atoms with intrinsic magnetic moment, induced magnetic moments also exist on the Ti atoms. The special coordination between the intercalated Co atoms and the Te atoms results in distinct magnetic moments between the top (Ti
top
) and bottom (Ti
bot
) layers of Ti. Therefore, one has to consider possible FiM configurations. The magnetic configurations and corresponding energies of FM, AFM, and FiM states for type-
c
multiferroics are presented in Supplementary Fig.
7c
and Supplementary Table
6
. Both T-CoTi

exhibit FiM ground states with total net magnetic moment of 0.24

Using T-CoTi
2
Te
4
as a representative, we have investigated the possible ME coupling phenomena in type-
c
multiferroic material. The band structures of FE1 and FE2 states exhibit metallic properties (Fig.
7a, b
), but at the Fermi level, conduction electrons in the FE1 state are mainly contributed by spin-down electrons, while those in the FE2 state are predominantly dominated by spin-up channel, as illustrated in Fig.
7c, d
. Furthermore, Ti
top
and Ti
bot
possess magnetic moments of 0.62
µ
B
and 0.82
µ
B
in the FE1 state, whereas these values become 0.82
µ
B
and 0.62
µ
B
in the FE2 state, indicating that reversing polarization direction may affect the spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons. The more intuitive spin-polarized charge distribution diagrams can be found in Supplementary Fig.
13
, which further demonstrates the influence of polarization on the spin-charge distribution. The CoTi
2
Te

maintains a FiM order as its magnetic ground state in both FE1 and FE2 phases, but its easy magnetization axis changes from
x
-direction to
z
-direction after polarization reversal, further confirming the characteristics of ME coupling.

To summarize, we performed high-throughput first-principles calculations to filter potential 2D multiferroics induced by intercalated ions displacement among TMD intercalation compounds. By intercalating transition metal ions into the tetragonal-like vacancies of MX
2
bilayers, we obtained 960 candidate 2D AM
2
X
4
structures and identified 40 systems possessing high structural stability, large FE polarization, low FE switching barrier, and high transition temperature. We carefully discussed the intrinsic stabilization mechanism of polarization in four FE semiconductors and 31 FE metals/half-metals, and the out-plane polarization vary from 0.26 pC/m to 15.22 pC/m, comparable to those in typical 2D FE materials. Among the selected 40 FE intercalation compounds, there are 21 materials exhibit ferroelectricity and magnetism simultaneously. According to the origin of magnetism, we divided them into twelve type-
a
, seven type-
b
, and two type-
c
multiferroic materials, which exhibit different ME coupling behavior. In type-
a
multiferroic T-CdCr
2
Te
4
, the magnetism mainly arises from the CrTe
2
bilayer, and skyrmion conversion between its top and bottom layers can be achieved through polarization switching. In type-
b
multiferroic T-CoZr
2
S
4
, the unfilled
d
orbitals of the intercalated Co atoms contribute to the magnetic moment. During the FE switching process, the magnetic ground state undergoes a transition from FM to AFM to FM, and the easy magnetization axis switches between out-of-plane and in-plane directions. The intercalated Co atoms can introduce magnetism into the non-magnetic TiSe
2
/TiTe
2
bilayers, forming type-
c
multiferroics. In type-
c
multiferroic T-CoTi
2
Te
4
, both the spin-polarized charge spatial distribution and MAE change during polarization reversal. All these findings significantly expand the family of 2D ferroic materials and open a pathway for the development and implementation of nonvolatile logic and memory devices.
Methods
Electron density distribution
The conduction electron density
\({\rho }_{c}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})\)
is defined as the charge density within 0.05 eV near the Fermi level, and the conduction electron density distribution along
z
-direction was obtained by integrating
\({\rho }_{c}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})\)
within the
xy
plane:
$${\rho }_{c}({\rm{z}})=\iint {\rho }_{c}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})\,{dxdy}$$
(3)
The existence of center inversion symmetry in the paraelectric (PE) state ensures zero polarization, so the net polarization electron density
\({\rho }_{P}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})\)
is defined as the difference in charge density between the FE phase and the PE phase:
$${\rho }_{P}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})={\rho }_{{FE}}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})-{\rho }_{{PE}}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})$$
(4)
where
\({\rho }_{{FE}}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})\)
and
\({\rho }_{{PE}}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})\)
are the total electron density of the FE phase and the PE phase, respectively. Similar to the conduction electron density, we also integrate the polarization charges within the
xy
plane to obtain the distribution of the polarization electron density along the
z
-direction:
$${\rho }_{P}({\text{z}})=\iint [{\rho }_{{FE}}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})-{\rho }_{{PE}}(\vec{{\bf{r}}})]{dxd}y$$
(5)
Computational details
All calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
46
. The ion-electron interactions were described using the projector-augmented plane wave (PAW) approach
47
, and the electron exchange-correlation interactions were described within the generalized gradient approximation parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)
48
. The planewave basis was expanded to 500 eV, with a convergence threshold of 10
−
7
eV in energy and 10
−3
eV/Å in force, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with the Γ-centered Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid
49
, with uniform spacing of 2π*0.02 Å
−1
. A vacuum space of more than 15 Å in
z
direction was added to avoid interactions between neighboring layers. The dynamic stability of all structures was assessed by their phonon dispersions, which were computed with the finite displacement method implemented in the Phonopy code
50
. The thermodynamic stability was evaluated by the formation energy, which is defined as

formula. The FE energy transition barrier was evaluated using the climbing-image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method
51
. The out-of-plane polarization was calculated considering the dipole correction
52
and the in-plane polarization was estimated using the Berry phase method
53
. To account for the strong correlation effects involving localized
d
electrons, the effective Hubbard parameters

were applied to all 3
d
and 4

transition metal elements, where
U
is the Coulomb repulsion, and

is the exchange parameter
54
,
55
,
56
. The
U
eff
values used in this work are summarized in Supplementary Table
1
. The Curie or Néel temperature was evaluated using the Monte Carlo (MC) method
57
with an 80 × 80 lattice. The FE switching temperatures were estimated by the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations within the
NVT
ensemble, which were performed on a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell for at least 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs
58
.
Micromagnetic simulations
As for the topological magnetism, we performed MC simulations for the CdCr
2
Te
4
monolayer under different temperatures and magnetic fields to simulate the evolution of the spin textures using the Metropolis algorithm-based
Spirit
software
59
. The MC simulation considers periodic boundary conditions and operates in an 80 × 80 supercell containing 115,200 spin sites with a minimum MC step size of 6 × 10
5
, and the initial magnetic moments were set to random configurations.

Computational Progress of High Entropy Materials
Submission status
Open
Submission deadline
07 October 2024
High entropy materials (HEMs) are distinct for their varied compositions involving multiple elements in nearly equal amounts, unlike conventional materials that typically rely on one or two main elements with smaller additives. They cover a wide spectrum of materials, including high entropy alloys (HEAs), ceramics (HECs), and oxides (HEOs), offering customizable properties—a thrilling arena in materials science.
Computational methods play a vital role in the study of HEMs because of their vast composition space and intricate atomic interactions. They are instrumental in predicting properties, minimizing the need for trial-and-error experiments, and providing insights into their stability and transformation processes. Recent advancements in computational techniques, such as machine learning and multi-scale modeling, have transformed the field of HEMs research. These approaches enable the prediction of novel structures, simulation of atomic behavior, and integration of experimental data with computational analysis, leading to a deeper understanding of HEMs.
We invite submission of papers focusing on the computational advancements of high entropy materials. All submitted papers will be subjected to a rigorous peer-review process and adhere to the same editorial standards as regular npj Computational Materials articles. The Guest Editors overseeing the submissions declare no competing interests and will maintain impartiality throughout the peer-review process.

Transport Mechanisms in Energy Materials
Submission status
Open
Submission deadline
31 October 2024
Energy serves as a fundamental pillar for both economic and social development. The advancement of cutting-edge energy materials stands as a crucial cornerstone in driving the transition towards a new energy-driven economy. Despite the progressive enhancement of material performance, significant barriers persist in the efficiency of energy conversion and storage, thereby constraining the broader adoption of new energy technologies across various sectors. One critical bottleneck pertains to the transport of electrons and ions, playing a pivotal role in hampering the efficacy of energy conversion and storage. This limitation is notably evident in areas such as electric and thermal transport within thermoelectric materials, ion and electron conveyance in lithium battery materials, and charge transfer in optoelectronic materials. Unveiling the transport mechanisms within energy materials stands as the bedrock upon which we can bolster transport efficiency and devise novel energy materials.
The integration of computational material methods, artificial intelligence technology, and advanced in-situ experimental characterization techniques constitutes a foundational approach for unraveling the microstructural transport mechanisms within energy materials. The recent surge in mechanism elucidation, powered by these integrated methodologies, is widely acknowledged as a pivotal avenue for material innovations, consequently propelling advancements in new energy applications. This collection is dedicated to tracking the latest developments and publishing intriguing investigations pertaining to transport mechanisms within energy materials.
The topic will include, but are not limited to:
Thermal and electron transportation mechanisms in Thermoelectric materials
Charge transfer mechanisms in optoelectrical materials
Li-ion and electron transportation mechanisms in electrode materials
Novel materials and designs for energy-related applications.
Multiscale computational material methods for energy applications.

Machine Learning of Defects in Crystals
Submission status
Open
Submission deadline
21 October 2024
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the properties of condensed matter. To date, most research has focused on the bulk properties of solids, however, defects are ubiquitous in crystalline systems. Many modern functional technologies are constrained or enabled by their presence. For example, in photovoltaics, point-defects can introduce electronic states that fall within the band gap and result in voltage losses through trapping and non-radiative recombination. In contrast, point-defect qubits are an emerging platform for quantum computing and sensing that are uniquely enabled by long lived and addressable spin states on paramagnetic point defects. Defects pose a particular challenge for modern machine learning methods since they are often charged, leading to long range forces that are not well captured by existing approaches. This collection focuses on the development and application of novel machine learning approaches to study the geometric, thermodynamic, kinetic, and electronic properties of defects in the solid state.

Journal Metrics
DORA: The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment
Springer Nature is a
signatory
of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Because small numbers of highly cited articles can have outsized influence on certain citation measures like the 2-year Journal Impact Factor (JIF) (see below for definition), Springer Nature believes that these citation measures are not necessarily measures of journal quality, and that authors and readers should consider a range of metrics when evaluating journals to read and publish in.
Article metrics such as number of downloads, citations and online attention are available from each article page, and provide an overview of the attention received by a paper.
Citation Impact 2023
Journal Impact Factor: 9.4
5-year Journal Impact Factor: 11.5
Immediacy Index: 2.5
Eigenfactor® Score: 0.02176
Article Influence Score: 3.1
Speed 2023
Submission to first editorial decision (median days): 11
Submission to acceptance (median days): 181
Usage 2023
Downloads: 1,990,379
Altmetric mentions: 1,676
Definitions
The metric definitions below are shared by all Springer Nature journals.
Citation Impact
Journal Impact Factor
The Journal Impact Factor is defined as all citations to the journal in the current JCR year to items published in the previous two years, divided by the total number of scholarly items (these comprise articles, reviews, and proceedings papers) published in the journal in the previous two years. Though not a strict mathematical average, the Journal Impact Factor provides a functional approximation of the mean citation rate per citable item. A Journal Impact Factor of 1.0 means that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited one time. A Journal Impact Factor of 2.5 means that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited two and a half times. The citing works may be articles published in the same journal. However, most citing works are from different journals, proceedings, or books indexed in Web of Science Core Collection. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
5-year Journal Impact Factor
The 5-year journal Impact Factor, available from 2007 onward, is the average number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year. It is calculated by dividing the number of citations in the JCR year by the total number of articles published in the five previous years. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Immediacy Index
The Immediacy Index is the average number of times an article is cited in the year it is published. The journal Immediacy Index indicates how quickly articles in a journal are cited. The aggregate Immediacy Index indicates how quickly articles in a subject category are cited. The Immediacy Index is calculated by dividing the number of citations to articles published in a given year by the number of articles published in that year. Because it is a per-article average, the Immediacy Index tends to discount the advantage of large journals over small ones. However, frequently issued journals may have an advantage because an article published early in the year has a better chance of being cited than one published later in the year. Many publications that publish infrequently or late in the year have low Immediacy Indexes. For comparing journals specializing in cutting-edge research, the immediacy index can provide a useful perspective. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Eigenfactor® Score
The Eigenfactor Score calculation is based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year, but it also considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals. References from one article in a journal to another article from the same journal are removed, so that Eigenfactor Scores are not influenced by journal self-citation. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Article Influence Score
The Article Influence Score determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication. It is calculated by multiplying the Eigenfactor Score by 0.01 and dividing by the number of articles in the journal, normalized as a fraction of all articles in all publications. This measure is roughly analogous to the 5-Year Journal Impact Factor in that it is a ratio of a journal’s citation influence to the size of the journal’s article contribution over a period of five years. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Speed
Submission to first editorial decision
This measures the median time in days from when the journal receives a manuscript submission to when the submission is either sent out for peer review or rejected.
Submission to acceptance
This measures the median time in days from when the journal receives a manuscript submission to when the submission is accepted. This includes all peer review and can also include time in revision.
Usage
Downloads
Downloads reflect the number of times full text or PDF versions of articles are accessed directly from the journal website and Springer Link. Downloads are defined as HTML, LookInside, PDF, and Epub clicks. Please note that this does not include article downloads from mirror databases such as PubMed Central. These download counts comply with the COUNTER5 standard. COUNTER5 is the fifth iteration of the “Code of Practice,” from
Counter Metrics
, which is a not-for-profit organization financially sustained by its global community of members, including libraries, consortia, publishers, aggregators, and technology providers.
Altmetric mentions
Total number of mentions (e.g. X, Facebook, Reddit, Blogs, News articles, Policy documents, and Faculty of 1000 reviews) for articles published in the specified timeframe, as provided by
Altmetric
.

npj Series
Community-focused. Researcher-edited. Broad Reach. The npj journals are a unique partnership between the Nature Portfolio and a range of discipline communities, bringing researchers the best combination of community focus and high-quality editing. The npjs cover disciplines from the physical and applied sciences; to the life and health sciences; society & environment; and beyond. Every npj journal is the result of close collaboration with the community it serves.
Defining journal features
Researchers from the field lead each npj journal
This editorial collaboration combines close knowledge of a field’s current state of research with the Nature Portfolio’s quality and standards that researchers trust.
More accessible venue in the Nature Portfolio
Being a more discipline-specific portfolio, the npjs aim to cultivate a broad range of well-conducted research with a less selective acceptance criterion. The npjs send over 45% of manuscripts we receive out to review so you can benefit from the feedback to improve your paper.
Wide-reaching visibility for your work
Springer Nature’s fully open access journals earn more
downloads
, citations, and exposure. Including up to 5x more downloads, and 7.39 citations per article on average. As journals specifically focused on their discipline communities, the npjs work to bring important research to those communities, without barriers and with this elevated exposure and impact. As science moves, the npj portfolio continues to expand in response to the communities’ needs for new venues for important research areas.
Partnership drives our ethos
The npj series was originally conceived of as Nature
Partner
Journals, and that word —
partner
— drives our ethos. Partnership and collaboration are at the core of the npjs’ approach to authors, editors, reviewers, institutions, the wider Springer Nature journal family, and partners around the world to help ensure a global, diverse perspective, while also regional research progress.

Abstract
All-solid-state Na-ion batteries have emerged as alternatives to all-solid-state Li-ion batteries owing to the global abundance of Na element. However, finding a commercially viable Na-ion solid-state electrolyte (SSE) remains challenging due to the relatively poor understanding of the structures effective for conduction compared to those for Li-ion SSE. In this study, we develop a screening framework based on an unsupervised machine learning technique to characterize Na-ion SSEs according to their lattice structures. Specifically, we evaluate feature vectors encoding 180 structural properties for 12,670 materials containing Na ions. Subsequently, the resulting feature vectors are clustered using hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN), leading to the discovery of 12 groups including those with experimentally proven Na-ion superionic conductors such as NASICONs and sodium chalcogenides.
Post hoc
analysis of these clusters reveals that the groups with high conductivity share similar characteristics, including the existence of ion channels for Na ions and the weak interactions between Na ions and the proximate atoms. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the promising groups exhibit exceptional ion diffusivity compared to other groups. By employing decision tree classifiers trained to screen promising groups, we demonstrate the rapid assessment of the potential of a given material. Finally, we offer perspectives and insights for the development of novel Na-ion SSEs for all-solid-state Na-ion batteries.

Introduction
The constant demand for secure energy storage solutions continues to drive advancements in all-solid-state batteries. Thus far, the development strategy has primarily focused on the exploration of Li-ion solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). With many reported as superionic conductors, the efforts have greatly contributed to advancing our understanding of Li-ion SSEs
1
. However, concerns about the stable supply of lithium, which is a geographically limited resource, triggered the pressing need to explore and develop a commercially viable Na-ion-based SSE
1
,
2
. However, Na-ion-based SSEs suffer from a critical drawback of low ionic conductivity at room temperature, which has impeded their development and commercialization.
To address this challenge, numerous research efforts have successfully identified Na-ion solid-state electrolytes with viable ionic conductivities, including sodium superionic conductors (NASICONs)

(e.g., Na

), it is widely recognized that the ionic conductivity of SSEs can be significantly improved by introducing defects to their structures
1
. It suggests that the defects enable mobile ions to migrate to the adjacent vacant site, by lowering the activation energy required to pass through bottleneck facets. To this end, various optimization strategies have been devised to find effective structures and compositions that can facilitate sodium ion migration, as summarized in the review of Wu et al.

Discovering such highly conductive sodium-ion conductors remains a challenge, and the key descriptors of the underlying mechanism have not yet been uncovered. One of the common approaches for predicting ionic conductivity is to find an explicit correlation between conductivity and key descriptors such as the channel size of mobility ion and the coordination number. While these approaches may increase the analytic understanding of high conductivity, they run the risk of overlooking superionic conductors that cannot be identified by the descriptors selected
17
,
18
. To resolve this problem, machine learning (ML) techniques can be exploited. These techniques can identify key descriptors through data learning

. However, care must be taken when applying machine learning techniques for material discovery, as the models can easily be overfitted when insufficient data is given, and this will lead to unreliable results. Our comprehensive literature survey reveals that, to date, only 34 Na-ion SSEs have experimental records of ionic conductivity. Hence, the use of supervised learning techniques for modeling Na-ion SSEs, such as random forest regression
2
, cannot be free from the risk of model overfitting.
When only data is limited, unsupervised learning techniques can be utilized. Zhang et al. employed an unsupervised clustering approach with modified X-ray diffraction (mXRD) data and successfully identified promising candidates for Li-based SSEs
30
. They discovered 16 potential Li-ion SSEs whose ionic conductivities ranged from 10
−4
to 10
−1
S cm
−1
under ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation environment. Another notable approach used for discovering potential SSE is the semi-supervised learning technique proposed by Laskowski et al.
29
. They employed agglomerative clustering with 1346 ionic conductivity data for Li-ion SSEs and succeeded in identifying Li
3

3
as a promising candidate. By doping it with silicon (Li
2.95

S

), they achieved a room temperature conductivity of 1.07
\(\times\)
10
−3
S cm
−
1
. They also identified smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) as the key descriptor for ionic conductivity among the 20 structural descriptors they used. However, no detailed explanation was provided regarding the relationship between SOAP and conductivity. Furthermore, such a univariate analysis carries the risk of a biased conclusion if ionic conductivity is governed by multiple factors rather than a single descriptor.
To address the problem with scarce data and elicit key descriptors for ionic conductivity, we propose a novel Na-ion SSE screening framework based on unsupervised clustering and
a posteriori
multivariate analysis (Fig.
1
). We first transform available Na-containing materials into feature vectors by encoding their structural information with multiple descriptors (Fig.
1a–c
). The materials in the feature space are then clustered based on their structural similarity. By overlaying available ionic conductivity data for Na-ion SSEs, we identify promising groups and screen potential candidates whose conductivity data are currently unavailable (Fig.
1d
). By running AIMD simulations over the screened candidates, we further confirm the promising groups discovered and narrow down the potential candidates. By employing decision tree analysis, key descriptors, and their criteria are uncovered in the order of their importance. The descriptors used in this study are listed in Table
1
, with detailed explanations for each descriptor available in the references. Note that these descriptors are not known to be correlated with ionic conductivity, and the objective of this study is to discover such correlations through
a posteriori
data analysis.

The contribution of this work is twofold. Firstly, promising groups and candidate materials are screened that can be further investigated for potential Na-ion superionic conductors. Secondly, classification models are provided that can evaluate the potential of unknown materials solely based on their lattice structures. This evaluation process does not require energy above the convex hull and band gap energy values that entail costly DFT computations, allowing rapid assessment of candidate materials. The model also supports measuring the novelty of queried material, thus serving as a guide for discovering novel superionic all-solid-state conductors.
Results and discussion
General description of clustering results
Using HDBSCAN, the Na-ion conductors are categorized into 13 groups: two large groups, namely Groups 5 and 7, along with smaller groups (Fig.
2a
). An additional group is arranged to incorporate the materials classified as noises in HDBSCAN. The large groups (Groups 5 and 7) are further clustered into smaller subgroups and labeled by Group 5A–5C and Group 7A–7V (Fig.
2b
and Supplementary Fig.
2
). Materials representing each group are provided in Table
2
. The experimentally reported Na-ion SSEs are classified into a few subgroups, namely Group 5A, 7B, 7H, 7L, 7S, 7U, and 7V. The detailed information is presented in Supplementary Table
3
and Supplementary Table
4
. Note that some substances, such as Na

The energy above the convex hull (
\({E}_{{\rm{hull}}}\)
), an indicator of a material’s thermodynamic stability, is another crucial indicator to find potential Na-ion SSEs as feasible SSEs typically show metastability. The known SSEs with high ionic conductivity typically have
\({E}_{{\rm{hull}}}\)
lower than 70 meV
32
, but we relaxed the criterion to 100 meV to include possible superionic conductors while ensuring the metastability. Likewise, the materials whose band gaps are lower than 0.5 eV were filtered out prior to clustering, which reduces the possibility of including electrical conductors. The
\({E}_{{\rm{hull}}}\)
and
\({E}_{{\rm{gap}}}\)
distributions after filtering show distinctive patterns across the groups (Supplementary Figs.
1
and
2
). For instance, the materials in Groups 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 11 generally have high
\({E}_{{\rm{hull}}}\)
values, implying they are intrinsically unstable and hardly SSEs.
Group 1 predominantly comprises sodium salts (e.g., Na
2
S, Na
2
O, NaCl, and NaI). None of the materials within Group 1 exhibit high ionic conductivity (>10

). A few sodium-containing anti-perovskites Na
3
OX and Na
4
OX

(X = Cl, Br, and I) are also classified as Group 1. In contrast, sodium salts that contain covalent bonds (e.g., NaOH, Na
2
SO
4
, and Na
3
PO
4
) are classified as Group 7O–7R (Supplementary Table
5
). The materials comprising these groups predominantly contain oxygens (>40%) with variations in composition. Groups 2–5 and 9–12 contain materials with composite structures consisting of tetrahedral oxides XO
4
(X = Si, P, and S) and transition metal oxides (MO
n
where
n
= 4, 6). Group 8 is comprised of materials with CO
3
2
−
anions and transition metals. To our knowledge, the ion conductivities of these materials have not yet been reported.
Sodium hydrides and halides are classified as Group 7B and 7S, respectively. In Group 7B, NaBX
4
, NaAlX
4
, and Na
3
AlX
6
(X = H or F) are found, which are analogous to lithium hydrides such as Li
2
NH, LiBH
4
, LiAlH
4
, and LiNH
2
that have been studied as promising Li-ion solid-state conductors
17
. Group 7S contains sodium halides except those with cubic structures. This group includes Na

(3.5

). The subgroups containing sodium halides are also found: Group 7C for Cl, Br, I, and Group 7D for F. The major difference between these two subgroup sets lies in their lattice structures. Most of the materials in Group 7C and 7D have cubic (Fm3̅m) structures, with many forming double perovskite structures, while those in Group 7B and 7S have non-cubic structures. These materials have not been extensively studied yet, and their ionic conductivities remain unknown. For other groups whose ionic conductivity data are not available, namely Groups 2, 3, 4, 7A, 7E, 7F, 7G, 7I, 7J, 7K, 7M, 7N, 7O, 7P, 7Q, 7R, and 8–12, it is difficult to find out further prominent features based on human knowledge. Furthermore, those groups contain possibly unstable materials due to the presence of redox-active elements (e.g., Na
15
Cr

and Na4CoO4 in Group 3; Na

in Group 10). Therefore, these groups were excluded from candidate screening.
Exploration of promising groups of Na-ion solid-state conductors
Highly conductive Na-ion SSEs are predominantly found in Groups 5A, 5B, 7H, 7L, 7U, and 7V among the 36 groups clustered. For simplification, the groups showing large similarities are hereafter collectively referred to using the following abbreviations: Group 7UV, Group 7HL, and Group 5AB.
It is observed that sodium chalcogenides, which are highly conductive Na-ion SSEs, are predominantly found in Group 7UV, highlighting their potential as promising candidates. Particularly noteworthy is the family of sodium thiophosphate with space group I4̅3m (Na

), which exhibit the highest conductivity among the Na-ion conductors, are situated precisely on the boundary between Group 7U and 7V in the feature space (Fig.
2b
). Many well-known materials in these subgroups have demonstrated remarkable ionic conductivities at room temperature. For example, Na

, respectively. One notable characteristic of these groups is their relatively high Na atomic fraction, along with a substantial presence of chalcogens (S, Se, and Te; Group 7U) and pnictogens (P, As, Sb, and Bi; Group 7V) (Fig.
2c
and Supplementary Fig.
3
). Some of chalcogenides, especially NaMX
2
with trigonal (R3̅m) or tetragonal (I41/amd) structures (e.g., NaHoS
2
and NaBiSe
2
), are clustered into a different subgroup (Group 7T). None of the substances belonging to this group is known for measured ionic conductivity.
Group 7HL is comprised of compounds containing Na
+
in conjunction with boranes or carboranes. Several promising solid-state conductors within these subgroups, such as NaCB

H

, Na
2
B
12
H
12
43
, share a common characteristic: they exhibit exceptional high conductivity at elevated temperatures but experience a sharp decline below a critical temperature, leading to very low conductivity at room temperature (Fig.
2d
). Apart from these, a significant portion of the group comprises boron oxides, such as Na
3
B
7
O
12
.
NASICON-like compounds, which are recognized for their outstanding conductivity, are mostly found in Group 5. Among them, substances that can form various lattice structures (e.g., Na
3
Zr
2
Si
2
PO
12
44
, Na

3
45
, and Na

Hf
2
Si

) are clustered into two subgroups. Materials with lower stability (
E
hull
\(> 5\times {10}^{-3}\)
eV/atom) are predominantly found in Group 5B, while the remainder is classified into Group 5A (Fig.
2b
). Although Group 5C shares many similarities with Groups 5A and 5B, it is distinguished by its low Na fraction (4.5%).
Materials with high ionic conductivity records (>10
−
2
S cm
−1
) are primarily discovered in Group 5AB, with additional occurrences in Group 7HL and Group 7UV. Therefore, these three groups hold significant potential for including materials with high ionic conductivity. However, a large fraction of Group 7HL are boron oxides, while known borane-based superionic conductors typically do not contain oxygen. Consequently, it is relatively unlikely to find promising candidates in Group 7HL. In contrast, Group 7UV consists of materials with relatively simple compositions (Table
2
), many of which have been extensively studied. Therefore, it is more advantageous to perform thorough candidate screening within Group 7UV over the other four promising groups.
To confirm this conjecture, we applied a shortcut screening method
17
that sequentially drops out the materials with low potential across 100 candidate materials. These candidates were randomly sampled from each subgroup of Group 7. The potential of each candidate was assessed based on the MSD values obtained during AIMD simulation from high (1000 K) to low (800 K) temperature. The selection method is outlined in the Method section. Materials within Group 7U exhibit significantly larger MSD values compared to those in other groups, indicating a high potential for conductivity (Fig.
3a
). The highest MSD value is observed in Na
3
BP

within Group 7V, whereas the remaining materials in Group 7V show a distribution pattern similar to that of Group Others. Notably, a considerable number of materials within Group 7B show elevated MSD values compared to those in other subgroups.

The AIMD simulation results conducted at a lower temperature narrow down the potential candidates for further inspection. A few candidates in Group 7UV maintain high MSD values, while those in other subgroups, including Group 7B, exhibit drastically decreased MSD. These findings strongly suggest that Group 7UV is a promising group for discovering effective materials. The extended simulations conducted on promising candidates demonstrate the effectiveness of the shortcut screening method (Fig.
3
c, d). The trends of the MSD slopes within the short timespan (10 ps for 1000 K; 30 ps for 800 K) were found to be consistent with those obtained from longer simulations (30 ps for 1000 K; 80 ps for 800 K). During the AIMD simulations of the promising materials, the ion hopping phenomenon was observed not only in known superionic conductors (e.g., Na
3

in Fig.

) but also in compounds whose conductivities are unknown (e.g., Na

in Fig.

).
Identification of the key descriptors for characterizing groups with high ionic conductivity
To identify the key descriptors for high ionic conductivity, decision tree analysis was performed on the feature vector data, consisting of 9811 feature values for 7256 materials. Decision tree analysis is a supervised learning algorithm that employs repeated binary splits to classify the target label data by minimizing impurity with the fewest splits. As a result, the key descriptor and their threshold values are identified in decreasing order of the Gini importance from the tree’s root to the leaves. We employed decision tree analysis for the two promising groups discovered in this study, namely Group 5AB and 7UV (Fig.
4
). A visual representation of the feature vector data can be found in Supplementary Figure
6
, and a detailed description for decision tree analysis is provided in “Method” section.
Fig. 4: Decision tree analysis results.

From the root node (node 0) the materials in the database are divided into binary nodes (nodes 1 and 2) by the first key descriptor. The second key descriptor further splits the resulting subset into two nodes (nodes 3 and 4). The majority of materials in Group 5AB have been classified by two descriptors: mXRD-A40 #121 and the JCFID-CAMN40 #963.
b
Likewise, those in Group 7UV have been characterized by two descriptors: Meredig #110 and OFM-CAMN40 #78.

Horizontal bars indicate the fraction of the materials classified, where the colors indicate the corresponding leaf node in the decision tree. Promising groups (Group 5AB and Group 7UV) are characterized by high purity using only two descriptors.
Full size image
The first descriptor for Group 5AB is mXRD-A40 #121, with a criterion of >0.06 and an importance score of 0.32 (Table
3
). The descriptor reflects the mXRD peak intensity near 2
\({\rm{\theta }}\)
= 33°–36° range, indicating a high content of tetrahedral structure XO
4
(X = Si, P, and S) within the lattice (Supplementary Note
1
). Groups 2–6 and 9–12 show particularly high peak intensities compared to other groups. These groups also have a high oxygen content (>30%) along with moderate Si/P/S content (>10%), suggesting that the identified descriptor is characteristic feature for NASICONs (Supplementary Fig.
3
). The second descriptor for Group 5AB is JarvisCFID-CAMN40 #963, with a criterion of <289 and an importance score of 0.53. This descriptor is a part of the angular distribution function. The need for a second descriptor for high-purity classification implies that this angular distribution function discriminates NASICONs from other XO
4
-abundant materials.

Full size table
The first key descriptor identified for Group 7UV is Meredig #110, with a criterion of <1.82 and an importance score of 0.61. The materials composed of elements with high electronegativity, such as F, O, N, and Cl, do not meet the criteria to be classified as Group 7UV. As a result, this descriptor distinguishes the chalcogenides from the materials containing F, O, N, and Cl. It suggests that, despite the presence of wide Na-ion channels in the lattice structure, which are commonly observed in NASICONs, highly negatively charged atoms (e.g., oxygen) could hinder the movement of Na-ions within the channels, consequently leading to low ionic conductivity. Hence, this descriptor can also be interpreted as the maximum difference in electronegativities of the atoms in the lattice (Fig.
4b
). The second descriptor, OFM-CAMN40 #78, with a criterion of >0 and an importance score of 0.22. This descriptor encodes the average distance between Na ions and the neighboring atoms. This descriptor mostly excludes the materials within Group 1 (e.g., Na
2
S) and 7T, particularly those with trigonal (R3̅m) or tetragonal (I4
1
/amd) space groups (e.g., NaBiS
2
, Supplementary Fig.
9
and Supplementary Note
2
). It should be noted that in the AIMD simulations of NaBiS
2
, the hopping of Na ions is hindered due to its dense lattice structure, leading to low conductivity at 1000 K (Supplementary Fig.
4
). This suggests that the size of the channel for Na ions in a lattice is crucial for high ionic conductivity. The key descriptors for rest groups are listed in Supplementary Table

Assessment of out-of-sample data using the framework
Applying the developed framework to a recently studied ionic conductor, which can be considered as out-of-sample data, can demonstrate how it can rapidly assess the potential of the given material. Figure

The trained HDBSCAN classifies this out-of-sample material as Group 5B, further confirming its potential to have high ionic conductivity as a NASICON. It is noteworthy that the feature vector evaluation procedure does not require
\({E}_{{\rm{hull}}}\)
and
\({E}_{{\rm{gap}}}\)
, which typically entails costly DFT computations. This underscores the effectiveness of the developed framework for rapid pre-screening of Na-based SSEs.

Perspectives on solid-state Na-ion superionic conductors
The findings from unsupervised screening provide invaluable insights into investigating solid-state Na-ion conductors. First, three promising groups have been found—Group 5AB (NASICONs), Group 7HL ((car)boranes), and Group 7UV (chalcogenides). Secondly, the clustering and subsequent
post hoc
analysis of these groups suggest that two necessary conditions must be satisfied for a material to exhibit superionic conductivity: the presence of specific elements/substructures, and the existence of channels for Na ions to flow through. For example, sodium chalcogenides lack highly electronegative elements, and the large distances between Na ions and neighboring atoms create spacious Na-ion channels. Remarkably, materials satisfying only the first condition (Group 7-T in Fig.
4c
) show low potential for high conductivity in the shortcut AIMD simulations (Supplementary Fig.
4
), supporting this hypothesis.
Discovering a solid-state Na-ion superionic conductor seems to be very challenging, given that only four out of 100 candidates are found to be promising in the shortcut AIMD simulations. A highly efficient screening approach should, therefore, be leveraged for exploring new solid-state Na-ion conductors. To this, the developed framework provides a systematic method in categorizing the queried material and prechecking its potential. For example, one can employ the decision tree classifier trained for Group 5AB for investigating materials composed of Na, M, Si, P, and O, to inspect the presence of a Na-ion channel within the lattice. Such a pre-screening process can effectively reduce the number of candidates for AIMD simulations for further investigation.
It is noteworthy that several promising solid-state Na-ion conductors, which are yet to be included in the Materials Project database, do exist. Specifically, numerous studies report the superionic conductivity of the materials that are derived from chalcogenides through doping or transitioning them into glass/glass-ceramic forms. For instance, the ionic conductivity of Na

do not undergo phase transitions and are recognized as the best-known solid-state Na-ion conductors at room temperature. It is important to mention that Na

is an anti-perovskite superionic conductor and is not currently included in the Materials Project. While other anti-perovskites Na

4
OX
2
(X = Br and I) are clustered as Group 1, Na
3
OBH
4
is more likely to be clustered into Group HL. This is because most boranes are found in Group 7B and 7HL, while those in Group 7B typically do not contain oxygen elements.
The developed framework can be extended to encompass not only solid-state Na-ion conductors but also those based on Li and K ions. Considering that solid-state Li-ion conductors have been more extensively studied than Na-ion conductors, a wealth of data is available in databases such as Materials Project (with over 20,000 entries). Hence, it is advantageous to conduct clustering and analyses over the entire database containing Li, Na, and K. In this context, it is worth mentioning that known Li-ion solid-state conductors share an analogy to the Na-ion conductors. For example, NASICONs are parallel to LISICONs (Lithium superionic conductors), which include materials of Li
4±x
Si
1-x
XO
4
(X = P, Al, and Ge)
51
. Additionally, sodium chalcogenides have their lithium sulfide counterparts, such as Li

7
P
3
S
11
53
, and Li
6
PS
5
Cl
54
. Similarly, sodium hydrides (e.g., NaBH
4
) correspond to lithium hydrides (e.g., LiBH
4
)
55
. Nevertheless, notable distinctions exist between the two, as exemplified by the fact that Li
3
N is a superionic conductor
56
, whereas Na
3
N is extremely unstable. Such disparity is further supported by the fact that the accepted classification method for Li-ion SSEs differs from that for Na-ion SSEs
57
. Hence, it would be intriguing to investigate how Li-ion SSEs and K-ion SSEs are clustered and to see if there is any intersection among the promising groups identified.
In this study, we have presented unsupervised clustering of potential solid-state Na-ion conductors and characterized the resulting groups with ML-based multivariate analysis. For this, we have constructed a multi-dimensional feature vector comprising the structural properties of SSEs. The clustering has identified 12 distinct groups and 25 subgroups. Based on the available ionic conductivity data, we have revealed that the materials with higher conductivities are concentrated within a few groups, suggesting a strong correlation between the structural features of the materials and their conductivity. Subsequent
post hoc
multivariate analyses of the clustered groups underpin that the environment surrounding the Na ions is closely linked to ionic conductivity. Specifically, we found that a set of descriptors, primarily mXRD, ADF, and MD, characterizes these groups and is presumed to play a key role in the ionic conductivity of solid-state Na-ion conductors. Furthermore, our ab initio molecular dynamics simulation results demonstrate that materials within the promising Na-ion SSE group exhibit relatively high diffusivities compared to those from other groups. The result suggests that the screened promising groups, namely 7U and 7V, can be prioritized for future discoveries of superionic solid-state Na-ion conductors. By leveraging the framework developed in this study, further research on previously unknown materials, including those with dopants, may lead to the discovery of exceptional Na-ion SSE superionic conductors. In this regard, generative models
58
can be employed in conjunction with the developed framework. It should also be noted that the effectiveness of the framework relies heavily on the amount of experimental data. Therefore, data augmentation based on recursive experimentation
59
can significantly improve the framework.
Methods
Data preparation
A dataset of 12,670 Na-containing materials is prepared from the Materials Project (MP, v.2022.10.28) using Pymatgen
25
(2023.5.10). For each material, nine structural representations are obtained using the simplification strategy developed by Laskowski et al.
29
. As illustrated in Fig.
1
, the original structure is simplified into CAMN structure where cations, anions, mobile ions, and neutral atoms are replaced with Al, S, Na, and Mg atoms, respectively. This CAMN structure excludes the dependency on chemical elements and compares solely the effects from structural characteristics. The atoms constituting CAMN structures are selectively eliminated by ion types and yield CAN, AM, and A structures, where the acronyms represent the ions retained. Four additional structures are obtained by transforming the simplified structures to be 40 Å
3
per the number of anions in the lattice, which yields CAMN40, CAN40, AM40, and A40 structures.
Twenty structural descriptors, which encode structural information, including spatial, chemical bonding, and electronic environments, are evaluated for each structural representation. Four additional descriptors, namely Na composition ratio (R), lattice volume (V), lattice type, and space group, are evaluated, thereby a total of 184 pairs of characteristic arrays are defined for each input material. The details of descriptors can be found in Table
1
. The resulting characteristic arrays are concatenated to a 1D-array feature vector with 9811 dimensions, and then the values are normalized to [0, 1] for each dimension. Invalid descriptors with any zero variances or infeasible values found over materials, namely Chemical ordering (CO), global instability index (GII), and structural heterogeneity (SH), are dropped. The descriptors used in this study are detailed in Supplementary Table
1
.
Clustering
The materials with unstable phases (
E
hull
\(>\)
0.1 eV/atom) and negligible band gap energy (
E
band gap
\(<\)
0.5 eV) are filtered out. The remaining 7,256 materials are then clustered by Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)
60
in the feature space. By creating a hierarchical representation of clusters, HDBSCAN identifies clusters with different shapes and sizes. During the clustering process, HDBSCAN aggregates small neighboring clusters based on their data density and classifies data points with lower membership strength as noises, making it robust to datasets with varying local densities. Prior to clustering, the feature vector dimensionality is reduced to 100 to facilitate HDBSCAN to accurately capture the data density. For dimensionality reduction, Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PACMAP)
61
is utilized, which is known to preserve global and local structures of the input data by dynamically controlling the distance between the pairwise points on the data manifold. Different hyperparameter setups are used for clustering groups and subgroups. The detailed information can be found in Supplementary Table
2
.
Candidate screening
The candidates for AIMD simulations are selected as follows. From the material in Group 7, those without unstable phases (
E
hull
\(>\)
0.05 eV/atom) and those including elements (C, N, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr) are excluded. Among them, five (thirty for Group 7U and 7 V) exploitative candidates and seven explorative candidates are chosen from each group. The exploitative candidates are designated to find highly conductive Na-ion SSEs, and they are chosen from materials in proximity to those with experimental records in the feature space. The explorative candidates are prepared for the analyses of group characteristics. To minimize the required number of candidates and alleviate the simulation workload, we opt to select the materials from relatively dense regions in the feature space, assuming that those ‘representative’ materials can effectively represent the surrounding materials. The detailed selection procedure is outlined below. First, the original data is transformed into a graph-structured uniform manifold using uniform manifold approximation
62
, which is to spread out the data within locally crowded spaces and prevent exhaustive sampling
63
,
64
. From the resulting graph, we select nodes (or material) with the highest closeness centrality
65
, which is a centrality measure based on a node’s connections to other nodes through short geodesics. For each node
\(i\)
, the closeness centrality is measured by
$$C\left(i\right)=\frac{N-1}{\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{j=1}^{N}{d}_{{ij}}}$$
(1)
where
\({d}_{{ij}}\)
is the distance between node
\(i\)
and its neighboring node
j
. The value of the parameter
\(N\)
is set to 15.
Identification of descriptors
Once promising groups are identified, the key descriptors, which describe the characteristics of these promising groups, are analyzed using decision tree classifiers in the scikit-learn package (v1.2.2). Decision tree classifiers utilize a tree-like data structure to make decisions or predictions. Starting from the root node, it recursively splits the dataset into two subsets over the descendent nodes by creating hierarchical if-else conditions to classify or predict outcomes
28
. On each node, the data are partitioned based on a variable and a binary criterion (e.g., mXRD > 0.5 for the left branch and mXRD
\(\le\)
0.5 for the right branch). The importance of a given variable
\(x\)
is calculated by the reduction in weighted node impurity. Specifically, the importance of a given variable
\(x\)
at node
\(k\)
is computed by
$${I}_{x}\left(k\right)=w\left(k\right)G\left(k\right)-{w}_{x+}\left(k\right){G}_{x+}\left(k\right)-{w}_{x-}\left(k\right){G}_{x-}\left(k\right)$$
(2)
where
\(w\left(k\right)\)
,
\({w}_{x+}\left(k\right)\)
and
\({w}_{x-}\left(k\right)\)
are the weighted number of samples reaching the node
\(k\)
and the two descendent nodes, and
\(G\left(k\right)\)
,
\({G}_{x+}\left(k\right)\)
, and
\({G}_{x-}\left(k\right)\)
are the Gini impurities of the node
\(k\)
and its two descendent nodes. The Gini impurity is defined as
\(G\left(k\right)=\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{i=1}^{C}{f}_{i}\left(1-{f}_{i}\right)\)
where
\(C\)
is the number of the classes of interest and
\(f\)
is the frequency of samples of class
\(i\)
. For each node
\(k\)
, the classifier selects the most discriminative variable, one that maximizes
\({I}_{x}\left(k\right)\)
.
The importance of a given variable
\(x\)
over a given tree can be quantified by
$$I\left(x\right)=\frac{\sum _{k}{\delta }_{x}\left(k\right){I}_{x}\left(k\right)}{\sum _{k\in K}{I}_{x}\left(k\right)}$$
(3)
where
\({{\rm{\delta }}}_{x}\left(k\right)=1\)
if node
\(k\)
is split by variable
\(x\)
, otherwise 0.
\(K\)
denotes the number of nodes in the tree. We utilize normalized importance to compare the importance among the variables of interest
\(X\)
.
$$I\left(x\right)=\frac{I\left(x\right)}{\sum _{x\in X}I\left(x\right)}$$

AIMD simulation
First-principles calculations were performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method
66
and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
67
, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)
68
. Ionic relaxation of simulation cells was conducted using a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 450 eV and a k-point density of at least 1000 per atom. The convergence criteria were set to 10
−5
eV for the electronic self-consistency loop and 0.03 eV/Å for the ionic relaxation loop. Na-ion diffusivity was assessed using AIMD simulations with an energy cutoff of 350 eV, a gamma point-only k-point grid, and the NVT ensemble with a Nose-Hoover thermostat. Supercells with all lattice constants over 10 Å were used for AIMD simulations. Mean squared displacement (MSD) was obtained at 800 K and 1000 K using a time step of 2 fs. MSD was measured after a heating step from 100 K to the target temperature at a heating rate of 1 K/fs, followed by an equilibration step of 2 ps. The criterion for long-range Na-ion migration was a minimum distance of 5 Å, where Na-ion hopping occurred between adjacent Na-ion sites. For the criteria of minimum distance for hopping, the MSD for SSEs could reach the criteria before 10 ps at 1000 K and 30 ps at 800 K
17
. A single Na-ion vacancy was introduced into the simulation cells for AIMD simulations to prevent all Na-ion sites from being occupied in crystalline systems such as Na

Abstract
Coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) techniques are capable of interrogating dynamics of nano- to mesoscale materials systems at time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. However, obtaining accurate theoretical descriptions of complex dynamics is often limited by one or more factors—the ability to visualize dynamics in real space, computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, and effectiveness of approximate or phenomenological models. In this work, we develop a data-driven framework to uncover mechanistic models of dynamics directly from time-resolved CXS measurements without solving the phase reconstruction problem for the entire time series of diffraction patterns. Our approach uses neural differential equations to parameterize unknown real-space dynamics and implements a computational scattering forward model to relate real-space predictions to reciprocal-space observations. This method is shown to recover the dynamics of several computational model systems under various simulated conditions of measurement resolution and noise. Moreover, the trained model enables estimation of long-term dynamics well beyond the maximum observation time, which can be used to inform and refine experimental parameters in practice. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental proof-of-concept by applying our framework to recover the probe trajectory from a ptychographic scan. Our proposed framework bridges the wide existing gap between approximate models and complex data.

Introduction
Coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) techniques play a critical role in the investigation of nano- and mesoscale materials systems significant to a wide variety of scientific disciplines and applications. Owing to continued advancements in source brightness, instrumentation, and detector capabilities at synchrotron X-ray facilities, alongside complementary iterative algorithms, CXS-based imaging techniques such as coherent diffraction imaging (CDI), including Bragg CDI (BCDI) and ptychography

, among many others. However, these methods depend on the ability to invert diffraction patterns into real-space images using iterative phase retrieval algorithms by exploiting certain support or overlap constraints. This typically limits dynamic imaging with coherent X-rays to isolated objects that fit within the illuminating beam
13
,
14
or to materials systems with comparatively slow dynamics. Approaches to accelerate dynamic coherent imaging have been proposed on several fronts. For instance, recent innovations in beam optics have indicated the potential for single-shot CDI and ptychography with nearly 50 nm spatial resolution using 10 ms exposures
15
,
16
, and ~5 μm spatial resolution using femtosecond pulses from a soft X-ray free-electron laser
17
. Additional spatiotemporal constraints have also been introduced either by identifying static regions of the sample computationally
14
or by employing a dual-pinhole aperture to concurrently probe dynamic and static regions of the sample plane
18
. However, inverting an entire time series of diffraction patterns frame-by-frame can be costly and is fundamentally distinct from the process of modeling the underlying dynamics, which is necessary to forecast evolving materials behavior.
Conversely, X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS)
19
,
20
is a CXS technique that exploits correlations between time-dependent fluctuations of the scattered intensity to derive insights about sample dynamics and is accessible at time scales spanning several orders of magnitude

. The analysis of intensity-intensity correlation functions yields characteristic time scales of the underlying dynamical process which can inform the development of mechanistic models; however, insights from these measurements are therefore more indirect compared to imaging methods which visualize dynamics in real space. As a result, theory development can be nontrivial for complex dynamics which differ significantly from simple diffusive behavior, particularly in out-of-equilibrium conditions
38
. This raises a need for methodologies capable of bridging the wide existing gap between approximate theoretical models and the often complicated dynamic events behind complex data.
Rather than interpret measurements through the lens of approximate models, this work aims to derive mechanistic insights about dynamics directly from data through a combination of machine learning and scientific computing techniques. The intersection of modern machine learning with scientific computing is often termed scientific machine learning, encompassing methods such as physics-informed neural networks

suggest the possibility to derive governing equations in the form of simple mathematical expressions from highly complex observations

.
In this work, we develop a data-driven framework that parameterizes unknown real-space dynamics using neural differential equations. These networks are optimized through calculation of coherent diffraction patterns from the predictions of real-space coordinates at each iteration, which are compared against the observations from time-resolved coherent scattering, either simulated or experimental. Importantly, this approach enables the discovery of dynamics without inversion of the entire time series of diffraction patterns. Instead, only real-space information at the initial conditions is needed in practice, which can be obtained, for example, through traditional CDI or ptychography under static conditions. This opens up the possibility of visualizing inaccessible, real-space dynamics evolving faster than typical CDI or ptychography experiments by relying only on a few high-fidelity measurements to establish the initial conditions and inferring subsequent dynamics from fast scans that are too challenging for phase retrieval. Additionally, the trained neural networks directly model the dynamics themselves and can therefore be used to extrapolate well beyond the training window, which can critically inform experimental design and planning. The main outcome of this work is thus a general and versatile platform for data-driven discovery of dynamics in the context of time-resolved CXS.
Results
Figure

illustrates the general workflow for the data-driven dynamical modeling approach implemented in this work. For a given system, the unknown real-space dynamics are parameterized by neural differential equations, for instance:
$$\frac{d{\boldsymbol{x}}(t)}{dt}\,\approx \,{{\boldsymbol{F}}}_{{\rm{NN}}}(t,{\boldsymbol{x}}(t);{\boldsymbol{\theta }}),$$
(1)
where
x
(
t
) are the dynamic coordinates of interest, and
θ
represents the set of trainable neural network weights. We use the term dynamic coordinates to refer to real-space variables that describe the state of the system at a given time and whose evolution is modeled by unknown differential equations. For instance, for a system of dynamic particles with known geometries, the dynamic coordinates can simply refer to particle positions; however, the dynamic coordinates can refer more generally to collective variables and even individual image pixels visualizing a physical quantity such as local electron density. Given the initial system state
x
0
specified by the chosen dynamic coordinates,
F
NN
can be numerically integrated in time to obtain the predicted time-evolution of the system,
\({\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})\)
. Normally, the predicted result is compared directly with the expected
x
(
t
) at discrete time points using a chosen loss function
43
. However, as the real-space dynamics are not directly accessible, we further incorporate a computational scattering forward model to relate the real-space predictions to reciprocal-space observations—the scattered intensities
I
(
Q
,
t
). In particular, we compute the elastic scattered intensity
\(\hat{I}({\boldsymbol{Q}},t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})\)
from a coherent X-ray probe incident on the scattering medium with predicted coordinates
\({\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})\)
. Details of the coherent scattering calculation are provided in the “Methods”. Finally, the loss
\({\mathscr{L}}\)
is defined in terms of the predicted and observed scattered intensities in reciprocal space,
\(\hat{I}({\boldsymbol{Q}},t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})\)
and
I
(
Q
,
t
), respectively.

In the following, we present several computational case studies to evaluate the performance of this framework in the context of different physical systems and experimental scenarios with increasing complexity. In each case study, we evaluate the performance of the framework using an ensemble of ten independent neural network models trained using different sets of initial parameter weights. We then establish a proof-of-concept experiment to assess the adaptation of the framework to an experimental setting.
Computational case studies
Case study 1: locally-coupled moments
We consider a system of
N
moments with fixed positions
r
j
on a square two-dimensional lattice (Fig.
2
a), each characterized by a form factor
f
(
φ
j
(
t
)) that is dependent upon the dynamic moment orientation
φ
j
(
t
). In our simulations, the time evolution of moments is modeled by the Kuramoto model
57
, which couples the time evolution of neighboring moments according to:
$$\frac{d{\varphi }_{i}(t)}{dt}=\sum _{j\in {\mathscr{N}}(i)}{a}_{ij}\sin ({\varphi }_{j}(t)-{\varphi }_{i}(t)),$$
(2)
where
\({\mathscr{N}}(i)\)
denotes the neighborhood of the
i
th moment and
a
i
j
denotes the pairwise coupling strength. We begin by approximating this ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) in which the trainable weights of the convolution kernel parameterize the coupling kernel
a
. However, rather than directly observe the evolution of moments in real space, the network is trained by comparing predicted and calculated diffraction patterns through a chosen loss function, here selected as the mean absolute error (MAE). The diffraction patterns were passed to the network in mini-batches sampled from 100 time series with different initial configurations. Each of these time series consisted of an 80 × 80 grid of moments and an 11 × 11 coupling kernel, simulated up to a maximum time
t
= 50 at time intervals of 0.5. Each random mini-batch consisted of 20 different simulations spanning a time interval of 15 (i.e., 30 time steps), thereby sampling initial conditions at different points in the dynamics up to
t
= 35. Additional details of the coherent scattering calculation are provided in the “Methods”. Figure
2
b shows the evolution of a representative coupling kernel learned over the course of training. We can see evidence of the expected symmetry in the coupling kernel emerge after approximately 150 iterations and continuously approach the target thereafter. The training histories of the coupling kernels in the 10-model ensemble are plotted in Supplementary Fig.
2
. A representative example among 50 different initial configurations is selected to show the time evolution of true and predicted system states in real space in Fig.
2
c, d, respectively. We find good agreement between the true and predicted states and diffraction patterns up to
t
= 250 (Fig.
2
h, i), five times the maximum time seen during training, indicating that the neural ODE extrapolates well beyond the training window.

). The lower panel shows the MAE between slices of the true and predicted two-time maps as a function of time; and example slice is indicated by the gray shaded rectangles. Black dotted lines denote the maximum time seen during training.
Full size image
The difference maps between the true and predicted real- and reciprocal-space images are shown in Fig.
2
e, j. We note that errors in the real-space images tend to originate and propagate along specific paths of the domain which appear to coincide with points of large vorticity, defined here as
\(\nabla \times \langle \cos ({\varphi }_{j}),\sin ({\varphi }_{j})\rangle\)
; this is examined in greater detail in Supplementary Fig.
3
a, b. Such a finding appears intuitive, as these points have the highest local variation in the moment orientations. The predictions also tend to evenly over- and underestimate the moment orientations in a given frame, evidenced by the error distributions of the real-space difference maps plotted in Supplementary Fig.
3
d. This motivates the comparison of orientation statistics between true and predicted systems as a function of time. Following ref.
58
, we compute the centroid vectors of the moment distributions:
$$r(t){e}^{i\psi (t)}=\frac{1}{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=1}^{N}{e}^{i{\varphi }_{j}(t)},$$
(3)
where
ψ
(
t
) is the average moment orientation and
r
(
t
) is an order parameter quantifying the degree of uniformity in the moments. Figure
2
f, d shows the calculated
ψ
and
r
for the example visualized in Fig.
2
c, d, indicating relatively good agreement. The discrepancy in
ψ
between
t
= 125 and
t
= 150 is potentially caused by the fact that the coherent scattering calculation is an even function of the moment orientations, leading to a potential ambiguity about 0. Alternately, as this discrepancy coincides with a reduction in the true order parameter,
r
, it may be due to local changes in the ground truth dynamics that occur only later in the prediction. However, it is worth noting that the order parameter, which has possible values between 0 and 1, is consistently small overall as the moments are never fully synchronous due to the choice of coupling kernel, which leads to the characteristic formation of striped domains. As stated, the example shown in Fig.
2
is representative of the average performance of the model ensemble across 50 different initial configurations (Supplementary Fig.
4
a). Simulations which were comparatively less and more challenging to predict accurately, as given by the real-space MAE, are shown in Supplementary Figs.
5
and
6
, respectively.
Regarding the evaluation of errors in reciprocal space, it is worth comparing the diffraction patterns obtained from the true and predicted dynamics in terms of not only the loss function used for training, but also the expected intensity-intensity correlations that would be obtained in an XPCS setting. Specifically, we compute the two-time correlation function,
C
2
(
Q
,
t
1
,
t
2
)
59
,
60
, of the true and predicted diffraction patterns for each of the 10 models in the ensemble. These correlation functions were calculated by taking the azimuthal averages at the equivalent
Q
indicated by the white dashed line in Fig.
2
h. Additional details of the
C
2
calculations are provided in the “Methods”. Figure
2
k compares the true
C
2
against the average
C
2
obtained from the 10-model ensemble. We find very good agreement until approximately
t
= 125, at which point the predicted dynamics remain slightly faster than the true, though both continue to progressively slow down as the moment orientations synchronize. This is corroborated by the values of the correlation time
τ
as a function of
t
1
, which we obtain by fitting the one-time correlation functions extracted at fixed observation times (Supplementary Fig.
4
d)
59
. Since the networks are trained on observations at early times when dynamics are generally faster, they may be more likely to slightly overestimate the rates of dynamics in a slower regime, particularly when the onset is abrupt. The divergence in
C
2
also approximately coincides with the discrepancy in mean orientations discussed earlier, which is supported by the fact that the true dynamics begin to slow down more rapidly than the predicted around this time. Though beyond the scope of the present work, directly incorporating
C
2
into the loss function may be able to further strengthen these results.
Finally, we note that the CNN model can successfully learn the local coupling kernel even when the trainable weights overparameterize the true kernel, i.e., we allow for a receptive field greater than 11 × 11 in the present example. As an example, Supplementary Fig.
7
shows the results of training on the same dataset but with a convolution kernel of size 21 × 21, which also converges to the expected result.
Case study 2: self-organizing particles
To evaluate the performance of the framework on more complex learning tasks beyond parameter estimation, we next consider clustering dynamics in a collection of interacting particles with full spatial degrees of freedom in which the unknown dynamics are governed by a continuous-valued function. Following the work of ref.
61
, we model the evolution of each particle’s spatial coordinates,
r
i
, according to:
$$\frac{d{{\bf{r}}}_{i}(t)}{dt}=\frac{1}{n}\sum _{j\in {{\mathscr{N}}}_{R}(i)}h({{\bf{r}}}_{j}-{{\bf{r}}}_{i})(1-h({{\bf{r}}}_{j}-{{\bf{r}}}_{i}))({{\bf{r}}}_{j}-{{\bf{r}}}_{i}),$$
(4)
where
\({{\mathscr{N}}}_{R}\)
enumerates particles found within a cutoff radius
R
of the
i
th particle,
h
(
r
j
−
r
i
) is a smooth cutoff function which determines the interaction potential, and
n
is a normalizing factor which scales with the size of the simulation box,
L
, as
n
= (2/
L
)
2
. To obtain a system which exhibits clustering, we model the cutoff function as a short-range interaction according to
62
:
$$h(r)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{R}{2r}\left(1+\tanh \left(\frac{1}{r-R}-\frac{1}{r-2R}\right)\right)\quad &r\,\le\, R\\ 0\quad &r \,> \,R,\end{array}\right.$$
(5)
where
r
=
∣
r
∣
. In this case study, we simulate dynamics from 50 different initial configurations, each comprising 500 identical particles with a radius of 0.03
L
and with a cutoff radius of
R
= 0.15
L
for particle interactions. We parameterize the cutoff function using the neural network illustrated in Fig.
3
a, which is trained through observation of the calculated diffraction patterns from mini-batches of 4 different initial configurations at a time. Each mini-batch is sampled from the full simulation time of
t
= 10 in batch times of 2 at time intervals of 0.1 (i.e., 20 time steps per batch). Because the particle interactions are governed by a shared pairwise potential, we implement this network in the form of a graph neural ODE:
$$\frac{d{{\bf{r}}}_{i}(t)}{dt}\,\approx \,\frac{1}{n}\sum _{j\in {{\mathscr{N}}}_{R}(i)}{F}_{{\rm{NN}}}(t,r;R,{\boldsymbol{\theta }})(1-{F}_{{\rm{NN}}}(t,r;R,{\boldsymbol{\theta }}))({{\bf{r}}}_{j}-{{\bf{r}}}_{i}),$$
(6)
where
F
NN
denotes the neural network,
R
is a trainable parameter representing the cutoff radius, and
θ
represents the remaining trainable weights of the neural network. Here,
F
NN
is a feed-forward neural network comprising the input and output layers and three hidden layers each with 10 neurons (Fig.
3
a). Each layer prior to the output is activated by a leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU), and a softplus is used as the final activation to smoothly enforce positivity. At each iteration of the training loop, a set of graphs is constructed based on the neighborhood defined by the current estimate of the cutoff radius,
R
(
k
)
. This requires a more tailored initialization of the network weights to ensure that the initial interaction potential is sufficiently short-ranged and that the corresponding graphs are not exceedingly large. To do this, we use the diffraction pattern obtained at
t
= 10 to inform the initial estimate of the cutoff radius,
R
(0)
, which is detailed in the “Methods” and Supplementary Fig.
8
. This estimate is used to pretrain the neural network such that the initial model is a decreasing function of
r
which intercepts the
x
-axis at
R
(0)
. The network is subsequently trained to reproduce the simulated diffraction patterns as in the previous case study, updating all trainable parameters including
R
. Figure
3
b shows the true and learned cutoff functions, indicating good agreement. Note that the value of the learned parameter
R
is not necessarily equivalent to the true
R
in a convergent model, as it is multiplied to other trainable weights in the network. However, its value must be greater than or equal to that of the true cutoff radius in order to encompass all relevant particle interactions. The true value of
R
can subsequently be derived from the learned cutoff function.

Figure
3
e shows the evolution of the predicted state of the system in real space for one representative model and initial condition, in good qualitative agreement with the true system state (Fig.
3
d) even up to five times the maximum time seen during training. We compute the mean squared error (MSE) between the centers of mass of the true and predicted states up to
t
= 50 for all 10 models in the ensemble across 50 different initial configurations. These statistics appear quite similar across all models (Supplementary Fig.
10
a), likely due to pretraining each model to a similar initial starting point. Figure
3
f further indicates the evolution of cluster size distribution for both true (top) and predicted (bottom) states of the system. Cluster sizes are defined as the number of particles in an isolated group; specifically, this constitutes a connected graph with a maximum edge length
d
, where
d
is approximately the center of the first peak in the distribution of all pairwise particle distances (e.g., Supplementary Fig.
8
c). Both distributions initially exhibit a large peak at very small cluster sizes, signifying the random initial state, and evolve toward a distribution centered at larger cluster sizes.
Using the true and predicted diffraction patterns, we also compute the two-time correlation functions,
C
2
, at equivalent values of
Q
indicated by the black dashed circle in Fig.
3
g. Figure
3
c shows qualitatively similar behavior between the
C
2
maps of true (upper triangle) and average predicted (lower triangle) dynamics of the 10-model ensemble. In particular, we observe a shift from fast to comparatively slow dynamics as the clusters form and stabilize, with a temporary acceleration of the dynamics at intermediate times between
t
= 30 and
t
= 40. The lower panel of Fig.
3
c quantifies the MAE between the true and predicted two-time correlations, showing excellent agreement until approximately
t
= 25, which coincides with the period of acceleration during which relatively isolated particles in the vacant space between clusters are pulled rapidly toward a nearby, well-formed cluster. This is corroborated by the correlation times determined by fitting the one-time correlation functions extracted from the two-time maps as a function of time, plotted in Supplementary Fig.
10
e. This behavior is affected by the accuracy of the cutoff radius, as slight differences can modulate the particle interactions included at the boundary and thus generate some discrepancies in the prediction. This makes the two-time correlation more sensitive to differences between the 10 models compared to the center of mass, as evidenced by the statistics of the MAE between the true and predicted
C
2
for the same 50 initial configurations, shown in Supplementary Fig.
10
b. Supplementary Fig.
10
c, d depicts the
C
2
maps of a comparatively better and worse predicted trajectory, respectively. Their corresponding real-space analyses are shown in Supplementary Fig.
11
. Overall, the more difficult cases exhibit shorter correlation times with more abrupt changes at intermediate times, which can be seen by comparing Supplementary Fig.
10
f, g. Nonetheless, the overall ability of the model to extrapolate with qualitative and often quantitative accuracy is a valuable source of insight into future behavior of systems with evolving rates of dynamics which may become experimentally inaccessible at long times.
Case study 3: fluctuating source
In the previous case studies, the learning tasks were simplified by employing neural networks to approximate specific terms of the governing equations, such as the coupling kernel in the first example. While a larger neural network was used to approximate the cutoff function in the case of self-organizing particles, it represented only part of a larger equation with a known expected form. In the final case study, we develop a learning task in which the governing equations are modeled entirely by a neural network without prior knowledge of the functional form. For this problem, we consider a source with positional fluctuations that is used to probe a stationary test pattern formed by the random arrangement of
N
= 400 particles with radii 0.07
L
, where
L
is the length of the simulation box. The source fluctuation leads to an evolving field-of-view of the object under investigation, as shown in Fig.
4
b; thus, by recovering the apparent dynamics of the object as seen from the reference frame of the fluctuating source, the complementary source dynamics can be derived. In this case study, we define the perceived dynamics of the object to be a periodic function of its center of mass coordinates,
x
(
t
) and
y
(
t
), modeled after the coupled Lotka-Volterra equations

where
α

are fixed parameters. In our simulations, we used the set of parameters
α
= 1/3,
β
= 2/3,
γ
= 1/2,
δ
= 1/2, which corresponds to periodic oscillations of the coordinates with a period of
\(2\pi /\sqrt{\alpha \gamma }\,\approx \,15.39\)
64
. Since the Lotka-Volterra equations constitute a conservative system, the periodic solutions form closed orbits along which the conserved quantity,
\(V=\delta x-\gamma \ln (x)+\beta y-\alpha \ln (y)\)
, is constant. We define a fully-connected neural network
F
NN
which approximates the ODE governing the evolution of

where
θ
represents the set of trainable neural network weights. Here,
F
NN
comprises an input and output layer with two neurons each, and three hidden layers each with 10 neurons (Fig.
4
a). Each layer prior to the output is activated by a rectified linear unit (ReLU). The network is trained through comparison of predicted and calculated diffraction patterns from 100 different time series simulated up to a maximum time
t
= 16, or approximately one period, at time intervals of 2. Each time series corresponds to different particle arrangements—or samples—which are generated uniformly at random within the square simulation box of length
L
. The sample centers are defined as the origin in each simulation and coincide roughly with the initial position of the probe; however, due to the random sampling, there are slight differences in the location of the sample centers and hence initial positions of the probe among the 100 different time series. During training, mini-batches of 10 time series are randomly drawn with a batch time of 16, i.e., the full extent of the simulation.

The time evolution of the true and predicted coordinates up to
t
= 500 is shown in Fig.
4
c in terms of the average and standard deviation among the ensemble of 10 models. We also plot the value of the conserved quantity,
V
, in Fig.
4
c. Since the neural network models are not explicitly constrained to be conservative systems, the learned trajectories can deviate slightly from the closed orbits expected analytically; as a result, the values of
V
are only approximately level and fluctuate near the true value. Plots of the corresponding true and predicted real- and reciprocal-space images are shown in Supplementary Fig.
12
. Overall, the true and predicted trajectories appear to be in good agreement, with more obvious discrepancies appearing at approximately
t
= 200. Observations at later times reveal that, on average, the learned period is slightly shorter than that of the true dynamics, resulting in a gradual divergence of true and predicted trajectories. We can quantify the difference between these trajectories by comparing their Fourier spectra, which exhibit sharp peaks corresponding to the frequencies of oscillation. We then compute the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), defined as the absolute difference between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the Fourier spectra, between the true and predicted trajectories from 50 different initial configurations for each of the 10 models. This is shown for three representative simulations with average, good, and poor performance across the 10 models in Supplementary Fig.
13
a–c, whose results are visualized in Fig.
4
and Supplementary Fig.
14
a, b, respectively.
We obtain further insight into the source of the observed discrepancy by comparing the learned ODEs of each of the 10 models against the ground truth (Fig.
4
d). In particular, Supplementary Fig.
13
e–i shows the learned ODEs of five models with varying distributions of EMD error across the 50 different simulations, while Fig.
4
e shows the average learned ODE across the entire ensemble. The ODEs appear to agree most in the vicinity of the true object trajectory, indicated by the black dashed line in each of the visualizations, which is further corroborated by the plot of the standard deviation across all 10 models shown in Fig.
4
f. Away from the trajectory and particularly at the boundaries of the domain, the ODEs learned by individual models do not necessarily recover the expected behavior, likely due to the lack of observations in these regions. By consequence, the ensemble-average shown in Fig.
4
e resembles the ground truth ODE better than any individual model. This motivates developing an ensemble model by averaging the ODEs of the individual trained networks rather than taking the averages of their solutions, which we show in Fig.
4
c by the orange line overlaying the true and average solutions. We also repeat the quantitative analysis in terms of Fourier spectra in Supplementary Fig.
13
a–d. In practice, when the ground truth ODE is unknown, the analysis of learned ODEs described here is envisioned to provide both a measure of uncertainty for different regions of the domain spanned by the relevant dynamic coordinates, as well as insight into the expected symmetries and overall complexity of the learned model, which could be used to place physical constraints on the network architecture or inform the use of regularization methods. While beyond the scope of the current work, the learned governing equations could further be used to guide theory development, for example by decomposition to an appropriate functional basis through methods like sparse regression.
Measurement noise and resolution
In practice, experimental noise reduces the quality of measured data, leading to sometimes significant differences between calculated and measured diffraction patterns. Additionally, variations in X-ray probe size and coherence as well as detector resolution can affect the clarity of reciprocal-space features. Thus, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the effects of experimental noise, probe size, coherence, and detector resolution on model performance. We repeated the training for the coupled moments case study across nine different levels of Poisson noise, five different values for detector resolution,
Δ
Q
, five different values for the standard deviation of the Gaussian probe,
σ
p
, and five different degrees of coherence. Poisson noise was introduced in the training data by using the calculated diffraction patterns to sample from a Poisson distribution in which the intensity acts as a proxy for the expected event frequency,
λ
. Specifically, we scaled the normalized intensity by a chosen factor
\({\lambda }_{\max }\)
, the maximum expected event frequency, and resampled each pixel value from the Poisson distribution with
λ
given by the corresponding scaled intensity. To place the absolute intensities of true and predicted diffraction patterns on equal footing during training without explicit knowledge of
\({\lambda }_{\max }\)
, we leverage the fact that at the initial condition, where the real-space solution is assumed to be known, the predicted diffraction pattern should approximate the true pattern without noise. Thus, we can rescale all diffraction patterns by the factor needed to bring the true and predicted patterns into agreement at the initial condition. This was empirically found to perform better than normalizing all patterns by their respective maximum or average intensities. The model was trained for the noise-free case as well as eight different noise levels between
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{0}\)
and
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{7}\)
. For
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{2}\)
through
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{7}\)
, the neural ODEs were trained using a MAE loss, as was done in the perfect case. For
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{0}\)
and
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{1}\)
, the Poisson statistics become significant and a Poisson negative log likelihood (NLL) was used instead.
Figure
5
a shows the effect of increasing levels of noise (decreasing
\({\lambda }_{\max }\)
) on the mean absolute error between the true and predicted real-space coordinates,
φ
and
\(\hat{{\boldsymbol{\varphi }}}\)
, of the coupled moments at the final extrapolated frame,
t
= 250. The results shown are an average over 50 different initial conditions, with error bars denoting one standard deviation. Representative diffraction patterns corresponding to each noise level are displayed above each point. In the most severe case of
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{0}\)
, the average MAE is approximately 3.6 times that of the perfect case trained without noise. Similarly, we visualize the learned coupling kernels and plot the errors as a function of
\({\lambda }_{\max }\)
in Fig.
5
b. For
\({\lambda }_{\max } > 1{0}^{3}\)
, the MAE falls within the maximum error found for the 10-model ensemble under perfect conditions, suggesting robustness to noise until approximately
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{3}\)
. While the learned coupling kernel is less well-resolved at higher noise levels, the anticipated symmetry and overall pattern is still evident. As an example, we show representative images of true and predicted real- and reciprocal-space patterns for the case of
\({\lambda }_{\max }=1{0}^{1}\)
in detail in Fig.
5
c–h. Additional images for all simulated values of
\({\lambda }_{\max }\)
are reported in Supplementary Fig.

Finally, we also report the performance of the proposed framework on detector resolution, probe size, and coherence. Detector resolution was varied from
Δ
Q = π/L to ΔQ = 3π/L. We note that, for the probe size of σ
p
= L/4 used in these examples, the last 3 values of ΔQ fall outside of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion, which requires that ΔQ ≤ 2π/W, where W is the transverse size of a finite object or alternately of the illuminated area
65
,
66
. In our example, W was defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian probe. Examples with ΔQ > 2π/W could not be unambiguously inverted to the corresponding real-space images, further motivating use of the proposed framework. When varying probe size, ΔQ was maintained at π/L while σ
p
was varied between 0.15L and 0.35L. Finally, we vary the degree of coherence by convolving the scattered intensity with the Fourier transform of a Gaussian mutual coherence function (MCF) with a standard deviation σ
coh
67
, which we varied from fully coherent (σ
coh
≥ 3L) to σ
coh
= L/4. Figure
6
a–c shows representative diffraction patterns varying the resolution, probe size, and coherence, respectively. In nearly all cases, we found that the average MAE between the true and predicted real-space coordinates at the final extrapolated frame across 50 different initial configurations was not statistically different from that under the original conditions used for this case study. The only exception was the case of σ
coh
= L/4, for which the error was approximately 10 times that of the perfectly coherent case. While there appears to be some variation in the errors between learned and true kernels under different conditions, it is still well below the discrepancy seen between the kernels of very noisy (
\({\lambda }_{\max } > 1{0}^{2}\)
) and noise-free examples and is most likely the result of differences in the models’ weight initialization and training history. For reference, we indicate the minimum and maximum MAEs found for the 10-model ensemble under the original conditions used for this case study in each plot; all MAEs are found to be within this range, except that at a partial coherence of σ
coh
= L/4. As a result, we conclude that the model’s performance is relatively insensitive to most relevant conditions for detector resolution, probe size, and coherence that may be encountered experimentally.

Experimental proof-of-concept
To investigate the performance of the proposed framework in an experimental context, we develop a simple proof-of-concept relying on experimental diffraction data for learning. In particular, we considered the problem of recovering the trajectory of an X-ray beam scanned across an object along a predefined path from the resulting coherent diffraction data. To do this, we used X-ray ptychographic data obtained from a tungsten test pattern as reported in ref.
68
. In this experiment, coherent diffraction patterns were obtained with 0.3 s acquisitions over a regular grid of scan points across a tungsten test pattern etched with random features (Supplementary Fig.
17
a). The real-space amplitude and phase of the object as well as the complex probe were then recovered using an iterative phase retrieval algorithm. We refer to ref.
68
for additional details about the experimental dataset. To define the learning task for this case study, we considered a continuous trajectory through the scan points given by:
$$\begin{array}{ll}\displaystyle\frac{dx}{dt}\,=\,\frac{1}{2\sqrt{t}}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{t}}-\omega y\right)\\\displaystyle \,\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{t}}\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{t}}+\omega x\right),\end{array}$$
(9)
where
x
(
t
) and
y
(
t
) are coordinates of the center of the incident beam in the plane of the object, and
ω
= 4 is a constant parameter. These equations describe a circular spiral centered on the test pattern. For the training data, we isolated a segment of this trajectory, shown in Fig.
7
a, comprising 80 sequential scan points starting at a time
t
0
> 0 which approximately span one revolution. At each scan point along the trajectory, a diffraction pattern of 512 × 512 pixels is obtained as the square modulus of the Fourier transform of the illuminated real-space object multiplied by the complex probe. A representative real- and reciprocal-space pair is shown in Fig.
7
b, e. The learning task in this proof-of-concept resembles that of the fluctuating source case study; namely, recovering two degrees of freedom specifying the motion of the probe over a stationary sample. However, apart from differences in the dynamical equations, the proof-of-concept experiment also differs from the final case study in that the beam is focused by a Fresnel zone plate and the sample can be regarded as effectively infinite. To predict the trajectory from experimental data, we define the neural network
F
NN
which approximates the ODE governing the evolution of
r
(
t
) = 〈
x
(
t
),
y
(
t
)〉 according to:
$$\frac{d{\boldsymbol{r}}(t)}{dt}\,\approx\, {{\boldsymbol{F}}}_{{\rm{NN}}}(t,{\boldsymbol{r}}(t);{\boldsymbol{\theta }}),$$
(10)
where
θ
represents the set of trainable neural network weights. The network architecture of
F
NN
is shown in Fig.
7
h. Due to the disparate scales of the spatial and time coordinates, a shallow network is first used to featurize
t
, which is then passed to a deeper network along with the current value of
r
(
t
) to predict
d
r
/
d
t
. To extract the appropriate frames centered at arbitrary values of
r
(
t
), an interpolating function of the full real-space image was first calculated using a regular grid interpolant and could then be sampled at arbitrary values of
r
(
t
) predicted by the network. Figure
7
c shows the real-space image at the predicted scan location for the same time point shown in Fig.
7
b, along with the calculated diffraction pattern (Fig.
7
f). As in the computational case studies, true and predicted diffraction patterns were compared using their mean absolute error in order to train the network. The network was trained through comparison of predicted and experimental diffraction patterns of 80 sequential time points which capture approximately one periodic cycle, using mini-batches of size 5 with a batch time of 35 time points. The time evolution of the true and predicted coordinates of the trained network are shown in Fig.
7
i up to twice the maximum time observed during training, at which point the trajectories are seen to gradually diverge. This results from a slight dilation of the predicted path compared to the true, which is illustrated in the visualization of the true and predicted trajectories in Fig.
7
i. We quantify the accumulated error in the predicted path in terms of the angular lag at the final extrapolation point, which is about 0.11
π
. Due to the quasi-periodic nature of the motion, we also include a comparison of the true and predicted Fourier spectra, as performed in the final computational case study, in Supplementary Fig.
17
b. Nonetheless, the qualitative behavior at long times remains comparable between true and predicted trajectories. Additional real- and reciprocal-space images along the trajectory are reported in Supplementary Fig.
18
. While simple, this learning task serves as a valuable proof-of-concept that the proposed framework is transferable to experimental datasets and is a helpful reference point for assessing performance on more complicated systems with unknown dynamics.

Discussion
As the framework developed in this work is envisioned as a general tool for extracting dynamics from coherent scattering measurements, here we emphasize several practical considerations for its use. First, it is important to recognize that the learned equations generalize only to different initial conditions of the dynamic system on which the model was trained. Therefore, a key use case of a trained model is expected to be the extrapolation of dynamics beyond experimentally-accessible observations, which can inform the design and planning of experiments. We note that the case studies explored in this work generally approach a more static state or are in a fluctuating equilibrium; as a result, capturing dynamics that explicitly accelerate with time may require further development of the method. Additional applications of the trained model include computational investigation of dynamics proceeding from different initial conditions from those available at training time, and guidance toward the development of theoretical models of complex dynamics through analysis of the learned ODE.
Second, accurate information about the real-space object and relevant dynamic coordinates is needed at the initial conditions. This generally assumes that longer acquisitions of the system under relatively static conditions can be conducted and used to recover the real-space image at the initial state, for instance through traditional phase retrieval methods. As an example, we propose that certain emergent dynamics, which are tunable by external stimuli such as light
69
, temperature, or electric or magnetic fields
70
and drive the system toward a new phase or state of equilibrium, could be suitable first-experiments for validating the proposed framework by enabling comparatively static scans to be captured at the initial conditions followed by fast measurements of subsequent dynamics.
Finally, there is an inherent trade-off between problem complexity and the dimensionality of the selected dynamic coordinates, which is often determined by available prior knowledge about the scattering medium. For instance, in the case study of coupled moments, the diffracted intensity was modulated by the changing orientation of moments via an effective form factor while keeping moment positions fixed. In the remaining two case studies, changes in object positions relative to the incident beam governed intensity fluctuations while form factors were fixed functions of
Q
. Generalizations of these learning tasks with fewer prior assumptions are possible but were not explored in the present work. For instance, the form factors in the latter two case studies could be implemented as trainable functions given an informed initial guess, e.g., a spherical form factor of an estimated particle size used to initialize the approximation of a more irregularly shaped scatterer. Even more generally, individual pixels of the real-space image can be considered dynamic coordinates provided a sufficiently large neural network approximator. Though not explored in the present work, these reformulations of the learning tasks can be readily performed within the proposed framework and may be necessary when working with experimental samples that are less well understood.
In conclusion, we demonstrated the application of a scientific machine learning framework that enables the extraction of physical insights about real-space dynamics directly from time-resolved coherent scattering measurements. This framework parameterizes unknown real-space dynamics using neural differential equations of the system’s dynamic coordinates, which are optimized by comparing the time series of true and predicted coherent diffraction patterns. Real-space information is needed only at the initial conditions, making it possible to perform high-fidelity measurements only under static conditions and fast scans thereafter to enable inference of subsequent dynamics. The performance of the framework is evaluated in the context of three different computational systems and an experimental proof-of-concept, demonstrating its versatility and potential applications. In practice, this framework is envisioned to assist and accelerate data interpretation and theory development from coherent scattering in a broad range of materials systems, thereby advancing our understanding of dynamic phenomena at the mesoscale.
Methods
Coherent scattering calculations
We compute the elastic scattered intensity from a coherent X-ray probe incident on the scattering medium with predicted coordinates
\({\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})\)
as
71
:
$$\hat{I}({\boldsymbol{Q}},t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})={\left| \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j = 1}^{N}P({\boldsymbol{Q}})* {f}_{j}({\boldsymbol{Q}},{\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }})){e}^{i{\boldsymbol{Q}}\cdot {{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}({\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }}))}\right| }^{2},$$
(11)
where
Q
denotes the wavevector change, and the scattering medium, i.e., real-space object, comprises
N
scatterers with positions
\({{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}({\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }}))\)
and form factors
\({f}_{j}({\boldsymbol{Q}},{\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}}(t;{\boldsymbol{\theta }}))\)
, each with potential dependence on the dynamic coordinates of interest.
P
(
Q
) is the Fourier transform of the X-ray probe function, and * denotes convolution. We model the illumination of the scattering medium by the X-ray probe as a two-dimensional Gaussian. This is incorporated by convolving the Fourier transform of the object with that of the Gaussian illumination function prior to computing its square modulus. Typically, the bright, unscattered beam at the center is obstructed to protect the detector and was therefore also masked in the intensity calculations performed here. As long as the scattering forward model remains a differentiable function of the inputs, additional refinement to the calculation can be incorporated to better reflect experimental conditions. Below, we write the explicit intensity calculations used in each of the three computational case studies.
Case study 1: locally-coupled moments
In the case of locally-coupled moments, the dynamic coordinates were the moment orientations
φ
j
(
t
) relative to the incident beam. All moments were considered spatially fixed on a square lattice at positions
r
j
. To capture the time-evolution of the moment orientations, the form factor was modeled as a function of
φ
j
(
t
) and governed the time-evolution of the scattered intensity. To maintain generality, the total scattered intensity was modeled as the incoherent sum of
φ
-independent and -dependent contributions,
I
(0)
and
I
(1)
, respectively, i.e.:
$$I({\boldsymbol{Q}},t)={I}^{(0)}({\boldsymbol{Q}})+{I}^{(1)}({\boldsymbol{Q}},t).$$
(12)
As this system exhibited no time-dependent evolution of
r
j
, the first term was a radially-symmetric function of
Q
for all
t
given by:
$${I}^{(0)}({\boldsymbol{Q}})={\left| P({\boldsymbol{Q}})* \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j = 1}^{N}{f}^{(0)}{e}^{i{\boldsymbol{Q}}\cdot {{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}}\right| }^{2},$$
(13)
where
f
(0)
is constant. The second term was given by:
$${I}^{(1)}({\boldsymbol{Q}},t)={\left| P({\boldsymbol{Q}})* \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j = 1}^{N}{f}^{(1)}({\varphi }_{j}(t)){e}^{i{\boldsymbol{Q}}\cdot {{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}}\right| }^{2},$$
(14)
where
\({f}^{(1)}({\varphi }_{j}(t))=\cos ({\varphi }_{j}(t))\)
. In Supplementary Fig.
1
, we visualize the key quantities relevant to the scattering calculation at a given time point. The left panel shows the real-space object
\({\mathscr{O}}({\boldsymbol{r}})\)
overlaid with the Gaussian illumination function
p
(
r
). The middle panel shows the convolution kernel corresponding to the truncated Fourier transform of the Gaussian probe,
\(P({\boldsymbol{Q}})={\mathscr{F}}\{p({\boldsymbol{r}})\}\)
, where
\({\mathscr{F}}\)
denotes the Fourier transform. Finally, the right panel shows
I
(
Q
) for the corresponding
\({\mathscr{O}}({\boldsymbol{r}})\)
and
P
(
Q
).
Case study 2: self-organizing particles
In the case of self-organizing particles, the dynamic coordinates were the particle positions
r
j
(
t
). As all particles were considered to be identical, the same form factor amplitude
f
s
(
Q
) was used for each particle, given by:
$${f_{\!s}}({\boldsymbol{Q}})=\frac{3}{{(Qa)}^{3}}\left(\sin (Qa)-Qa\cos (Qa)\right),$$
(15)
where
Q
=
∣
Q
∣
and
a
is the particle radius. The final intensity was then calculated as:
$$I({\boldsymbol{Q}},t)={\left| P({\boldsymbol{Q}})* \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j = 1}^{N}{f}_{s}({\boldsymbol{Q}}){e}^{i{\boldsymbol{Q}}\cdot {{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}(t)}\right| }^{2}.$$
(16)
Case study 3: fluctuating source
In the case of the fluctuating source, the dynamic coordinates were the center of mass coordinates of the object under observation,
r
(
t
) = 〈
x
(
t
),
y
(
t
)〉. Since the object consisted of
N
identical particles with fixed relative positions, the center of mass coordinates were related to the instantaneous particle locations through:
$${\boldsymbol{r}}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=1}^{N}{{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}(t)$$
(17)
All particles were considered to be identical, and hence the same form factor
f
s
(
Q
) was used for each particle as in the case of self-organizing particles. The intensity was then calculated in the same manner according to:
$$I({\boldsymbol{Q}},t)={\left| P({\boldsymbol{Q}})* \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j = 1}^{N}{f}_{\!s}({\boldsymbol{Q}}){e}^{i{\boldsymbol{Q}}\cdot {{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{j}(t)}\right| }^{2}.$$
(18)
Machine learning
We implement this framework using
PyTorch
72
and employ the
torchdiffeq
73
library of ODE solvers for numerical integration, which supports backpropagation through ODE solutions using the adjoint sensitivity method. Neural networks were trained using the Adam optimizer, with mini-batching performed both on realizations of the dynamical system (i.e., initial conditions) and in time. The initial learning rates were empirically set to 5 × 10
−3
, 10
−3
, and 10
−2
for the three computational case studies, respectively, and to 3 × 10
−4
for the experimental proof-of-concept. In all cases, learning rates were reduced by a factor of 2 over the course of training if the loss increased by more than twice the running average value. Training concluded when the loss no longer improved appreciably compared to batch-to-batch fluctuations.
Two-time correlation function calculations
We calculate the two-time correlation function as the autocovariance of the intensity normalized by its standard deviation

,

:
$${C}_{2}(Q,{t}_{1},{t}_{2})=\frac{\langle I(Q,{t}_{1})I(Q,{t}_{2})\rangle -\langle I(Q,{t}_{1})\rangle \langle I(Q,{t}_{2})\rangle }{\sqrt{\langle I{(Q,{t}_{1})}^{2}\rangle -{\langle I(Q,{t}_{1})\rangle }^{2}}\sqrt{\langle I{(Q,{t}_{2})}^{2}\rangle -{\langle I(Q,{t}_{2})\rangle }^{2}}},$$

where
I
(
Q

t

) are intensities at times
t

and
t
2
at a scattering wavevector of magnitude
Q
, and 〈
⋅

Q
. When extracting one-time correlation functions from the two-time maps, the delay time direction is taken along lines perpendicular to the

Pretraining details for case study 2
As noted in the main text, proper initialization of the network describing pairwise particle interactions is necessary to ensure that the initial interaction potential is sufficiently short-ranged. To inform this initialization without detailed knowledge of the underlying system, we outline and validate a simple procedure based only on the available diffraction patterns of the evolving system. In particular, as the system approaches a clustered state, we observe the emergence of a bright ring of diffraction spots close to the central peak, highlighted in Supplementary Fig.
8
a. Such systematic modulations of intensity are often indicative of structural symmetries in real-space; in fact, the bright features appear at a length scale comparable to the average spacing between neighboring clusters (Supplementary Fig.
8
b). By histogramming all pairwise particle distances in the final simulation frame (Supplementary Fig.
8
c), we find that this length scale corresponds closely with the second peak of the resulting distribution, i.e., the average distance between neighboring clusters. (The first peak near 0 corresponds to pairwise distances between particles of the same cluster.) This suggests that the length scale corresponding to the emergent features is a reasonable initial choice for the initial cutoff radius,
R
(0)
. This estimate is used to pretrain the neural network such that the initial model is a decreasing function of
r
which intercepts the
x
-axis at
R
(0)
. Specifically, we pretrain
\({F}_{{\rm{NN}}}^{(0)}\)
to approximate:
$${F}_{{\rm{NN}}}^{(0)}(t,r;R,{\boldsymbol{\theta }})\,\approx\, \frac{1}{n}\frac{{R}^{(0)}-r}{r}.$$
(20)
Supplementary Fig.
8
d plots the predicted cutoff function before (left) and after (right) pretraining. This ensures that the initial interaction potential is short-ranged and therefore suitable for constructing graphs based on pairwise particle interactions. As expected, the pretrained network is still far from the target solution, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig.
8
e, f. Supplementary Fig.
8
f shows the time evolution of the predicted states of the system at selected time points up to
t
= 50, which do not match the expected dynamics (Supplementary Fig.
8
e). This is further reflected in the discrepancy between true and predicted cluster size distributions, shown in Supplementary Fig.
8
g. The pretrained model greatly overestimates cluster spacing because the initial estimate of the cutoff function is highly approximate; its purpose is only to reasonably restrict the size of the graphs to exclude unnecessarily long-ranged interactions. We also observe significant differences between the true and predicted diffraction patterns at the final state in Supplementary Fig.
8
h–j. Thus, it is necessary to further refine the cutoff function in order to obtain the optimized results shown in Fig.
3
, which is accomplished by further training the network following the proposed framework.

Abstract
Accurate computation of the gas adsorption properties of MOFs is usually bottlenecked by the DFT calculations required to generate partial atomic charges. Therefore, large virtual screenings of MOFs often use the QEq method which is rapid, but of limited accuracy. Recently, machine learning (ML) models have been trained to generate charges in much better agreement with DFT-derived charges compared to the QEq models. Previous ML charge models for MOFs have all used training sets with less than 3000 MOFs obtained from the CoRE MOF database, which has recently been shown to have high structural error rates. In this work, we developed a graph attention network model for predicting DFT-derived charges in MOFs where the model was developed with the ARC-MOF database that contains 279,632 MOFs and over 40 million charges. This model, which we call
MEPO-ML
, predicts charges with a mean absolute error of 0.025e on our test set of over 27 K MOFs. Other ML models reported in the literature were also trained using the same dataset and descriptors, and MEPO-ML was shown to give the lowest errors. The gas adsorption properties evaluated using MEPO-ML charges are found to be in significantly better agreement with the reference DFT-derived charges compared to the empirical charges, for both polar and non-polar gases. Using only a single CPU core on our benchmark computer, MEPO-ML charges can be generated in less than two seconds on average (including all computations required to apply the model) for MOFs in the test set of 27 K MOFs.

Introduction
Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have attracted significant attention as next-generation solid sorbents for gas separation and storage applications such as CO
2
capture. For example, the MOF CALF-20 is being used in an adsorption-based process that is being deployed at an industrial scale to remove CO
2
from cement-making flues and is now being synthesized in over 1.5-ton batches
1
,
2
. The attractive feature of MOFs is their tunability which arises from the seemingly infinite number of structural building units (SBUs) that can combine in thousands of different network topologies to form structures with a daunting variety of geometric and chemical features. It is estimated that over 100,000 MOFs have been synthesized and crystallographically characterized, with new materials being continually reported
3
. Additionally, various computer algorithms
4
,
5
,
6
have been developed to construct hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures where millions have been used in the curation of various databases

High throughput virtual screening studies have been performed on databases of both experimental and hypothetical MOFs to identify high-performing materials for a variety of applications. For gas separation and storage applications, a material’s performance is often evaluated in terms of its uptake capacity and selectivity. These properties can be computed via atomistic grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Here the guest-host interaction energies are commonly approximated by atom-pair based van der Waals potentials (e.g., Lennard-Jones potentials), and Coulomb potentials using partial atomic charges. While the parameters used in the van der Waals potentials are largely considered to be transferable between different MOFs, the partial atomic charges used for the Coulomb interactions are highly dependent on the chemical environment of the atoms and therefore need to be re-computed for each individual material. There are many types of partial atomic charges one can use since they are not a physical observable. However, the so-called electrostatic potential-fitted (ESP) charges are the most accurate in computing the electrostatic energy of a chemical system in classical atomistic simulations. These ESP charges are derived from a density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the system and fit such that the electrostatic potential due to the point charges best reproduces the electrostatic potential from the DFT calculation on a set of grid points surrounding the atoms in the system. For simulations of molecular systems, ESP charges have been used for decades, with the RESP
11
,
12
and CHELPG
13
methods being particularly popular. The REPEAT method
14
was the first ESP charge method that could derive charges from periodic DFT calculations. Later, Manz and Sholl developed another ESP based method, called the DDEC method
15
, that is popular for atomistic simulations of MOFs. While ESP charges are considered accurate in that they reproduce the DFT-derived electrostatic potential, they require a compute-intensive first principles DFT calculation to be performed on the system. For MOFs containing thousands of atoms in the unit cell, a periodic DFT calculation can take hundreds of CPU hours, which is not practical when screening large MOF databases containing tens of thousands of structures or more. To overcome this bottleneck, rapid empirical methods based on physical charge-sharing models were first employed to compute the atomic charges in high throughput screening studies
16
,
17
. The most popular of these methods are the charge equilibration (QEq) method
18
and the more generalized split charge equilibration (SQE) method
19
both of whose charges heavily depend on the parameterization. Kadantsev et al. developed a popular MOF-optimized parameterization of the QEq method called MEPO-QEq
20
that was fit to reproduce REPEAT charges trained on a set of 543 hMOFs. This set of hMOFs included 4 common metallic nodes, 52 different organic linkers, 17 different functional groups and 11 atom types. Collins et al. later developed a MOF-optimized parameterization for the SQE method, called SQE-MEPO
21
. With a diverse training set of 559 hMOFs and 45 hypothetical porous polymer networks (PPNs) and a separate test set of 520 MOFs and 65 PPNs, a total of 91 parameters were optimized for 17 elements and 31 bond types. Due to the limitations in the physical models, the charge equilibration methods may produce distributions of charges that can differ significantly from the ESP charges, particularly for some metal elements
21
.
Machine learning (ML) models have become increasingly popular for predicting compute-intensive chemical properties, including models specifically for predicting ESP charges
22
,
23
,
24
. In general, these ML models are trained to map descriptors that encode an atom’s chemical environment in a structure to its corresponding ESP charge. For predicting partial atomic charges in MOFs, several ML models have been developed that can predict charges for all atoms in a system in seconds while showing much better agreement with the reference DFT-derived ESP charges than empirical charges
25
,
26
,
27
. Curating or selecting datasets for training is usually the first step in developing ML models. Here, the Computation-Ready, Experimental (CoRE) databases
28
,
29
have been exclusively used for developing machine learning models for predicting partial atomic charges in MOFs. The CoRE databases are collections of experimentally characterized MOF structures taken from the Cambridge Structure Database (CSD)
30
that have been prepared for use in computational simulations. The first version of the CoRE database
28
was published in 2014 and contained close to 4.7 K structures, while an updated version
29
published in 2019 contains over 16 K MOF structures.
Using different subsets of the CoRE databases, researchers have built ML models for predicting partial atomic charges in MOFs using various atomic descriptors and ML architectures. Korolev et al.
25
trained a gradient boosting decision tree regressor (GBDTR) for predicting charges in MOFs using DDEC charges computed for 2,932 MOFs from the CoRE 2014 database. This model used a collection of atomic descriptors, including (i) intrinsic elemental properties of the atom (e.g., atomic number, covalent radius, and electronegativity), (ii) structural descriptors of the atom, (e.g., coordination number and Voronoi fingerprints), as well as (iii) distance-based descriptors (e.g., atom-centered symmetry functions, ACSFs
31
, and AGNI fingerprints
32
). Korolev et al. reported a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.010 e compared to the reference DDEC charges from their test set. Using DDEC charges computed on 2,974 MOFs from the CoRE 2019 database, Kancharlapalli et al.
26
developed a random forest regressor (RFR) to predict partial atomic charges in MOFs. They used a set of descriptors consisting of two elemental properties (electronegativity and first ionization energy) and five connectivity-based descriptors based on chemical bonding: coordination number, average bond distance, average electronegativity of the neighboring bonded atoms, and average first ionization energies in the first and second coordination shells. Kancharlapalli et al. reported an MAE of 0.019 e on their test set.
Both GBDTR and RFR methods described above are decision tree-based models that learn chemical bonding information via structural descriptors. These models are only aware of chemical environments of discrete atoms during training and inference. Graph neural networks (GNNs), on the other hand, can learn chemical bonding information for each atom directly from the chemical graph. Molecules and periodic materials can be abstracted to chemical graphs by encoding the atoms as nodes and the bonds as edges, where additional descriptors can be assigned to the nodes (e.g., atomic number and electronegativity) and edges (e.g., bond length and bond order). Raza et al.
27
trained a gated graph neural network (GGNN) to predict DDEC charges in MOFs, with only atomic numbers assigned to the nodes of the graph. The “message passing” mechanism in the GGNN exchanges the hidden embeddings of the atoms across the chemical bonds in each layer of the GGNN, therefore allowing the model to incorporate information on the atom of interest as well as the bonded atoms during training and inference. Raza et al. used DDEC charges from 2266 MOFs from the CoRE 2014 database for developing their GGNN model and reported an MAE of 0.025 e on their test set.
All three abovementioned ML models achieved test set MAEs of 0.025 e or better against the reference DDEC charges, which is a significant improvement upon the empirical charge generation methods, whose MAEs are usually on the order of 0.1 e. These works have clearly demonstrated the algorithmic advantages of ML models over the physical charge-sharing models (QEq, SQE, etc.). However, in all three studies, less than 3000 MOFs were used to develop the ML models and a detailed diversity analysis of the SBU chemistry was not performed on the training sets. Moreover, there have been progressively more reports pointing out the existence of severe structural errors in the CoRE databases
33
,
34
,
35
. Most alarmingly, a recent manual inspection of the CoRE databases has shown that almost 50% of the structures in these databases have structural errors, such as missing protons, or incorrectly assigned framework charges
34
. Nearly all of these structural errors are manifested in metal oxidation state assignments that are either impossible, never before observed or extremely rare in stable compounds. Such erroneous structures are analogous to molecules containing hexavalent carbon atoms in a drug candidate database – they are not chemically sensible and therefore not synthetically accessible. Indeed, a manual inspection of all structures in the datasets used to develop the three previously mentioned ML charge models reveals that they still contain 16% to 22% erroneous MOF structures. With such severe structural errors likely making up significant portions of the relatively small training sets used to develop the three ML partial charge models for MOFs, the fidelity and transferability of these models may be questioned.
In this work, we present an ML charge prediction model for MOFs that attempts to address the shortcomings of previous ML charge models, which we refer to as the MEPO-ML (Mof Electrostatic POtential-Machine Learned) model. The MEPO-ML model was developed with the ARC-MOF database
9
that contains 279,632 MOFs for which DFT-derived REPEAT charges have been calculated. This database contains approximately two orders of magnitude more MOF structures than the datasets used to develop previous models, which translates to much more diverse atomic environments for ML models to learn from. Moreover, the ARC-MOF database was screened for the kind of structural errors found in the CoRE databases; we estimate that the structural error rate in ARC-MOF is less than 5% compared to ~50% found in CoRE. In terms of the ML architecture, MEPO-ML was developed with a more advanced graph attention network (GAT). The GAT architecture adds an “attention mechanism” to a generic message passing graph-neutral network, such that the model also learns to weigh the messages from different neighboring nodes. This is analogous to the concept of electronegativity in chemistry, where the fluorine atom would attract more electrons compared to the hydrogen atom in an F-C-H fragment. Therefore “messages” from the fluorine atom would have more “weight” (or get more “attention”) than from the hydrogen atom when passing messages to the carbon. Our GAT-based MEPO-ML model is compared to RFR, GBDTR and GGNN models for charge predictions using the same training and test sets. This is important since it was difficult to compare to previously reported models since different datasets were used in developing each model. We also analyze the descriptor importance and the effects of training set size for each model. Gas adsorption properties from atomistic simulations using MEPO-ML charges are compared against those using the reference DFT-derived REPEAT charges and the empirical SQE-MEPO charges. Lastly, we also benchmark the inference speed of our MEPO-ML model in our charge prediction workflow.
Results
Datasets
The 279,632 MOFs of the ARC-MOF database were split into a training, development and test set in a 80:10:10 ratio. Normally, this would be done by random splitting, however, as shown in Fig.
1a
, the population of elements in the ARC-MOF database varies by several orders of magnitude. For example, there are more than 20 million carbon atoms in the entire database whereas there are only 28 niobium atoms. To avoid the exclusion of certain elements by random splitting due to their rarity, a custom splitting scheme was used as described in the Methods section. Figure
1b–d
presents the atom counts in the training, development and test sets for selected elements – including the top 8 most abundant elements as well as the top 8 most rare elements. The figures demonstrates that the custom splitting procedure was able to split the whole database into subsets where the atom count by element was maintained in an 80:10:10 ratio for abundant elements (e.g. C, H, O, N, Zn, Cu, F and Cl in Fig.
1b
–
d
). Although the ~40 million atoms could have been individually split into the three sets, it is important to note that in this work, all atoms in a given MOF are put into the same dataset. Thus, for rare elements, such as Nb, W, Th, Yb, and Ge in Fig.
1
, the splitting ratio diverges from the target 80:10:10 due to the varying number of atoms in the unit cells of the MOFs containing these elements. For elements of extreme rarity (Rh, Pu, Te), where there are less than 2 MOFs containing these elements in the whole dataset, we prioritized their inclusion in the test or development set, since we are interested in the model’s transferability to elements that are absent in the training set. The exact splits of the datasets used for this work are given Supplementary Table

Performance of the ML Models
Figure

illustrates the ML architecture of the graph attention network (GAT) employed by the MEPO-ML model developed in this work (see details in Methods). In Fig.
3
, we compare the ML charge models to the physical charge-sharing SQE-MEPO model that was parameterized to replicate REPEAT charges. Parity plots comparing the reference REPEAT charges to the predicted charges are given in Fig.

3e
for the random forest regressor (RFR), Fig.
3f
for the gradient boosted decision tree regressor (GBDTR) and Fig.
3g
for the gated graph neural network (GGNN) model. The ML models have Pearson
R
2
’s of 0.97 or greater and the parity plots all look qualitatively similar. On the other hand, the parity plot with the SQE-MEPO method is drastically different with the model having an R
2
of only 0.75. Similarly, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the predicted charges in the test set for the SQE-MEPO model is 0.186 e, which is at least 4 times higher than the ML models which have MAEs of 0.043 e or less. To further compare the ML models to the physical charge sharing SQE-MEPO model, we examine the distribution of charges. Figure
3b
shows a violin plot comparing the charge distributions of REPEAT charges to the distribution of SQE-MEPO charges for the 18 most abundant elements in the test set. The charge distributions of the SQE-MEPO model are strikingly narrow compared to the REPEAT charge distributions which have a much larger variation for all elements shown. The plot clearly highlights the limited capability of the SQE-MEPO method for generating varied charges in different chemical environments. Figure
3d
shows the same distribution comparison but for the GAT (MEPO-ML) model where it is fair to say that the GAT charge distributions are near mirror images of the REPEAT charge distributions. Note that the GAT charges after charge neuralization were used to plot Fig.
3d
; the same plot using the GAT raw predicted charges can be found in Supplementary Note

Next, we compare the performances of the four ML models against one another, where it is important to note that all models use the same descriptors and a thorough hyperparameter search was performed on each. The MAEs of the charges in the test set range from 0.043 to 0.025 e with the performance of the models having the same ranking as the ML model complexity. More specifically, the least sophisticated decision tree models, the RFR and GBTR have MAEs of 0.043 and 0.037 e, respectively. The RFR model is an ensemble of decision trees whereas the GBTR method improves over the RFR model by iteratively growing more trees to reduce the prediction residuals. The RFR and GBDTR methods only predict the charge based on the descriptors of the atom of interest (including those that describe the atom’s local environment), while the graph neutral networks additionally enable information transfer between chemically bonded atoms via edges encoded in the graphs, thereby giving better predictions. The GGNN gives an MAE of 0.032 e, while the more sophisticated GAT model possesses the best MAE of 0.025 e. It should be noted that previous ML models for predicting the DDEC partial atomic charges reported MAEs of 0.025 e or better. However, it is important to note that the test set used here is completely different than those used in the previous works
25
,
26
,
27
and therefore the performance metrics are not directly comparable.
In addition to evaluating the performance based on each individual atom-based metrics, the prediction errors of each model were also evaluated at the per MOF level using the relative standard deviations (RSD) as proposed by Liu and Luan
36
. The RSD value represents the normalized error of the charge predictions for all atoms in a single MOF, thus, the lower the better. RSD values were computed for all MOFs in our test set for all four ML methods and plotted as histograms in Fig.
4
(with the SQE-MEPO model also given). The trend in the histograms for the ML methods follows the trends as the individual charge based MAEs. Therefore, the GAT model is again shown to be the best performing model for predicting atomic partial charges in MOFs.

Charge neutrality
Since the ML models are unaware of the total framework charge of the MOFs during training or inference, there is no guarantee that the charges on the atoms will sum to the net charge of the framework, which in this case is zero for all MOFs in the ARC-MOF database. This excess charge must be neutralized, and there are various schemes for achieving this that have been proposed in the literature
23
,
27
,
37
,
38
. The simplest method involves evenly distributing the excess charge across all atomic charges, while more sophisticated methods have been proposed where the excess charge is distributed across the atoms based on a certain error metric. In this work, excess charges are simply evenly distributed across all atoms in a MOF to enforce charge neutrality. The work of Raza et al.
27
showed that distributing excess charges evenly or based on standard deviations yielded very similar MAE performances for their GGNN model. Moreover, if a model can predict atomic charges very accurately, the amount of excess charge that needs to be distributed would be minimal and therefore the method of the distribution should not be too consequential. To verify this claim, we computed the average charge corrections on the test set for the ML models, listed in Table
1
alongside the MAEs. Note that the “charge corrections” we discuss here are the absolute values of the charges being corrected during the charge neutralization process for each atom. For the RFR and GBDTR models, the average charge corrections are 0.0045 and 0.0026 e, respectively, which is around an order of magnitude smaller than the MAEs of their respective models. This suggested that the performance of the model would not be significantly affected by the charge neuralization scheme. However, this is not the case for GNN models, where GGNN and GAT charges are on average corrected with 0.175 and 0.026 e, respectively. This is likely due to the charge neutrality scheme (Eq.
11
) being implemented as part of our GNN models (noted with “in-model charge neutrality” in Table
1
). This leads to the GNN models minimizing the loss between the “corrected charges” and the REPEAT charges, instead of the loss between the “raw predicted charges” and the REPEAT charges. When we move the charge neutrality scheme outside the GNN model (i.e. the charges are neutralized after the model inference) and re-train the GNN models, the average charge corrections (noted with “out-of-model charge neutrality” in Table
1
) were reduced to 0.0023 e and 0.0024 e for the GGNN and GAT models, respectively; however, as the MAEs of these models are mostly the same, it suggested that whether the charge neutralization scheme is implemented as part of the model does not significantly impact on the overall performance of the GNN models. We note that only “out-of-model charge neutrality” is possible for the decision tree-based models since inference on these models are based on discrete atoms instead of all atoms in the MOF structure. Thus, this investigation suggests that using the even distribution strategy for charge neutrality is reasonable for these ML models and would not introduce any significant errors.

Feature importance for each model
In this work, 226 descriptors or features are computed for each atom in the database, including 8 atomic properties, 144 shell descriptors and 70 radial function descriptors and 52 angular function descriptors (see details in Methods). One common way for interpreting the models is to compute the feature importance. For the RFR and GBDTR models, the feature importances can be computed from the mean decrease in impurity (or the Gini importance) of the individual decision trees. For explaining the importance of node features in the GNNs, the GNNExplainer
39
,
40
provided in the Pytorch Geometric library
41
is used. It works by determining the variation in prediction accuracy when the certain node features are masked, the larger this variation the more important the masked node features; the feature importance scores are determined for each node, therefore the same feature can have different importance scores on different nodes within the same graph. As such, the reported feature importance is the average of the feature importance scores over all nodes in our test set. Feature importance values are normalized such that they sum to 1 for each model. The top 10 most important features and their feature importance values are plotted in Fig.
5
; feature importance values for all features are given in Supplementary Table
E2
as a separate spreadsheet. Note that since different methods were used to compute the feature importance, one should not compare them quantitatively, however, a few interesting points can still be made.

The feature importance plots for the RFR and GBDTR models revealed that the coordination shell descriptors (
\({{Shell}}_{P}^{n,m}\)
in Fig.
5
) and the atomic properties are the most important descriptors. Both models are not directly aware of the chemical information about the bonded atoms when predicting for an atom of interest, therefore it relies on the covalent shell descriptors to obtain the chemical bonding information. This suggested that the chemical information of bonded atoms is essential for predicting atomic partial charges. Coincidentally, the top 3 most important features in the RFR model match exactly with Kancharlapalli et al.’s work; only 5 descriptors were used for training the RFR model in Kancharlapalli et al.’s work, and the average electronegativity in the first covalent shell, the ionization energy, and the electronegativity were identified as the top 3 most important features
26
. Even though many more features are used in this work, our RFR model still identifies these 3 features as the most important ones.
For the GNN models (i.e., GAT and GGNN), the chemical bonds are encoded as edges in the graphs, and the “message passing” mechanism passes chemical information across the edges via graph convolutions. That is, the essential chemical information of bonded atoms is natively accessible in the GNNs, therefore, the covalent shell descriptors become less important in these models. The ACSF descriptors become dominant in both GNN models, since these descriptors capture 3D through-space environments of an atom, which is not accessible via a chemical graph. However, note that the range of the plots for the GAT and GGNN in Fig.
5
is much smaller than the other plots; in fact, all feature importance are with 0.0040 to 0.0055 for the GNN models, indicating the features are similar in importance for the GNN models.
In the GAT model presented above, bond distances were not encoded as edge features in the graphs for MOFs. One might think that the GNN models could learn the same information from the bond distances as from the 3D coordinate based descriptors (e.g., pwRDFs, ACSFs). However, when training a GAT model from graphs with bond distances as edge features but only atomic identities as node features, the MAE of this model drops significantly to 0.0344 e from 0.0247 e. Additionally, when training a GAT model from graphs that uses both the full descriptor set as node features and bond distances as edge features, only minimal improvement was observed (MAE = 0.0245 e vs 0.0247 e).
On the other hand, with the notion that using too many descriptors in an ML model that are, either not correlated to the properties of interest or that are strongly correlated to one another, may add noise and lower the performance of the models, we examine models trained with reduced feature sets. We first analyzed the covariance matrix of the full feature set of 226 features to examine how the descriptors are correlated; when we removed features that have an absolute covariance coefficient of >0.85 with another feature, we are left with 114 features. When we trained RFR, GBDTR, GGNN, and GAT models with this reduced feature set, the test set MAEs are almost equal to, but slightly worse than the models built with the full feature set was used. One may have expected an improvement using this reduced feature set for the RFR model because the top three most important features (Fig.
5a
) already account for 70% of the feature importance for the model. However, the MAE of the RFR model trained with the reduced feature set is 0.0457 e compared to 0.0432 e when trained with the full feature set. For the graph neural network models, GGNN and GAT, the reduced feature set was trimmed down even further to exclude the coordination shell descriptors, since these features should be able to be learned from the message passing within the graph. However, the performance of the models with the reduced feature sets was again slightly worse than with the full feature set. For example, the GAT trained with the reduced feature set is 0.0251 e compared to 0.0247 e when trained with the full feature set.
We also tried a reduced feature set using a principle-component analysis. We found that 99% of the variance was recovered with only 64 principal components. RFR, GBDTR, GGNN, and GAT models were rebuilt with these 64 principle-components as features, but again we found that all models performed slightly worse than their full feature set counterparts. Detailed results for both feature selection analyses are given in Supplementary Note

Predictions on out-of-distribution geometries
During the curation of the ARC-MOF database, the MOF structures were taken as is from the original experimental and hypothetical MOF databases without additional structural optimizations. Thus, MEPO-ML was trained on a mix of experimental structures from single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments and computer-generated MOFs taken from various publicly available databases. The hypothetical MOFs were constructed using different assembly methods, in which the geometries were optimized to varying extents using different force field methods. Since MEPO-ML was trained on a variety of equilibrium geometries, one should be able to apply MEPO-ML on any reasonable equilibrium geometry, as is the case with most charge generation models. To study this, we have examined how MEPO-ML performs on “out-of-distribution” geometries where the MOF framework is deformed from the equilibrium via a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD simulations are also a common use case where one may want to apply a rapid charge generation model.
A constant volume DFT-MD simulation of the MOF CALF-20 was performed using a stochastic Anderson thermostat at 300 K for 14 ps (detailed in Methods). Both REPEAT and MEPO-ML partial atomic charges were computed for configurations that were sampled every 0.05 ps from the MD simulation. Figure
6a
presents the charge prediction MAE of each sampled MD configuration during the 14 ps simulation. The average MAE for all 280 MD configurations is 0.067 e. Although this is more than double the MAE of 0.025 e reported for the “equilibrium” test set structures, it is important to realize that CALF-20 is not part of the MEPO-ML training set and the charge prediction MAE of the equilibrium experimental CALF-20 structure is 0.046 e. Thus, MEPO-ML charge predictions are still reasonable for these out-of-distribution geometries. In fact, the prediction MAE with MEPO-ML for these distorted structures are still better than the best QEq charge models when those models are applied to equilibrium structures.

When examining the MD configurations with the large charge prediction errors, it was discovered that one or more of the Zn-O bonds had broken compared to the equilibrium structure. Figure
6b
shows the structure with the largest MAE in red compared to the experimental equilibrium structure in blue, where the broken Zn-O bond is highlighted with an orange dashed ellipse. Examination of all 280 configurations revealed that 148 of them possessed broken Zn-O bonds. It is important to realize that geometries with broken bonds were also missing the corresponding edges in their graphs for MEPO-ML charge predictions. This might result in less accurate charge predictions for these geometries since the attention mechanism relies on message passing across chemical bonds, and a “missing edge” would lead to the GAT model interpreting it as a “different MOF”. At the same time, if the Zn-O bond is broken, it might be better to “interpret” it as a different MOF. To examine this, we recomputed the MEPO-ML charges for all 280 configurations but using the same bond table from the equilibrium structure for their graphs (i.e., no broken bonds); this only resulted in a slightly better average MAE of 0.065 e as compared to 0.067 e. This suggests that the MEPO-ML model is able to predict reasonable charges even when the graph structure is changed by geometric distortions.
One question of interest when applying MEPO-ML to an MD simulation is whether recomputing the MEPO-ML charges for each MD configuration gives a better charge prediction when compared to simply using the same MEPO-ML charges computed from the equilibrium geometry. If one fixes the charges to the MEPO-ML charges from the equilibrium structure for each step of the MD simulation, the average MAE compared to DFT-derived charges is 0.080 e. This compares to the average MAE of 0.067 if MEPO-ML charges are recomputed for every step. This result further suggests that MEPO-ML can provide reasonable charge predictions for out-of-distribution geometries.
Effect of data quantity for training
The three previously reported ML models for predicting partial atomic charge predictions in MOFs used datasets of less than 3000 MOFs from the CoRE databases
25
,
26
,
27
. In this work, the total training set consisted of over 200,000 MOFs. To examine the difference in performance when using training sets of smaller sizes with the various models, 5 smaller training sets were extracted from the total training set used in this work. The first training set is the subset of 5565 CoRE MOFs in the total training set. This set is roughly equivalent to the datasets used to train previous ML models. Starting from the second dataset, additional MOF were sampled from the total training set and added to the first set to create the new datasets of increasing size. Rather than randomly choosing additional MOFs, we wanted to create diverse training sets. To do this, we used revised autocorrelation function (RAC) descriptors for MOFs developed by Moosavi et al.
42
to characterize the metal nodes and organic linker (20 RAC descriptors for each) of the MOFs in the total training set. We then used furthest point sampling of MOFs based on their RAC descriptors to add an additional 5000/10,000/50,000/100,000 MOFs to the first dataset to create the 2
nd
/3
rd
/4
th
/5
th
training sets, respectively. More details about the RAC descriptors and the sampling are discussed in Supplementary Note
3
. We then trained the RFR, GBDTR, GGNN, and GAT models using these 5 training sets and tested them on the original test set of 27,996 MOFs. Plots of the charge MAEs of the four models trained on the datasets of increasing size are given in Fig.
7
, where it is important to note that the same test set was used in all cases. The general trend for all models follows the intuition that more training data results in better prediction performance. Furthermore, notice that the two GNN models always outperform the RFR and GBDTR models with the same training set size, suggesting algorithmic advantages of the GNNs for both small and large training sets. Of the two GNNs, it is interesting to note that the GGNN outperforms the GAT with the smallest training set. However, the GAT model continues to improve with increasing training set size whereas the performance of the GGNN appears to level off after a training set size of ~50 K. The data point for the GAT model with the largest sized training data corresponds to the MEPO-ML model. The trend line for the GAT model given in Fig.
7
suggests that the MEPO-ML model can be further improved with more training data.

Analysis of anomalous MEPO-ML charges
Here we investigate cases where the MEPO-ML charges deviate significantly from the REPEAT charges in the test set. We first examined MOFs in the test set which contained atoms where the MEPO-ML charge differed from the REPEAT charge by more than 1.0 e; there were 45 such MOFs. For 24 of these MOFs, we found that there were errors in processing the REPEAT charges that were fit from the DFT calculations. With more than 270 K MOFs in the dataset, it is perhaps not surprising that the high throughput workflow used to process the charges observed some such errors. When the REPEAT charges are corrected, the MAE between the MEPO-ML and REPEAT charges in these 24 MOFs drops to 0.020 e from the 0.271 e observed prior to correction.
For the remainder of the 21 MOFs with charges differing by more than 1.0 e, we examined the structures in detail. 10 of the 21 structures contained obvious structural errors such as missing protons, disordered atoms, or missing counterions—the latter of which means that the DFT calculation was performed on a neutral framework, whereas the true framework has a net charge. The remaining 11 structures possessed unusual geometric features such as non-linear alkyne moieties, distorted aromatic rings, or potentially undercoordinated metal atoms. Five of the MOFs with unusual geometries originated from the Boyd-Woo hypothetical MOF database
7
, in which case the distortions were likely an artifact of the geometry optimization that was performed at the force field level. A detailed account of the structural errors or unusual structural features found in the 21 MOFs is provided in Supplementary Note
4
.
Next, we examine partial charges for elements that are absent in the training set – specifically Pu, Rh and Te (see Fig.
1b
). In each case, the test set contains only a single experimental MOF with the rare element and each MOF contains only a single symmetry equivalent site for that element. Table
2
gives the REPEAT and MEPO-ML predicted charges for the element in the test set, along with the RSD value for the whole MOF. The worst performing charge is for the Te atom in the experimental MOF DB12-OROJEM_freeONLY, where the REPEAT charge is 1.816 e while MEPO-ML predicted it as 0.972 e – a difference of 0.844 e. We note that the Te atom is part of the [TeMo
6
O
24
]
6−
polyoxoanion and is coordinated to 6 highly electronegative oxygen atoms, which likely accounts for the large, positive REPEAT charge. Additionally, we don’t expect too many similar polyoxoanion moieties in ARC-MOF since they are not contained in any SBU libraries (that we are aware of) for building hypothetical MOFs, and ARC-MOF is composed of ~97% hypothetical MOFs. Thus, the model may not be able to predict charges well for atoms in such environments.
Table 2 Comparison of REPEAT and MEPO-ML charges for elements not in the training set
Full size table
For the Rh-containing MOF DB12-TERFUT_freeONLY, the REPEAT charge was 0.416 e while the MEPO-ML model predicted to be −0.053 e. Here we note that the Rh center in DB12-TERFUT_freeONLY is highly under-coordinated with a rare coordination number of 2 and non-linear geometry. Finally, for Pu, there is a 0.14 e difference in the REPEAT and MEPO-ML charges. Although this difference is significantly better than for Rh and Te cases, it is still significantly higher than the MAD of 0.025 e observed for all atoms in the test set. We note that for all three MOFs given in Table
2
the RSD, which quantifies the charge deviations for the whole MOF, are all >0.15 e, comparing to an average RSD of 0.03 e for all MOFs in the test set. Thus, as one might expect, MEPO-ML does not perform well for MOFs containing elements not seen in the training set.
Gas adsorption simulations
To examine the effects of different charge assignment schemes in evaluating physical properties, the adsorption properties of various gases were computed with atomistic GCMC simulations on the test set of 27,996 MOFs. First, we evaluate the CO

selectivities for MOFs in our test set using MEPO-ML charges and SQE-MEPO charges compared to the results using DFT-derived REPEAT charges. The MEPO-ML charges perform exceptionally well for the CO
2
uptakes where the mean absolute deviation (MAD) compared to the REPEAT model is only 0.059 mmol/g. This compares to the MAD of 0.206 mmol/g with the SQE-MEPO model, which is over three times larger. The CO
2
/N
2
selectivity shows a similar performance gap between the two models, with the MEPO-ML model giving a MAD of 3.06, which is 2.5 times smaller than the MAD of 7.52 for the SQE-MEPO model. We note that there are some expected deviations between the results using REPEAT charges and the other charge models due to the finite sampling and stochastic nature of the GCMC simulations, particularly when the uptake is very low.

To further demonstrate the importance of accurate charges in gas adsorption simulations, we examine the adsorption properties with a polar gas at both low and high pressure. For this we examined the H
2
S uptake at 1 bar and 10 mbar, where the latter pressure is relevant for biogas applications
43
. Fig.
9
shows parity plots of the H
2
S uptake capacity computed using MEPO-ML and SQE-MEPO charges compared to those computed with REPEAT charges. At 1 bar, the MEPO-ML model has an MAD in the H
2
S uptake of 0.25 mmol/g which is almost five times better than the MAD of 1.23 mmol/g of the SQE-MEPO model. At 10 mbar, the MAD is 0.028 mmol/g for the MEPO-ML model and 0.079 mmol/g for the SQE-MEPO model, which is only about 3 times better. While the performance gap seems to be reduced at low pressure when examining the MADs, it is important to note that the uptakes are much lower at 10 mbar such that the absolute errors are smaller than at higher pressure. Examination of the parity plot of the SQE-MEPO model, given in Fig.
9d
, shows the SQE-MEPO model systematically under-predicts the uptake. This is reflected in the Pearson R
2
of the SQE-MEPO model, which is rather poor at 0.24. In comparison, the R
2
is still quite high at 0.90 for the MEPO-ML model. For predicting the uptake of a polar gas where electrostatic interactions are expected to play an important role, the more accurate MEPO-ML model significantly outperforms the SQE-MEPO model at both high and low pressure.

Rapid charge generation schemes are often used for high throughput screening of materials, where the recovery of top performers is important. As such, we examined how well the MEPO-ML and SQE-MEPO models recover the top 300 MOFs (c.a. top 1%) from our test set of 27,996 MOF structures screened with the DFT-derived REPEAT charges. Table

capture, is only able to recover less than half of the higher performing materials for H
2
S adsorption at 1 bar and less than 20% at 10 mbar. Presumably the performance gap between the models is greater for H

S uptake because the more polar nature of the guest makes the results more sensitive to the partial atomic charges used.

Deployment of MEPO-ML
A charge assignment code for using our pre-trained MEPO-ML model is written in Python and provided on our GitHub repository for public usage. The charge assignment code takes a MOF structure in the CIF format as input and writes a new CIF file with predicted charges embedded in the file. The code can generate charges rapidly even with a single CPU core. Figure
10
shows the wall-clock times per MOF on a consumer grade desktop computer (with an AMD 5900X CPU and Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU) for generating the charges on the entire test set MOFs (~28 K structures); only one CPU core is used for this benchmark. Aside from the total charge assignment time, the benchmark also records times required to (a) generate the bond connection table required to construct the graph, (b) compute the descriptors, and (c) compute the charges from the GAT model inference. The bond table construction is by far the most time-consuming part of the calculation (orange contents in Fig.
10
), where we used the Isayev nearest neighbor algorithm
44
implemented in the Pymatgen library
45
. For MOFs with a very large unit cell (over 1400 atoms), the bond table construction alone can take over a minute. However, it should be noted that over 80% of the MOFs in the ARC-MOF database have less than 200 atoms in the unit cell. Therefore, in most cases, our code can generate partial atomic charge embedded CIF files within 2 seconds with a single CPU core. For the final charge prediction step, the GAT model inference times using both CPU (blue) and GPU (green) are plotted in Fig.
10
. While using the GPU gives much faster charge prediction times, it only takes less than 0.4 s when using the CPU. We also tested our charge assignment code in a parallel workflow for simultaneous charge assignment on multiple MOFs across all 12 cores (24 threads) on the AMD 5900X CPU in our benchmark computer. Charge assignments on all entries of our test set (27,996 MOFs) finished within 3 h—this is less than 0.4 seconds per MOF on average. This suggest our charge assignment would also be suitable for high-throughput tasks on systems with high CPU core counts.

Discussion
In this work, we presented the MEPO-ML model based on the graph attention network (GAT) ML architecture for generating fast and accurate partial atomic charges for MOFs. With a GAT model, the MOF structure is converted into a graph with atoms as nodes and bonds as edges, where descriptors with chemical environment information are encoded as node and edge features. The MEPO-ML model was trained and tested with the ARC-MOF database containing ~279 K MOF structures and over 40 million DFT-derived REPEAT partial atomic charges. Previous ML models used to predict partial atomic charges in MOFs used datasets containing less than 3 K MOFs that likely possess large structural error rates
34
.
We compare our MEPO-ML model against other ML architectures used in the literature for predicting partial atomic charges in MOFs, namely a random forest regressor (RFR), a gradient boosted decision tree regressor (GBDTR) and a gated graph neural network (GGNN). For partial atomic charge predictions, the GAT-based MEPO-ML model outperformed these 3 other ML models, with an MAE of 0.025 e and an
R
2
of 0.99 against the DFT-derived charges, using the same training set and descriptor sets. Additionally, results from training the models with various training set sizes suggests that accuracy of the MEPO-ML model can be further improved with even more training data. We also compare the MEPO-ML model to the empirical SQE-MEPO model for both charge predictions as well as gas adsorption performance via GCMC simulations. When evaluating on the same test set, the SQE-MEPO method has an MAE in the predicted charges of 0.186 e, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than MEPO-ML’s MAE. When evaluating gas-adsorption properties, we find that the results using MEPO-ML charges are in much better agreement with those determined with the DFT-derived charges as compared to those using SQE charges. For example, for evaluating H
2
S uptakes at 10 mbar, the Pearson R
2
for MEPO-ML was 0.90 and whereas for SQE-MEPO it was only 0.24. Furthermore, MEPO-ML was able to recover 238 of the top 300 performing MOFs from the H
2
S screening at 10 mbar with the reference REPEAT charges whereas SQE-MEPO was only able to recover 57 of them.
With such drastic improvements in both the predicted charges and computed adsorption properties using the charges, we recommend that MEPO-ML charges replace the use of empirical methods charge sharing models, such as QEq or SQE, in high-throughput virtual screening workflows.
Methods
Dataset preparation
The ARC-MOF database
9
contains 279,632 MOFs with over 40 million DFT-derived REPEAT partial atomic charges labeled for every atom in the unit cell of each MOF. We note that the structures in ARC-MOF were screened for structural errors based on our in-house code that computes the metal oxidation states of all metal atoms for the structure as given. If any metal oxidation state in a structure is found to be impossible, unknown or extremely rare, the structure is flagged as having an error. The method was validated on over 16 K structures from the CoRE 2019 database that were all manually inspected for structural errors by comparing the structure to that described in the original publication. If a structure was flagged as having an error, it was found to contain an error 95% of the time based on our manual validation. Like all electrostatic potential fitting charge methods, the REPEAT method can be prone to the so-called buried atom problem, which can result in “unphysically” large charges. MOF structures with unusually large charges that may result from problems with the electronic structure, processing errors, or buried atoms were removed during the curation of ARC-MOF. Further details of the curation process of the ARC-MOF database were discussed in the original publication
9
.
The database was split into training, development and test sets in an 80:10:10 ratio. As discuss in the Results, since the population of elements in the ARC-MOF database varies by several orders of magnitude (see Fig.
1a
), random splitting is likely to arbitrarily bias or exclude certain elements from the splits. Therefore, MOF structures were split such that the fraction of each element observed in each split roughly maintains the 80:10:10 ratio. To achieve this, the atom counts of each element contained in each MOF was determined. Then 10 bins were created to replicate the 80:10:10 split where 8 bins belonged to the training set and 1 bin each belonged to the development and test sets. Starting from the least common element, all MOFs containing this element were randomized and put into each bin sequentially as to populate each bin evenly with MOFs. Then the procedure was repeated for the next least common element until all 279 K MOFs were placed into one of the 10 bins. All MOFs in the first 8 bins were combined as the training set, while the MOFs in the last two bins made up the development and test sets, respectively. The percentages of the resulting splits are illustrated in Fig.
1b–d
.
Graph construction
MOF structures stored in the crystallographic information file (CIF) format need to be converted to graphs as the input for a graph neural network (GNN). For MOFs, nodes in a graph are simply the atoms in the unit cell of the MOF, while the edges connecting the nodes represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Chemical bonds, including those across the periodic boundary, are found using the Isayev nearest neighbor algorithm
44
implemented in the Pymatgen library
45
, where two atoms are considered bonded if (i) they share a Voronoi facet and (ii) the bond distance is less than the sum of the Cordero covalent radii, plus 0.5 Å. By default, the algorithm uses a radial tolerance of 0.25 Å for the sum of covalent radii, however, we noticed that this default tolerance often fails to capture bonds between metal atoms and carboxylates, which is a common bond-type in MOFs. In some cases, this results in isolated nodes or disconnected graph components when encoding the graphs for MOFs. Therefore, we opted to increase the tolerance to 0.5 Å in this work. After constructing all graphs with the 0.5 Å tolerance, for all MOFs in our dataset, no isolated nodes were found using PyTorch Geometric’s “
has_isolated_nodes
” function
41
and only one graph component for each MOF was found using NetworkX’s “
connected_components
” function
46
, i.e., all nodes are connected as a single graph for all MOFs in our dataset.
Atomic descriptors
The chemical environments of an atom in a chemical system can be encoded into numeric vectors with physical properties of atoms and values calculated from descriptor functions. For ML models that take tabulated data as inputs, such as decision tree models, these atomic descriptors are directly used as the inputs. For graph neural networks, atomic descriptors are provided as node features in the chemical graph. In this work, eight atomic properties are chosen to describe each atom’s elemental identity: the atomic number, the atomic weight, the van der Waals radius, the first ionization energy, the Cerdero covalent radius, the Rahm atomic radius
47
, the static dipole polarizability
48
as well as the Ghosh electronegativity
49
. These specific properties are selected because they have entries for all 74 elements in the ARC-MOF database and were readily available from the Mendeleev Python library

. Since the graph representation of a MOF only captures the bonding relationships among the atoms, descriptors that capture an atom’s radial and angular local environments are also added to the node feature vector. Four types of descriptors are used in this work: the atomic property weighted distribution functions, the weighted average atomic properties, the weighted atom-centered symmetry functions and the coordination shell descriptors.
The atomic property weighted radial distribution functions (
pwRDFs
) were developed by Woo and coworkers to describe the chemical and geometric features of an entire MOF structure for gas adsorption property predictions
51
. For this work, the formulation of
pwRDF
is modified to capture the local environment of an atom, as given in Eq.
1
, where
\(i\)
indicates the atom whose local environment is being captured,
\(j\)
is a neighbor atom to
\(i\)
within a certain radial cut-off (
\({R}_{{cut}}\)
) with
\({r}_{{ij}}\)
being the distance between the two atom,
\(N\)
is the total number of neighbors within
\({R}_{{cut}}\)
,
\(P\)
is an atomic property (such as electronegativity), and
\(\alpha\)
is a Gaussian smoothing parameter. The term inside the summation computes a radial feature for each neighbor
\(j\)
based on the distance of interest
\(R\)
; as such, the descriptor
\({{pwRDF}}_{i}\left(R\right)\)
encodes the sum of atomic radial features of all neighbors at distance
\(R\)
from the atom
\(i\)
.
$${{pwRDF}}_{i}\left(R\right)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j\ne i}^{N}{P}_{j}\cdot {e}^{-\alpha {\left({r}_{{ij}}-R\right)}^{2}}$$
(1)
Moreover, we extend the
pwRDF
approach to capture the local angular environment of an atom with the atomic property weighted angular distribution function,
pwADF
, given in Eq.
2
. The summations enumerate over neighbor atoms
\(j\)
and
\(k\)
that are within a cutoff (
\({R}_{{cut}}\)
) of the central atom
\(i\)
, that form the angle
\({\theta }_{{jik}}\)
.
\({P}_{j}\)
and
\({P}_{k}\)
are atomic properties of atoms
\(j\)
and
\(k\)
, respectively, while
\(\beta\)
is a Gaussian smoothing parameter. It should also be noted that the set of neighbors
\(N\)
can be different for
pwRDF
and
pwADF
if a different radial cutoff (
\({R}_{{cut}}\)
) is chosen for the two descriptor functions. The descriptor
\({{pwADF}}_{i}\left(\Theta \right)\)
encodes the sum of the angular features subject to the angle of interest
\(\varTheta\)
around atom
\(i\)
.
$${{pwADF}}_{i}\left(\varTheta \right)\,=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j\ne i}^{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k\ne i,j}^{N}{P}_{j}\cdot {P}_{k}\cdot {e}^{-\beta {\left({\theta }_{{jik}}-\varTheta \right)}^{2}}$$
(2)
Next, we explore a variation of the
pwRDF
and
pwADF
, where a weighted average of the neighbors’ atomic properties based on the distance and angle of interest,
\(R\)
and
\(\varTheta\)
, are calculated. We call these the radial and angular weighted average atomic properties (
RWAAP
and
AWAAP
) and are given in Eqs.
3
and
4
. These descriptor functions take the form of the weighted average, where the atomic properties of the neighbors (i.e.,
\({P}_{j}\)
and
\({P}_{k}\)
) are weighted by the radial or the angular features (the Gaussian term).
$${{RWAAP}}_{i}\left(R\right)=\frac{\sum_{j\ne i}^{N}{P}_{j}\cdot {e}^{-\alpha {\left({r}_{{ij}}-R\right)}^{2}}}{\sum_{j\ne i}^{N}{e}^{-\alpha {\left({r}_{{ij}}-R\right)}^{2}}}$$
(3)
$${{AWAAP}}_{i}\left(\varTheta \right)=\frac{\sum_{j\ne i}^{N}\sum_{k\ne i,j}^{N}{P}_{j}\cdot {P}_{k}\cdot {e}^{-\beta {\left({\theta }_{{jik}}-\varTheta \right)}^{2}}}{\sum_{j\ne i}^{N}\sum_{k\ne i,j}^{N}{e}^{-\beta {\left({\theta }_{{jik}}-\varTheta \right)}^{2}}}$$
(4)
The third set of descriptors for the node feature vector are the atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs) which were first developed by Behler in 2011 for potential-energy surface predictions
31
. Gastegger et al.
52
adopted the weighted version to overcome the undesirable scaling of the number of ACSF descriptors as the number of chemical elements in the system increased. The weighted radial and angular ACSFs used in this work will be referred as
wRACSFs
and
wAACSFs
, respectively. The exact forms of the functions used here are given in Eqs.
5
–
7
. The formulation of the
wRACSF
(Eq.
5
) is similar to
pwRDF
(Eq.
1
) but with the additional term of the cut-off function (
\({f}_{{cut}}\)
). This cut-off function (Eq.
7
) gives a larger value as
\({r}_{{ij}}\)
approaches 0, therefore emphasizing short-range radial features. Note that the Gaussian smoothing parameter (
\(\gamma\)
) and the distance of interest (
\(\mu\)
) in the
wRACSF
have different symbols to differentiate them from similar parameters defined in previously described descriptors. The
wAACSF
(Eq.
6
) captures the angular features with the angular term (
\(1+\lambda \cdot {\theta }_{{jik}}\)
), where
\({\theta }_{{jik}}\)
is the angle spanned by the atom of interest
\(i\)
and two neighbors
\(j\)
and
\(k\)
. The phase parameter
\(\lambda =\pm 1\)
is the phase of the angular term on a polar plot. Gastegger et al.
52
suggested to generate different angular descriptors using different smoothing parameters (
\(\eta\)
in Eq.
6
) of the Gaussian term, which is what we adopted here. Compared to the original form of
wAACSF
, our formulation omits the
\(\zeta\)
parameter (an exponent term) and the
\(\mu\)
parameter (a Gaussian shifting term) that was in the original formulation since they are set to
\(\zeta =1\)
and
\(\mu =0\)
; more details about the parameters in the weighted ACSFs were discussed in the work by Gastegger et al.
52
$${{wRACSF}}_{i}\left(\mu \right)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j\ne i}^{N}{P}_{j}\cdot {e}^{-\gamma {\left({r}_{{ij}}-\mu \right)}^{2}}\cdot {f}_{{cut}}\left({r}_{{ij}}\right)$$
(5)
$${wAACS}{F}_{i}\left(\lambda ,\eta \right)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j\ne i}^{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k\ne i,j}^{N}{P}_{j}\cdot {P}_{k}\cdot \left(1+\lambda \cdot {\theta }_{{jik}}\right)\cdot {e}^{-\eta {\left({r}_{{ij}}+{r}_{{ik}}+{r}_{{jk}}\right)}^{2}}\cdot {f}_{{ij}}\cdot {f}_{{ik}}\cdot {f}_{{jk}}$$
(6)
$${f}_{{cut}}\left({r}_{{ij}}\right)={f}_{{ij}}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\cos \left(\frac{\pi {r}_{{ij}}}{{R}_{{cut}}}\right)\right]$$
(7)
Lastly, descriptors based on the average atomic properties of coordination shells of an atom in a system were used to train the RFR model in the work from Kancharlapalli et al.
26
. An illustrative figure of coordination shells is provided in Supplementary Note
5
. For this work, we compute three different types of coordination shell descriptors (Eqs.
8
–
10
), where the superscript
\(n\)
indicates the level of coordination shell, the second superscript (“avg”, “diff” or “std”) indicates the type of descriptor being calculated (average, difference, or standard deviation, respectively), the subscript
\(P\)
indicates an atomic property,
\(i\)
indicates the atom of interest,
\(N\)
is the number of atoms in the coordination shell,
\(j\)
indexes the atom in the coordination shell, and
\(\bar{{P}_{j}}\)
is the average atomic property in the coordination shell. The number of coordination shell descriptors depends on the number of levels of the covalent shells (
\(n\)
) and the number of atomic properties (
\(P\)
).
$${{Shell}}_{P}^{n,{avg}}\left(i\right)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{N}\frac{{P}_{j}}{N}$$
(8)
$${{Shell}}_{P}^{n,{diff}}\left(i\right)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{N}\frac{\left|{P}_{i}-{P}_{j}\right|}{N}$$
(9)
$${{Shell}}_{P}^{n,{std}}\left(i\right)=\sqrt{\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{N}\frac{{\left({P}_{j}-\bar{{P}_{j}}\right)}^{2}}{N}}$$
(10)
The atomic properties and the abovementioned descriptors of each atom are concatenated to yield the node feature vector for each atom. Due to the large numerical variance in these features, all node features are standard scaled based on features in the training set. Codes for all descriptor computations are implemented in our own Python codes; the exact parameters used for the descriptor functions are given in Supplementary Note
6
. A total of 226 features are generated for each atom in the MOF unit cell.
Model Architecture
Fig.
2a
shows the architecture of our MEPO-ML graph attention network model. The goal of the model is to predict the partial charges of the atoms
\({\boldsymbol{Q}}\)
from the graph representation of the MOF,
\(G=\left({\bf{X}},{\mathscr{E}}\right)\)
, that contains node features
\({\bf{X}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{n\times d}\)
and edges
\({\mathscr{E}}\in {\left\{\mathrm{0,1}\right\}}^{n\times n}\)
, where
\(n\)
is the number of nodes and
\(d\)
is the number of features for each node. The node features
\({\bf{X}}\)
are first transformed into hidden node embeddings
\({{\bf{H}}}^{0}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{n\times h}\)
via a multilayer perceptron (MLP), where
\(h\)
is the size of the embedding vector of each node. Then, the initial embeddings
\({{\bf{H}}}^{0}\)
are processed by an
\(L\)
-layer graph attention network (GAT) to generate hidden embeddings
\({{\bf{H}}}^{L}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{n\times h}\)
that describes the local environments of the nodes (more on this later). The hidden local embeddings
\({{\bf{H}}}^{L}\)
are transformed into the raw charge predictions
\({{\bf{Q}}}^{{raw}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{n}\)
via another MLP. Charge neutrality is enforced by evenly distributing the excess charges to yield the predicted charges
\({{\bf{Q}}}^{{pred}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{n}\)
as given in Eq.
11
. Unless otherwise specified, the loss is computed based on
\({{\bf{Q}}}^{{pred}}\)
(i.e., after charge neutralization). Details about the MLPs are provided in Supplementary Note
7
.
$${{\bf{Q}}}^{{pred}}={{\bf{Q}}}^{{raw}}-\frac{{\rm{sum}}\left({{\bf{Q}}}^{{raw}}\right)}{n}$$
(11)
To transfer inter-atomic information across chemical bonds via the graph of the chemical system, for each node, an
\(L\)
-layer GAT is applied to the initial embedding
\({{\bf{h}}}^{0}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{h}\)
to generate the local embedding
\({{\bf{h}}}^{L}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{h}\)
. Note that
\({\bf{H}}\)
is the matrix that includes all node embeddings of the whole graph,
\({\bf{h}}\)
is the embedding vector of a single node, and
\(h\)
is the size of
\({\bf{h}}\)
. Figure
2b
depicts the inner workings of the GAT layer. Each layer generates new hidden embeddings for each node in a three-step manner: attention computation, message passing and update. In the attention computation phase, an initial attention score
\(e\left({{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{l},{{\bf{h}}}_{j}^{l}\right)\)
is computed using Eq.
12
for every bonded atom pair
\(\left(i,j\right)\)
; this attention score indicates the importance of the embeddings of the neighbor
\(j\)
to the node
\(i\)
.
$$e\left({{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{l},{{\bf{h}}}_{j}^{l}\right)={{\bf{a}}}^{\left(l,a\right)}{\rm{LeakyReLU}}\left({{\bf{W}}}^{\left(l,a\right)}\left[{{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{l}\parallel {{\bf{h}}}_{j}^{l}\right]\right)$$
(12)
In this work, we used the
GATv2
implementation
53
of the attention function with a 0.2 negative slope for the leaky ReLU function; the superscript
\(l\)
indicates the
\(l\)
-th GAT layer
\(\left(0\le l < L\right)\)
,
\({\bf{a}}\)
and
\({\bf{W}}\)
are both learnable weight matrices, and “
\(\parallel\)
” denotes vector concatenation. In each layer, multiple attention scores can be computed for each bond using multiple sets of
\({\bf{a}}\)
and
\({\bf{W}}\)
; this is called the multi-head attention mechanism, and each set of
\({\bf{a}}\)
and
\({\bf{W}}\)
is called an attention head. If
\(A\)
attention scores are computed for each edge in one layer, the superscript
\(a\)
indicates the
\(a\)
-th attention head
\(\left(1\le a\le A\right)\)
. These attention scores are normalized across all neighbors
\({{\mathcal{N}}}_{\left(i\right)}\)
using the normalized exponential function (also known as the softmax function) to yield the normalized attention score
\(\alpha\)
(Eq.
13
). Self-loops are added to the graph during message passing, therefore
\({{\mathscr{N}}}_{\left(i\right)}\)
includes all atoms directly bonded to atom
\(i\)
and atom
\(i\)
itself.
$${\alpha }_{i,j}^{\left(l,a\right)}=\frac{\exp \left(e\left({{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{l},{{\bf{h}}}_{j}^{l}\right)\right)}{\sum _{k\in\mathcal{N}\left(i\right)}\exp \left(e\left({{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{l},{{\bf{h}}}_{j}^{l}\right)\right)}$$
(13)
In the message passing phase, the aggregated message of each node
\({{\bf{m}}}_{i}\)
is the aggregation of the neighbors’ transformed embeddings (
\({\bf{W}}{{\bf{h}}}_{k}\)
) weighted by the attention score
\({\alpha }_{i,k}\)
(Eq.
14
). The aggregation function (AGGR in Eq.
14
) can be as simple as a summation, however, in this work it was set as a hyperparameter of the network to be tuned from three functions: sum, mean, and max.
$${{\bf{m}}}_{i}^{(l,a)}={\rm{AGGR}}\,(\{{\alpha }_{i,k}^{(l,a)}{{\bf{W}}}^{(l,a)}{{\bf{h}}}_{k}^{l}|k\in {\mathcal{N}}(i)\})$$
(14)
To update hidden embeddings as the input for the next GAT layer, the aggregated messages of each node
\({{\bf{m}}}_{i}\)
from different attention heads are concatenated and then condensed down to a size-
\(h\)
embedding vector via a single feedforward layer; here, a single feedforward layer consists of a single linear layer followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation, denoted as “
\(\sigma\)
” in Eq.
15
.
$${{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{\left(l+1\right)}={\rm{\sigma }}\left(\left[{{\bf{m}}}_{i}^{\left(l,1\right)}\parallel \ldots \parallel {{\bf{m}}}_{i}^{\left(l,A\right)}\right]\right)$$
(15)
Model optimization and training
The graph attention networks (GAT) were constructed with PyTorch Geometric library
41
and trained using the PyTorch library
54
. Parameters of the GAT were optimized using the AdamW optimizer
55
with a learning rate of 0.001 and a weight decay coefficient of 0.0005. The GAT was trained with the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and a batch size of 128 graphs. The hyperparameters of the GAT were optimized with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm
56
using the Optuna library
57
. 100 optimization trials were run using the development set (10% of total data) with 5-fold cross-validation (CV) and the best hyperparameters were picked based on the lowest average MAE from the CV. After that, the GAT with the best hyperparameters were trained on the training set; MSE loss on the development set was computed during training and used as the early stopping criterion to prevent overfitting. The final metrics are computed using the test set.
Three additional models were trained and tested in a similar manner: (1) the gated graph neural network (GGNN) similar to the model purposed by Raza et al.
27
, (2) the random forest regressor (RFR) used by Kancharlapalli et al.
26
, and (3) the gradient boosted decision tree regressor (GBDTR) used by Korolev et al.
25
These models are trained with the same descriptors for the GAT model; more details on optimizing and training all ML models are described in Supplementary Note
7
.
Atomistic simulations
Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to compute the gas adsorption properties of MOFs, using our in-house code available on GitHub (
https://github.com/uowoolab/FastMC
). For atoms in the MOF structures, the steric and dispersion interactions between gases and MOFs were modeled using the Lennard-Jones potentials from the Universal Force Field (UFF)
58
, where the Lorenz-Berthelot mixing rules were applied for parameters between atoms of different types. Three different fixed partial atomic charge assignment schemes were examined for modeling the guest-host electrostatic interactions: the empirical SQE-MEPO charges
21
, the DFT-derived REPEAT charges
14
, and the predicted charges from the MEPO-ML model developed in this work. Three gases were introduced as guests in our simulations: CO
2
, N
2
, H
2
S. Force field parameters for CO
2
were taken from García-Sánchez et al.
59
, H
2
S from Kamath et al.
60
, and N
2
from Provost
61
. All simulations were performed at 298 K with 50,000 MC cycles for equilibration and production. We note that an MC cycle corresponds to n MC steps where n is the number of guest molecules in the simulation. The selectivities for binary guest simulations were calculated using Eq.
16
, where
\(S\)
is the selectivity,
\(N\)
is the gas adsorption uptake,
\(P\)
is the partial pressure of the gas.
$${S}_{A/B}=\frac{{N}_{A}}{{P}_{A}}/\frac{{N}_{B}}{{P}_{B}}$$
(16)
Density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations were performed using VASP version 5.4.4
62
with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional
63
with D3 dispersion corrections
64
and the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method
65
. A 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack sampling of k-points in the Brillouin zone was used. A constant volume MD simulation was run for 14 ps simulation using a 1 fs time step. All masses were scaled to 1 amu to sample the configuration space more rapidly. A stochastic Anderson thermostat
66
was applied with a probability of 0.2 set at a temperature of 300 K. The simulation was initiated from the experimental CALF-20 structure and all masses were all rescaled to 1.0 amu to generate varied geometric configurations more rapidly. REPEAT charge calculations
14
were performed in an identifical manner as in the ARC-MOF database
9
.

Transmission electron microscopy
Abstract
Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, coupled with a wide array of data analytics, has unveiled new insights into complex materials. Here, we introduce a straightforward unsupervised machine learning approach that entails dimensionality reduction and clustering with minimal hyperparameter tuning to semi-automatically identify unique coexisting structures in metallic alloys. Applying cepstral transformation to the original diffraction dataset improves this process by effectively isolating phase information from potential signal ambiguity caused by sample tilt and thickness variations, commonly observed in electron diffraction patterns. In a case study of a NiTiHfAl shape memory alloy, conventional scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging struggles to accurately identify a low-contrast precipitate at lower magnifications, posing challenges for microscale analyses. We find that our method efficiently separates multiple coherent structures while using objective means of determining hyperparameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the clustering result facilitates more robust strain mapping to provide immediate and quantitative structural insights.

Introduction
In the recent decade, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has become an increasingly popular technique for efficient data acquisition on complex materials at a wide range of length scales with high spatial resolution
1
,
2
,
3
,

,

,

,

. A nanosized electron probe is rastered across a two-dimensional (2D) region within a sample, and a 2D electron diffraction pattern is recorded for each scan position. The emergence of 4D-STEM is largely owed to the advent of ultrafast direct electron detectors, which feature a high readout speed and dynamic range
8
,
9
,
10
. Users are able to collect several gigabytes (GBs) of data in minutes, providing access to the entire angular range of electron scattering signals and, thus, a plethora of structural and functional property information. Key information extracted by 4D-STEM experiments include but is not limited to charge density mapping, three-dimensional (3D) structural information, polar skyrmion visualization, medium-range ordering in metallic glasses, and in-situ nanoparticle phase evolution

. Evidently, 4D-STEM stands at the frontier of materials characterization, offering a vast array of limitless opportunities. Swiftly collecting extensive, high-quality 4D datasets has now become standard practice with the availability of several open-source data analysis packages, thus underscoring the growing importance of efficient big data analysis

Unsupervised machine learning (USML) can alleviate the challenge of automating data analysis when dealing with new and complex material systems. There is no need for labeling or training, which alleviates much of the human effort needed to support supervised learning models
25
,

,
27
,
28
,
29
,
30
,
31
,

,

. The umbrella of USML methods encompasses dimensionality reduction, clustering, and even unsupervised neural networks like generative adversarial networks

,
35
,
36
,
37
,
38
,
39
,
40
,
41
. Current literature on utilizing USML for STEM data has shown promising results in distinguishing the stacking order of nanosized islands, visualizing defects in 2D materials, and examining fine edge structures
35
,
38
,

,

,

,
44
,

,

47
,

. Typically, some preprocessing is performed to first extract features of interest, such as specific Bragg diffracted discs or a targeted energy loss regime, to then use for clustering
39
,
42
,
46
. However, as we continue to emphasize, this is only applicable when the user already knows which features to look for in the first place.
In this paper, we present a novel methodology to enhance USML performance in characterizing complex microstructures with 4D-STEM using cepstral analysis. It is applicable across different datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning and prior knowledge required. The algorithm is employed for a NiTiHf-based shape memory alloy (SMA), serving as a representative case study. SMAs are characterized by their ability to recover their original structure upon heating after significant applied strain
50
. NiTiHf-based SMAs, in particular, exhibit precipitation strengthening with the formation of coherent precipitates and are suitable for high-temperature applications due to their high martensitic transformation temperatures, which has opened up much interest from the aerospace and automotive sectors
51
,
52
. Specifically, the precipitation strengthening originates from the Ni(Ti
0.6
Hf
0.4
) Han phase precipitates embedded in the NiTi B2 matrix phase that have been identified for NiTiHf systems in previous studies
53
,
54
,
55
,
56
,
57
. In pursuit of augmenting their mechanical strength, the incorporation of Al into NiTiHf SMAs has been explored, which leads to the formation of a secondary precipitate, the Ni
2
TiAl Heusler phase
58
,
59
. In a recent investigation by Hsu et al. on a Ni
50
Ti
25-x
Hf
20
Al
x
system, alloying Al resulted in the coexistence of Han and Heusler precipitates while increasing mechanical strength
60
. However, increasing Al content was also directly correlated to lowering martensitic transformation temperature, which is counterproductive for high-temperature applications. The complexity of the problem deepens with the lack of knowledge regarding other potentially coexisting phases in this quaternary alloy. Therefore, the crux of the materials design problem lies in optimizing the competing desirable properties and correlating them to their structural origins, including precipitate formation and strain. This task requires testing a range of composition and processing combinations, each of which will produce several 4D datasets. The magnitude of this investigation mandates an automated and universally applicable data analytics methodology capable of consistently distinguishing between various phases across multiple datasets.

with STEM
A low-magnification HAADF-STEM image in Fig.
1a
shows an array of vertically aligned, needle-shaped, Han phase precipitates embedded in the B2 matrix. Due to the relatively high content of heavy Hf atoms, the Han phase precipitates are denoted by higher image intensities as compared to the B2 matrix. Initial investigation reveals three distinct atomically resolved structures at the edge of one precipitate shown in Fig.
1b
labeled as “1”, “2”, and “3”. In order to properly identify these structures, we use high-magnification HAADF-STEM images, which are displayed in the top row of Fig.
1c
. These three phases are determined to be the B2 matrix, Han precipitate, and Heusler precipitate, and their corresponding nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) patterns are given in the bottom row of Fig.
1c
. Both image and diffraction data unambiguously isolated three unique phases and determined their orientation relationship given by the coordinate axes in Fig.
1c
. Notably, HAADF-STEM imaging revealed that both precipitates, Han and Heusler, maintain structural coherency with the B2 matrix as well as each other. Additionally, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis provided insight into the chemical variations across the different phases. An EDS line scan in Fig.
S1
is drawn across the edge of a Han precipitate, from which the atomic structure of the Heusler phase is visible and correlates to an increased Al concentration and decreased Ti concentration.

Characterizing the Heusler phase formation is key to understanding this SMA system as it is directly linked to the addition of Al, and thus linked with improved strengthening and lowered martensitic transformation temperatures
60
. However, the Heusler phase exhibits significantly diminished contrast relative to the B2 matrix due to similar atomic arrangements and constituent elements with only minute addition of a light element, Al, to the Heusler phase. As a result, identifying nanoscale coherent Heusler phase precipitates at larger length scales, and thus lower magnifications, is challenging via imaging alone, albeit achieving atomic resolution. Note that the Heusler phase was not distinguishable in the low-magnification HAADF-STEM image in Fig.
1a
and only more discernable upon increasing magnification in Fig.

by examining the subtle difference in atomic arrangements. Consequently, applying image segmentation methods to the low-magnification HAADF-STEM images in order to quantify the presence of the Heusler phase did not seem properly viable as relatively high contrast features have been used for these types of identification tasks in other studies

. On the other hand, the NBED patterns in the bottom row of Fig.
1c
exhibit better contrast between the three phases due to their distinction from one another, which led us to employ 4D-STEM to further this study. The 4D-STEM workflow, schematized in Fig.
2
, produced 4D diffraction datasets that were subject to either principal component analysis (PCA) or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction, which was followed by K-means clustering to gauge the performance on phase segregation. Afterward, a cepstral transformation was applied to these diffraction datasets, and this 4D cepstrum stack was then subject to the same USML algorithm to compare their results.
Fig. 2: Schematic of 4D-STEM experiment and data analysis workflow.
At each electron beam scan position, a nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) pattern is acquired by the EMPAD and stored in a 4D dataset. PCA or NMF with K-means clustering is applied to the NBED dataset to evaluate phase segregation capability. A cepstral transform is then applied to the NBED dataset and run through the same clustering algorithm to compare the performance of all four combinations.

Trial 1: PCA and NMF + K-means clustering on original NBED dataset
The process starts by normalizing all diffraction patterns acquired from the 4D-STEM scan region visualized in the virtual annular dark-field (vADF) image in Fig.
3a
, where the Han precipitate stands out with its darker contrast. We then apply PCA and NMF to decompose the dataset into five components. We established the choice of number of components by first decomposing the dataset into
n
components, with
n
ranging from two to ten. We then calculate the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between the original and decomposed datasets for an average of ten runs per value of
n
. Figure
S2
shows an example of one of these RMSE vs
n
plots. Note that as
n
> 5, there is an onset of a plateau that indicates a worsened tradeoff between gaining more accuracy and longer processing times.

The unfavorable clustering results from this initial trial are shown in Fig.

b and
3
d, respectively, where the automatically determined structural patterns do not have any inherent correlation to the material itself. The respective K values were determined by the elbow point method, which is described in Methods and displayed in Fig.
S3a
. There is a likeness to the needle-shaped Han precipitate (Fig.
3a
), but the dark blue that represents the Han precipitate cluster also appears in the outer regions where the matrix and Heusler should reside based on our initial STEM imaging study. As a means to quantitatively gauge the clustering performance, cluster-averaged NBED patterns are displayed next to the NBED + PCA and NBED + NMF cluster maps in Fig.
3
c and
3
e, respectively. It is clear that while the distinction of the Han phase NBED stands out in Cluster 1 and Cluster 4 for the PCA and NMF trials, respectively, the algorithm matches up seemingly random parts of the non-Han precipitate regions as being part of the same clusters. Aside from slight differences in intensities, Clusters 0 and 2 in Fig.
3c
, Clusters 0 and 3 in Fig.
3e
, and Clusters 1 and 2 in Fig.
3e
are very similar to each other. Unfortunately, this makes the actual post-clustering phase identification a nontrivial task.
In order to better understand these results, Fig.
4
shows the NBED + NMF clustering result with two individual NBED patterns from opposite sides of the Han precipitate that were partitioned into separate clusters. The NBED patterns revealed that both areas correspond to the B2 Matrix phase, yet they were still separated by the algorithm. This is likely due to the uneven intensity distributions present in these NBED patterns, which are typically observed in electron diffract data and arise from local sample tilting or bending. The red arrows in the NBED patterns point to the pattern’s center of mass and indicate that the two patterns have opposite intensity distributions. This indeed implies that a key feature of the data is the local sample bending around the Han precipitate. This was nonideal for the purpose of this case study, as we would like the algorithm to identify features that would normally be used to distinguish phases, such as the position and symmetry of peaks in the diffraction patterns rather than the intensity variations. This was a significant challenge to encounter in that one cannot simply force the dimensionality reduction algorithms to prioritize certain parts or features in the dataset.

Trial 2: Comparing USML methods on cepstral transformed 4D dataset
The cepstral transform of electron diffraction data was first proposed by Padgett et al. as a means to precisely quantify strain maps from diffraction data that may be subject to unfavorable, complex multiple scattering effects
64
. This study found that the cepstral transformation effectively decouples lattice information from intensity variations caused by tilt and thickness. The cepstrum pattern,
C
P
, can be calculated from an electron diffraction pattern,
\(I(\mathop{k}\limits^{ \rightharpoonup })\)
, using Eq.
1
where
\({\mathscr{F}}\)
stands for a Fourier transform.
$${C}_{P}=|{\mathscr{F}}(\mathrm{ln}(I(\mathop{k}\limits^{ \rightharpoonup })))|$$
(1)
Since the diffraction patterns represent a crystal’s signal in reciprocal space, the peaks in the cepstrum pattern represent interatomic spacings within the real space structure. This technique has been used across a wide variety of studies in this field, from strain mapping to imaging local short-range ordering in high entropy alloys
64
,
65
,
66
,
67
,
68
,
69
,
70
. The significant motivation provided by these early works encourages the application of this transformation method to the SMA dataset to see if the isolation of phase information from those of sample bending would be reflected in the subsequent clustering results.
The corresponding Cepstrum + PCA and Cepstrum + NMF cluster maps in Fig.
5
a and
5c
depict a clear, sharp boundary around the Han precipitate with no mixing into other regions like in Fig.
3
b and
3d
. For the Cepstrum + NMF cluster map in particular, Cluster 2 appears to visually match well with the expectation from initial HAADF-STEM imaging that the Heusler phase tends to be located in pockets at the side edges of the Han precipitate. Quantitatively, the values in the inertia plots for Cepstrum + PCA and Cepstrum + NMF in Fig.
S3b
are about two orders of magnitude lower than those for the original diffraction dataset, indicating a much tighter K-means clustering output for both the PCA and NMF case, but more so for the latter. The clustering results were once again validated by taking both averaged diffraction and cepstrum patterns for each cluster map in Fig.
5
b and
5
d. While the averaged NBED patterns in Fig.
5b
are now more distinct from each other, the averaged cepstrum patterns for Clusters 0 and 2 are very similar. On the other hand, the results in Fig.
5d
show no significant signs of overlapping or mixed signals between phases from either the NBED or Cepstrum patterns, indicating a highly precise clustering result for the Cepstrum + NMF combination. This is determined by comparing these averaged patterns with the individual representative patterns collected from each phase, as seen in Fig.
S4
, and noting that the averaged patterns do not exhibit irregular or unexpected ordering. Furthermore, a cepstrum vDF image in Fig.
S5a
, using spots unique to the Heusler cepstrum pattern in Fig.
S5b
, shows the expected locations of the Heusler phase that once again match well with the layout of Cluster 2 in the Cepstrum + NMF cluster map. The phase mixing in the Cepstrum + PCA cluster map may be attributed to the orthogonality constraint, as noted in a prior study comparing PCA vs NMF for grain mapping in Au-Pd nanoparticles
35
. This orthogonality constraint allows negative values in the PCA components, which are nonphysical with respect to electron diffraction patterns. Therefore, the components highlighted by the PCA method cannot be linked to any physical crystal structure. To this extent, NMF is more well-suited for applications in electron diffraction data analysis. A similar conclusion was reached in another study that applied unsupervised machine learning to scanning precession electron diffraction data for semi-automatically separating twinned structures

Moreover, the improved quality of the clustering result for the Cepstrum + NMF combination compared to that of the NBED + NMF combination can be mainly attributed to the cepstral analysis of the original dataset. This is seen in Fig.
6
, where the two cepstrum patterns corresponding to the two NBED patterns in Fig.
4
are displayed with the Cepstrum + NMF cluster map. Clearly, while both diffraction patterns in Fig.
4
exhibit a level of uneven intensity distribution due to sample bending, the cepstrum patterns are centrosymmetric. This result shows how the cepstral transform successfully decouples the lattice structure from the effects of bending. This augmented clustering result can now be used to obtain a more objective map calculation since we have precise access to the locations of particular phases we may want to prioritize as reference structures.

An objective selection of a reference for strain mapping aided by clustering
A fundamental step of strain mapping is the selection of a reference structure, which is normally a user-subjective step. While this step may be relatively straightforward in an epitaxial thin film scenario where the substrate is typically the reference
71
,
72
, it is complicated in this SMA system due to the existence of complex microstructures. Nonetheless, through the application of the aforementioned USML workflow, users gain precise access to all data points associated with any given cluster. Therefore, one can readily opt for any cluster as a reference and subsequently average the measured lattice parameters to yield a statistically robust reference lattice. This reference lattice will be self-consistent with every iteration of the workflow. Additionally, it is strongly suggested to omit boundary points to avoid extracting reference lattice information from mixed signals. For the current study, this is accomplished by the application of a 2D convolution over the cluster map using a kernel size of 11 × 11, which corresponds to a roughly 16.5 × 16.5 nm
2
region in this scan region.
The resulting strain maps for this scan region are shown in Fig.
7
using the B2 matrix points in Cluster 0 of Fig.
5c
to build the reference lattice using the peak pairs method discussed in Methods. Based on the known structure models, the X-direction lattice parameters of the Han and Heusler phase are expected to be larger and smaller than that of the matrix, respectively, which is reflected in Fig.
7
73
,
74
. Interestingly, the
ε
xx
strain map contains similar patterns to those observed in the Cepstrum +NMF cluster map with a clear demarcation of the Han precipitate and Heusler phase locations, which adds to the validation of our clustering algorithm’s performance. In order to quantify the precision of the strain measurement, a subset of matrix lattice parameters measurements from an assumed homogenous region is taken to calculate the standard deviation as a representation of error. The standard deviations of strain in the X-direction and Y-direction are 0.0020 and 0.0017 (or 0.2% and 0.17%), respectively. Based on work done by Yu and colleagues
75
, the strain fields are likely linked to the formation mechanisms of the precipitates, namely their equilibrium shape and size, which subsequently affects the bulk properties. Hence, possessing this dependable strain calculation method that seamlessly adapts from the clustering results is of utmost value.

Application of USML to a larger field-of-view
We now apply the proposed USML method to a dataset acquired from a larger field of view without prior investigation of the possible existing structures in this region. Enhancing the ability to apply microscale statistical analysis of phase volume fraction, capture complex microstructures, and strain modulation, rather than nano or atomic scale, holds profound significance for metallurgical research. Being able to precisely extract the locations of the secondary precipitate, despite their relatively small volume, with lower spatial resolution scans would prove invaluable.
A vADF image of the larger scan region, using NBED pattern intensities, is displayed in Fig.
8a
along with its Cepstrum + NMF clustering result in Fig.
8b
for K = 4 (determined by elbow point method, Fig.
S6
). There are clear boundaries around the needle-shaped precipitates, and the average NBED and cepstrum patterns in Fig.
8c
show little sign of intermixing between phases. Clusters 0, 1, and 2 were quickly identified as the B2, Han, and Heusler phases initially described in Fig.
1
. Interestingly, a fourth cluster is automatically segregated from the rest of the previously known phases such that two different types of needle-shaped precipitates appear to coexist as Clusters 1 and 3. Cluster 3, upon further investigation, was identified as the [001] Han phase, a 90° rotated version of the [010] Han phase structure initially observed (Fig.
S7
). Therefore, a noteworthy finding from this study is the coexistence of both Han precipitate orientation relationships within this SMA system. This emphasizes the potential of this data analysis technique, as it automatically identified the new orientation relationship between the B2 matrix and Han precipitates without extensive surveying and imaging of the sample in the TEM. Moreover, the new finding holds great significance in understanding this material system, since varying orientation relationships affect interfacial structures and are likely to have an impact on the macroscopic properties of interest (e.g., martensitic transformation pathways and shape recovery performance)

In summary, we provide a simple and effective USML workflow that demonstrates how the combination of cepstral analysis, NMF, and K-means clustering is an ideal combination for visualizing the arrangement of coherent, heterogeneous structures at small to large length scales in the TEM. The performance was judged based on the visual quality of the clustering maps, good agreement with the cepstrum vDF image, and the lack of phase intermixing in the cluster-averaged diffraction and cepstrum patterns. This analysis can be performed semi-automatically with objective means of determining just two input parameters, the number of components and number of clusters, and minimal prior knowledge of the material system. Additionally, we establish the usage of the clustering results to declare an objective reference lattice from which more robust strain maps can be collected. The ε
xx
strain map, in particular, featured structural patterns that matched very well with those in the Cepstrum + NMF cluster map, thus furthering our confidence in the effectiveness of this USML method. We expect that this data analysis method will excel at accelerating systematic studies on novel multiphase systems and improving our understanding of fundamental processing-structure-property relationships. As such, we strongly encourage the use of the aforementioned USML workflow in other complex materials to gain greater insight into the correlations between structural formation mechanisms and macroscopic properties of interest to inform better materials design considerations.
Moving forward, we note that this particular workflow has performed well for the phase segregation task thanks to the innate properties of the cepstral analysis, but not when precise orientation determination is needed. In that case, using the original NBED 4D dataset would be better suited and may be augmented by applying energy filtering
79
,
80
. The SMA study itself would also benefit from expanding on the cepstral analysis through the application of different cepstrums. This method can offer improved visualization and insight into local ordering within disordered material systems, especially in alloys with nonuniform chemical distritbuion

alloy was fabricated by arc-melting under an ultra-high purity argon atmosphere. The raw metals from Alfa Aesar, Ni wires (99.5% purity), Ti wires (99.7% purity), Hf wires (99.7% purity), and Al wires (99.999% purity) were weighed and melted into buttons. The buttons were flipped six times to ensure homogeneity. The as-cast material was vacuum-sealed in a quartz tube, solution-treated at 950 °C for 100 h and quenched in oil. The same encapsulation procedure was followed to age the alloy at 600°C for 100 h and oil-quenched once again. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the martensitic transformation temperature for this particular composition, which was found to be below the minimum scan temperature of −60 ˚C. This sample is used as a reference point to which future studies on other NiTiHfAl SMAs can be compared.
STEM experiments and sample preparation
The lamella for STEM and 4D-STEM analysis was prepared using standard focused ion beam (FIB) procedures with 30 kV coarse thinning followed by cleaning at 5 kV and 2 kV. Prior to FIB preparation, the alloy specimens were successively polished using 1200-grit SiC papers and diamond slurry of 3, 1, and 0.3 μm. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in STEM was performed on an aberration-corrected Themis Z STEM (Fisher Scientific) at 200 kV with a probe semiconvergence angle of 22 mrad, probe current of 25 pA, camera length of 115 mm, and detector inner cutoff collection angle of 58 mrad. 4D-STEM experiments were also performed on the Themis Z, which is equipped with an electron microscope pixel array detector (EMPAD). The accelerating voltage was 200 kV with an electron probe size (full width at half maximum) of ~1.5 nm using a probe semiconvergence angle of 0.94 mrad, camera length of 360 mm, and C2 aperture size of 50 μm. Two 4D datasets were acquired using scan step sizes of 0.40 nm and 0.68 nm to cover 163.8 × 63.7 nm
2
and 213 × 213 nm
2
regions, respectively. The exposure time was set to 10 ms, and the screen current was set such that the EMPAD was subject to a current density of less than 2 pA/pixel.
Principal component analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) operates by finding a set number of orthogonal components that are linear combinations of the original data while retaining maximum variance
36
. The orthogonality constraint makes PCA more visually interpretable in 2D and 3D representations, but it also allows for negative values that are nonphysical in the context of electron diffraction patterns. The PCA algorithm seeks to factorize the matrix
X
into a product of three other matrices,
C,
D
, and
V
. First,
X
is centered at its mean, which allows PCA to be performed using singular value decomposition as in Eq.
2
where
X
is decomposed to a number of components
r
.
$${X}_{{mxn}}\approx {C}_{{mxr}}{D}_{{rxr}}{V}_{{rxn}}^{T}$$
(2)
D
is a diagonal matrix where the elements along the diagonal are arranged in descending order. The square of these values gives the variances explained by the corresponding principal component. Essentially, the product of
C
and
D
, we denote this as
P
, gives the principal components in the columns while the values in
V
are the weights, or coefficients, that dictate each component’s contribution to a corresponding original data point in
X
.
Nonnegative matrix factorization
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) learns the parts of an image without an orthogonality constraint while keeping all elements positive
37
. This results in components that are physically interpretable as electron diffraction patterns since negative electron counts are not possible. In the original work by Lee and Seung
37
, it was shown that NMF results in components that are mostly sparse (empty) while holding only a specific feature, such as an eyebrow or chin in the case of facial image analysis. The matrix factorization with NMF is similar to that of PCA:
$${X}_{{mxn}} \sim {W}_{{mxr}}{H}_{{rxn}}$$
(3)
Mathematically, NMF is defined by Eq.
3
above, where the two matrices
W
and
H
are analogous to
P
and
V
in PCA, respectively. NMF learns the best representation of the dataset when reduced to a lower rank
r
by minimizing the difference between the original data
X
and the product of the basis vectors
W
and corresponding weights
H
.
K-means clustering
K-means clustering minimizes the Euclidian distance between data points and their respective cluster centers
82
. After the entire dataset is reduced down to its optimal number of components from either PCA or NMF, each set of components is clustered using the K-means algorithm. The elbow method is used to pick the optimal value of K due to our lack of knowledge of all possible coexisting phases. First, the within-sum-of-squares (WSS), or inertia, is plotted against a range of K values to determine the optimal choice for number of clusters. The elbow point is the K-value where incrementing K to K + 1 does not provide as much optimization as incrementing K – 1 to K. In other words, the elbow point of the inertia curve is where the second derivative initially becomes negative, or the slope decreases. These plots are made such that each point representing an inertia value for a value of K is an average of 10 individual runs with random initializations. In cases where the elbow point is unclear, we suggest erring toward a higher K-value since two or more clusters that are found to be of the same phase can simply be conjoined after the fact. On the contrary, underestimating the K-value can lead to missing important unique structures that may otherwise only be distinguishable by subtle features.
Strain mapping—peak pairs method
The peak pairs analysis method is utilized to create strain maps, which was first introduced by Galindo et al.
71
. Lattice parameters are calculated for every pattern in sub-pixel units, and a portion of those are used to define a reference lattice with two basis vectors. The selection of reference lattice points is often subjective, but it is later described how the clustering results can be used to consistently form ideal references. From here, the longitudinal and shear strain can be calculated using the equations below.
$$\begin{array}{c}\left[\begin{array}{c}{e}_{{yx}}\\ {e}_{{yy}}\end{array}\right]={\left[\begin{array}{cc}{a}_{x} & {a}_{y}\\ {b}_{x} & {b}_{y}\end{array}\right]}^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{c}{u}_{y}\\ {v}_{y}\end{array}\right]\\ \left[\begin{array}{c}{e}_{{xx}}\\ {e}_{{xy}}\end{array}\right]={\left[\begin{array}{cc}{a}_{x} & {a}_{y}\\ {b}_{x} & {b}_{y}\end{array}\right]}^{-1}\left[\begin{array}{c}{u}_{x}\\ {v}_{x}\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$

Abstract
The neural-network quantum states (NNQS) method is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool in quantum mechanisms. While significant advancements have been achieved in simulating simple molecules using NNQS, the ab initio simulation of complex solid-state materials remains challenging. Here in this work, we have adopted the periodic density matrix embedding theory to extend the NNQS method to deal with complex solid-state systems. Our approach notably reduces the computational problem size while maintaining high accuracy. We have validated the accuracy and efficiency of our method against traditional methodologies and experimental data in extended systems, and have investigated the magnetic ordering and charge density wave state in transition metal compounds. The findings from our research indicate that the integration of quantum embedding with intuitive chemical fragmentation can significantly enhance the NNQS simulation of realistic materials.

Introduction
The electronic structure and properties of materials can, in principle, be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation to obtain an exact solution of the wave function. The square of this wave function represents the probability density function for finding the many electrons simultaneously. The most difficult task is finding a general way to reduce the exponential complexity of the full many-body wave function and the extraction of its most essential features. Various approaches have been developed to solve the Schrödinger equation for realistic systems. Although the full configuration interaction (FCI) method offers ground-truth results, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space limits the size of feasible simulations. To approximate the exact energy, several strategies have been devised, including perturbation theory

. However, these methods can fail in numerous cases, mostly due to the inefficient expressive power of the wave function ansatz. Very recently, the neural-network quantum state (NNQS) algorithm with better expressive power has been proposed as a groundbreaking approach for tackling many-body quantum systems

. The main idea behind NNQS is to parameterize the quantum wave function using a neural-network architecture and to optimize its parameters using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm stochastically, and the computational cost of NNQS typically scales polynomially. However, the sampling process within Monte Carlo processes may be inefficient in certain situations with a low acceptance rate and can result in correlated samples. To address this challenge, we have presented QiankunNet
13
,
14
to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation with a language model. QiankunNet adeptly harnesses the language model’s prowess to effectively capture highly non-trivial quantum correlations by integrating the attention mechanism and enhancing the sampling process through a batched autoregressive sampling strategy. Moreover, QiankunNet can incorporate essential physics knowledge into neural networks, striking a balance between respecting physics principles and enhancing computational efficiency.

, however, the algorithmic development of the NNQS method for periodic systems is still in the early stage, and so far, most of the current studies have been limited to simple solids systems such as homogeneous electron gas
19
, hydrogen chain
20
and lithium hydride crystals
21
. This is because the necessity of approaching the thermodynamic limit (TDL)
22
results in an extra dimension of computational variables compared to their molecular counterparts, which demands huge computational resources, and the complexity of electronic correlation in periodic systems requires high expressiveness of neural networks, so even using high-performance computing architectures, it is still challenging to apply them to complex materials. An important requirement to tackle complex materials is the reduction of the region treated at the highest level of accuracy, and the quantum embedding method is one of the solutions, which divides a large system into smaller fragments, and enables an accurate treatment of each fragment using a high-level computational method. There has been a lot of progress in the quantum embedding method

. Within the quantum embedding method, density matrix embedding theory (DMET) is a promising framework because it can intrinsically allow high-level treatments for multiple fragments using a high-level theory, unlike the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with active space or projection-based embedding, which have been mostly developed for one single fragment or one correlated site. DMET has been successfully applied to a variety of chemical systems, ranging from molecules to extended solid-state systems

. It is particularly useful for studying systems where electron correlation significantly influences the physical and chemical properties. However, the combination of DMET with the state-of-the-art NNQS method to deal with complex materials problems is still missing.
Here in this work, we integrate the NNQS solver—QiankunNet into the DMET method to offer a balance between computational feasibility and accuracy, particularly for systems where electron correlation is critical. The schematic of the DMET-QiankunNet framework is shown in Fig.
1
. In this framework, the global system is partitioned into smaller subsystems, and each fragment is treated as a subsystem (referred to as the impurity) embedded in a larger environment, with the interactions between the subsystem and its environment being carefully accounted for. The electronic structure of each subsystem is accurately solved with QiankunNet while also accounting for the effect of the rest of the system. This is achieved by constructing a local density matrix that represents the subsystem and its immediate environment. Additionally, we have employed a self-consistent periodic quantum embedding method to achieve the TDL, and we use the periodic quantum chemistry method to efficiently treat long-range interactions. Furthermore, based on the observation that embedding Hamiltonians in the quantum embedding iteration generally exhibits similar structures, the parameters for neural networks to determine the ground state of these Hamiltonians should not differ significantly. Consequently, a transfer learning strategy has been developed, whereby most Hamiltonians in the DMET iteration only require fine-tuning of the neural network. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the theory, we employ the DMET-QiankunNet algorithm in a variety of periodic systems, ranging from simple to complex cases. These include the one-dimensional hydrogen chain, the diamond crystal, the investigation of magnetic ordering in four different transition metal oxides, and the study of the charge density wave (CDW) state in 1T-TiSe
2
. The results of the one-dimensional hydrogen chain and the diamond crystal are compared with DMET-FCI results or DMET-CCSD results when the FCI solver reaches its limit. The results of transition metal oxides and 1T-TiSe

are compared with existing theoretical or experimental research. Our findings indicate that the combination of the QiankunNet NNQS solver with the DMET method enables the simulation of strongly correlated materials on a large scale with remarkable accuracy.

Numerical results and applications
One-dimensional hydrogen chain
We initiate our investigation with numerical simulations of the one-dimensional equispaced hydrogen chain (1D-H). The potential energy surface (PES), with H-H distance varying from 0.6 to 2.0, is calculated. The hydrogen chain, although consisting of a simple atomic arrangement, holds significant importance in the field of strongly correlated materials. The strong electron correlation becomes significant as the H-H distance increases. Such a system provides a valuable foundation for comprehending various fundamental physical phenomena, including the insulator-to-metal transition and the antiferromagnetic Mott phase
33
. The unit cell of the hydrogen chain is presumed to comprise 2 hydrogen atoms. A GTH-SVZ basis set, along with the GTH-PADE pseudo-potential, is employed. Given the small size of this system, there is no need to further partition the unit cell into fragments; each unit cell is treated as an individual fragment. Consequently, the corresponding embedding Hamiltonian contains 6 orbitals: 2 impurity orbitals, 2 virtual orbitals, and 2 bath orbitals. Two different k-point meshes (1 × 1 × 5, 1 × 1 × 11) are used. To assess the accuracy of the NNQS solver, the results are compared to the same DMET calculation using an FCI solver. For DMET-NNQS results with 5 k-points, the results are also compared to the FCI results.
Figure
2
presents the potential energy surface for a one-dimensional hydrogen chain calculated using the DMET-NNQS method and several classical approaches. In the case of 5 k-points, the DMET-NNQS method, alongside the CCSD and MP2 methods, closely aligns with FCI results when the H-H distance is less than 1.2 Å. However, as the distance approaches 2.0 Å, classical methods deviate from the FCI results. Notably, the MP2 method significantly underestimates the correlation energy, and the CCSD method yields unreasonable results for an H-H distance exceeding 1.5 Å, failing to converge beyond 1.7 Å. In contrast, the DMET-NNQS method consistently matches the FCI results across all H-H distance values. The absolute error between the DMET-NNQS method and FCI results is depicted in Fig
2
c. As illustrated in the figure, the energy difference between DMET-NNQS and the FCI method ranges from −1 milli-Hartree to 3 milli-Hartree. Remarkably, for an H-H distance larger than 1.0 Å, the DMET-NNQS results fall within the realm of chemical accuracy. Moreover, the energy deviation is even smaller between the DMET-NNQS method and the DMET-FCI method, with an absolute energy difference ranging from 1 × 10
−7
Hartree to 1 × 10
−5
Hartree. Such high precision underscores the remarkable accuracy of the NNQS solver. In the case of 11 k-points, achieving convergence becomes more challenging for classical methods. The CCSD method fails to converge for H-H distance larger than 1.3 Å. The MP2 method consistently underestimates the correlation energy for H-H distances larger than 1.2 Å. Moreover, MP2 results for H-H distances greater than 1.8 Å deviate from the trend observed in the curve. However, the DMET-NNQS method continues to produce reasonable results even with a large number of k-points. The energy difference compared to the DMET-FCI method remains at a very low level, attesting to the method’s robustness in handling larger k-point meshes. Results for both 5 and 11 k-points predict the existence of an equilibrium structure. For all the calculated H-H distances, the energy minimum is found at 1.1 Å. After interpolation, an energy minimum is estimated to be around 1.073 Å. Previous theoretical calculations have reported the equilibrium structure of a one-dimensional hydrogen chain when hydrogen atoms are equispaced at 0.984 Å
34
or 1.058 Å
20
. The equilibrium distance predicted in this work is slightly larger than previously reported results. This slight difference is attributed to the different basis sets used, as the GTH-SZV basis is used in this work while the cited works used the STO-6G basis and STO-3G basis respectively. The DMET-NNQS method was employed for additional calculations, systematically varying the number of k-points in the range of 5 to 17, and extrapolating the results to

Bulk diamond
Our simulation is then extended to a realistic 3D material, the diamond crystal, to assess the performance of DMET-NNQS in a larger system. The structure of the primitive cell of the diamond crystal is depicted in Fig.
3
e, each unit cell comprises two carbon atoms. As the GTH pseudo-potential and GTH-DZVP basis set are employed, each carbon atom contains 2s2p3s3p3d, totaling 13 atomic orbitals. In this section, three distinct fragmentation schemes are defined to evaluate the performance when different atomic orbital sets are assigned to the impurity. In every scheme the two carbon atoms are partitioned into two different fragments and different atomic orbitals are included in the impurity: (1) 2s2p, (2) 2s2p3s3p, and (3) 2s2p3s3p3d. Orbitals not included in the impurity are evaluated at the Hartree-Fock level. A series of unit cell energies is calculated by varying the lattice constant ‘a’. All mean-field calculations in this section utilize a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh.

The results of this calculation are shown in Fig.
3
. A comparison between DMET-NNQS results with different orbital partition schemes indicates that by including more orbitals in the impurity, more correlation energy can be recovered. The absolute correlation energy calculated with the DMET-NNQS method, when only 2s2p orbitals are included in the impurity, only accounts for 63.06% of the correlation energy obtained by DMET-NNQS calculation, which includes all the orbitals (2s2p3s3p3d). For DMET-NNQS results with 2s2p3s3p orbitals included in the impurity, the percentage increases to 67.65%. These results emphasize that including more orbitals in the impurity partition leads to greater accuracy. While this may not hold significant implications for diamonds, as the 3d orbitals of carbon atoms are barely occupied, it becomes crucial for more complex systems, particularly those containing transition metals. This aspect will be explored further in the section “Transition metal oxides”. Fig.
3
b depicts the DMET-NNQS results with 2s2p orbitals of the carbon atoms included in the impurity, alongside the DMET results with an FCI solver. It is evident that the DMET-NNQS results align closely with the DMET-FCI method. The average deviation between the two methods is 2.12 × 10
−4
Hartree, which again shows the high accuracy of the NNQS solver. The DMET-NNQS results with 2s2p3s3p orbitals and all orbitals included in the impurity are compared to the same DMET calculations with the CCSD solver as shown in Fig.
3
c, d. It is clear that the DMET-NNQS method recovers more correlation energy than the DMET-CCSD method because the NNQS solver provides more accurate results than the CCSD solver. The NNQS solver still demonstrates remarkable accuracy for Hamiltonians with a large number of orbitals. All three DMET-NNQS calculations yield an equilibrium structure with a lattice constant of 2.55 Å, slightly larger than the expected value of 2.527 Å. The task of predicting the equilibrium lattice constant has been essentially achieved. To further improve the results, it would be necessary to use a larger and more complete basis set for the calculation. Another potential way to improve the results is to use the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS)
35
to obtain the results of thermodynamic limit (TDL), as is done in Cui’s work

Transition metal oxides
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) constitute a class of compounds with pivotal roles in diverse scientific and technological realms, owing to their intriguing electronic and magnetic properties. The applications of TMOs span catalysis, energy storage, and electronic devices. Furthermore, the intricate interplay between the electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of TMOs has fueled the exploration of cutting-edge technologies, including spintronics. Understanding the magnetic order of transition metal oxides is of great importance due to its profound impact on the material’s overall properties.
Three different transition metal oxides (VO
2
, MnO, and NiO) are simulated with the DMET-NNQS method to predict the magnetic order. VO
2
has a rutile structure, as is shown in Fig.
4
a. Each transition metal atom is coordinated with six oxygen atoms, forming an octahedral arrangement. MnO and NiO both have a rock salt structure, with the cations and anions arranged in a face-centered cubic lattice. Such a structure exhibits two different antiferromagnetic orders. The transition metals can be anti-ferromagnetically arranged in the [001] or [111] direction, defined as AFI and AFII order, respectively. MnO and NiO are proven to have an AFII order, with the arrangement of transition metal atoms shown in Fig
4
b. To simplify the calculation, a smaller primitive cell is used. The primitive cell comprises only two transition metal atoms and two oxygen atoms but is still capable of describing the AFII order. For the sake of consistency, all four TMO’s are partitioned into fragments with the same scheme: For every transition metal atom, its 4s and 3d orbitals, together with the 2s 2p orbitals of a nearby oxygen atom, formed one fragment. Orbitals included in the impurity are shown in Fig.
4
d. This fragmentation scheme includes all the valence orbitals near the Fermi level. Orbitals not included in the impurity fragments are put into a third fragment and are solved with a CCSD solver.

The results of DMET-NNQS simulations are shown in Table
1
. We also include findings from previous research, both experimental and theoretical. DMET-NNQS simulations predict that the stable magnetic order of VO
2
is ferromagnetic, with an energy advantage of 105.54 meV, falling between the DFT-PBE and DFT-LDA+U results. Each V atom is predicted to have a magnetic moment of 1.043
μ
B
, consistent with the DFT-PBE result. Besides the rutile structure, VO
2
has two other monoclinic phases, but we do not delve into this topic here. For MnO and NiO, the DMET-NNQS method correctly predicts the AFII order to be the stable magnetic order. The experimental magnetic moment for MnO ranges from 4.58 to 4.79
μ
B
, and we obtain a slightly higher magnetic moment of 4.866
μ
B
. The calculated energy difference for NiO falls within a reasonable range, and the predicted magnetic moment of NiO is consistent with experimental results. In summary, for all three transition metal oxides, the DMET-NNQS method predicts the correct magnetic order and provides accurate estimations of the energy difference and magnetic moment.

CDW state in 1T-TiSe
2
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties, particularly when reduced to nanosheets or monolayers. Among the extensively studied TMDs, 1T-TiSe
2
stands out as a notable example, experiencing a resurgence in interest. This compound, characterized by a layered structure, exhibits a quasi-two-dimensional nature with Ti octahedrally coordinated by six Se atoms in successive Se-Ti-Se sandwiches. Below a critical temperature of 200 K, 1T-TiSe
2
undergoes a commensurate CDW state with a 2 × 2 × 1 superstructure.
The CDW state is a collective electron phenomenon observed in low-dimensional electronic systems. The CDW state disrupts the original translational symmetry, leading to a periodic redistribution of charge density, commonly referred to as CDW instability. Previous research has revealed the potential origin of the CDW instability of 1T-TiSe
2
36
. As is shown in Fig.
5
, in the band structure of 2 × 2TiSe
2
supercells, the electron and hole pockets are folded at the
Γ
and M points, with no emergence of a gap in the spectrum. The CDW distortion helps open a gap near
E
f
, which helps stabilize the whole system. The CDW state in 1T-TiSe
2
is of particular significance and has garnered much attention, given its intricate connection to superconductivity. Studies have shown that superconductivity can be induced in 1T-TiSe
2
by Cu intercalation or pressure, leading to the suppression of the CDW. This CDW state has been subject to intense theoretical and experimental scrutiny for over three decades. Understanding the properties of the CDW state in 1T-TiSe
2
offers valuable insights into the physics of these intriguing materials and holds promise for diverse applications in electronic devices and beyond.

We employ The DMET-NNQS method to investigate the CDW instability in 1T-TiSe

supercell. Figure

is approximately 3.0, in this simulation,
δ

and
δ

are set to 0.012a and 0.004a respectively. For both normally ordered and distorted structures, a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh is used.
For both structures, the same fragmentation partition scheme is applied. Every Ti atom and every Se atom is treated as a single fragment. For Ti atoms, 3d4s4p orbitals are contained in the fragment, and for Se atoms, 4s4p4d5s5p orbitals form the impurity fragment. Orbitals not defined in the fragments together form the last fragment and are solved with a CCSD solver. Surprisingly, in the Hartree-Fock calculation, which serves as the starting point for the DMET-NNQS method, the CDW instability is not predicted. The normal state exhibits a lower Hartree-Fock energy, with an energy difference of 1.96 meV. However, the CDW instability is predicted by the DMET-NNQS method, with the CDW state exhibiting an energy difference of −18.08 meV compared to the normal state, consistent with the results of previous DFT calculations with GGA exchange potential
36
. The discrepancy in results between HF and DMET-NNQS methods suggests that certain electron correlation is not captured at the HF level. To comprehend the origin of the CDW instability, a detailed analysis of electron occupation or electron density is imperative. In the DMET procedure, 1-particle and 2-particle density matrices are calculated based on wave functions produced by the NNQS solver. These density matrices bring us essential information like electron occupation of orbitals and electron density of the system can be calculated. Figure
5
c illustrates the electron density of 3d electrons for Ti atoms, indicating that undisturbed Ti atoms have fewer 3d electrons, whereas distorted Ti atoms have a higher concentration. Figure
5
d illustrates the electron density above the 1T-TiSe
2
layer, revealing the electron density distribution of Se atoms at the top layer. In contrast to Ti atoms, the undistorted Se atoms exhibit a maximum in electron density, while the distorted ones show a minimum. This pattern of maximum and minimum electron density aligns with the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) figures from previous research
37
. The observed electron density difference for both Ti and Se atoms suggests that as the CDW distortion brings the distorted atoms closer, it strengthens the coupling between Ti 3d orbitals and Se 4p orbitals, potentially serving as a source of CDW instability. The periodic electron density redistribution is successfully captured with the DMET-NNQS method.
Efficiency of transfer learning strategy
In this study, we have carefully designed the transfer learning strategy introduced in the section “Transfer learning strategy in DMET-NNQS”. Learning rates and convergence tolerances are configured separately for transfer and non-transfer scenarios. The model transfer order of two iterations in DMET (named as
μ
iteration and u iteration respectively) is shown as follows:
Where (i,j) refers to the i-th u iteration and j-th
μ
iteration. For the (0,0)-th iteration, the initial learning rate is set to 1.0, and it adjusts to smaller values during the learning process. A convergence criterion of 1 × 10
−6
Hartree is employed. For the subsequent iteration steps that involve transfer learning, the learning rate is set to 3 × 10
−5
, with a convergence tolerance of 1 × 10
−8
Hartree. Figure
6
a illustrates the schematic of such a parameter transfer process and the number of epochs required for convergence in different iteration steps for a DMET-NNQS calculation using the transfer learning strategy. Apart from the first iteration, which requires approximately 8000 epochs to converge, subsequent iteration steps that load the model from the previous iteration only necessitate a few hundred epochs to achieve convergence. In the later stages of the
μ
iteration, the NNQS solver typically only needs tens of epochs.
Fig. 6: The schematics of three different transfer learning scenarios used in this study are presented, along with the corresponding histogram showing the number of epochs required for convergence with the transfer learning strategy.
The neural-network icons represent the NNQS solver and the green arrows indicate the direction to transfer neural-network parameters.

In the DMET iteration process, each
μ
iteration step involves loading the model from the preceding step, and similarly, each u iteration loads the model from the previous step.
b
Transfer learning is applied to embedding Hamiltonians generated by the hydrogen chain with varying H-H distance values.
c
Transfer learning is utilized between similar fragments in bulk diamonds.
Full size image
The transfer learning strategy can also be applied to similar embedding Hamiltonians from different fragments or different chemical systems. For instance, in the computation of the potential energy surface of a one-dimensional hydrogen chain, calculations are performed with varying H-H distances. Although the variations in H-H distance will result in different values of one- and two-body integrals, the structures of the embedding Hamiltonians are only slightly altered, allowing them to be solved with the same NNQS model. Figure
6
b depicts the effectiveness of such a model transfer. By loading the model from a different but similar model, the number of epochs required to converge is reduced from 8000 epochs to no more than 2000 epochs for the initial DMET iteration step. The third transfer learning scenario involves the transfer between similar fragments. For instance, in the calculation of a diamond, two carbon atoms in the unit cell are divided into two different fragments. Since the Hamiltonians for these two fragments are similar, transfer learning can be used. Figure
6
c illustrates the schematic of such a transfer learning process and the efficiency of this strategy.
In summary, the implementation of the transfer learning strategy significantly enhances the efficiency of the DMET-NNQS algorithm, making it several tens of times more efficient. A series of similar structures would require only one single comprehensive NNQS training, significantly reducing the computational cost of solving all the embedding Hamiltonians. The notable increase in efficiency makes it feasible to perform DMET-NNQS calculations on much larger systems.
Performance of DMET-NNQS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the DMET-QiankunNet method. We first compare the DMET-QiankunNet calculation with the direct calculation with the QiankunNet-Solid method
38
to demonstrate the benefit of the quantum embedding method. We use the hydrogen chain with different k-point numbers as an example. The unit cell of the hydrogen chain contains 2 hydrogen atoms, and the H-H distance is fixed to 1.0 Å. We collect the average one-step GPU time for both methods to show their performance. For both methods, the calculations are performed using one NVIDIA A100 GPU. The GPU times are gathered and shown in Table
2
. It is clear that the DMET-QiankunNet method gives a significantly lower time. Because for the hydrogen chain with 2 hydrogen atoms, the QiankunNet method would have to solve a Hamiltonian with 2 × N
k
orbitals, while the DMET-QiankunNet method only needs to solve embedding Hamiltonians with 4 orbitals. In addition to shorter per-step computation times, the DMET-QiankunNet method typically requires significantly fewer steps to achieve convergence.

We have chosen four calculations with characteristic embedding Hamiltonian size and collected their wall times to show the performance of the DMET-QiankunNet method on systems with different sizes. The selected system includes: 1D Hydrogen chain, bulk Diamond with 2s2p orbitals as impurity orbitals and 2s2p3s3p orbitals included in the impurity respectively, and the ferromagnetic order of NiO. The chosen systems have embedding Hamiltonians with 8,16,24,40 spin-orbitals respectively. The time cost of the QiankunNet solver and the total time is listed in Table
3
. The results show that the QiankunNet solver takes most of the time. Time cost besides the QiankunNet solver is mainly the calculation of the two-particle reduced density matrices (2-RDM). The scaling of 2-RDM is
\(O({N}_{u}^{2}{N}_{o})\)
, so for large systems with numerous unique samples, the computation of the 2-RDM also consumes a significant amount of time. However, for the experiments conducted in this work, the majority of computation time is still dominated by the QiankunNet solver.

Discussion
This study introduces an innovative NNQS approach for simulating solid-state materials. Utilizing the DMET method and partitioning at the orbital level, we demonstrate the feasibility of ab initio NNQS simulations for complex electronic structures. Our approach represents a significant advancement in the NNQS method for strongly correlated solids, especially those containing 3d transition metals. To validate our method’s accuracy, we investigated systems such as the 1D hydrogen chain and cubic diamond, and the strongly correlated electronic structure of transition metal complexes. The agreement of our results with classical approaches and previous studies highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach.
By dividing orbitals into impurity and environment components, the DMET method offers an efficient way to partition a periodic system into fragments, which significantly reduces computational cost. Furthermore, the DMET method provides a viable approach to consider correlations between these fragments. This fragmentation scheme is not only more accurate but also more reasonable compared to direct fragmentation methods such as the fragment molecular orbital (FMO)

method or the many-body expansion (MBE) method
42
,
43
, which often struggle to handle periodic systems effectively. Compared to the extensively developed dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
23
,
24
, DMET offers a similar representation of physics but at significantly lower computational costs. However, it is still challenging for the DMET method to accurately evaluate properties related to excited states, which limits its applicability in certain scenarios.
The current DMET-NNQS method faces size limitations. For large systems, we have two options: increasing the fragment size or partitioning the system into more fragments. However, larger fragments require more memory for the NNQS solver, thus constraining the maximum fragment size to the VRAM of the GPU used. Conversely, partitioning the system into too many fragments complicates the convergence of the DMET algorithm. Overcoming these limitations necessitates further development of the DMET-NNQS method.
The results in this work demonstrate the feasibility of the DMET-NNQS method in dealing with transition metal atoms. Many similar materials are known to exhibit strong electron correlation effects. Looking forward, we plan to apply our method in studying strongly correlated materials, such as high-temperature superconducting cuprates and catalysis, where the accurate treatment of electron correlations is critical. These applications would require an a priori partitioning of active orbitals based on chemical intuition, with systematic expansion of each correlating fragment for convergence of properties of interest.
Methods
In this section, we explain the pivotal steps of the DMET-NNQS method. We begin with a concise introduction to the DMET method. Given the comprehensive coverage of the DMET method for both molecular and periodic systems in prior publications, we will not delve into every detail of the DMET method. In the subsequent section, we will begin by outlining the methodology for solving the Hamiltonian using the NNQS solver. Subsequently, an overarching workflow of the DMET-NNQS method is presented, providing a comprehensive overview and introducing the transfer learning strategy in the DMET-NNQS method. Further elaboration and in-depth discussion will follow, offering detailed insights.
Quantum chemistry Hamiltonians
The primary objective of ab initio quantum chemistry calculation is to solve the static Schrödinger equation
\(H\left\vert \Psi \right\rangle =E\left\vert \Psi \right\rangle\)
to get the ground state
\(\left\vert \Psi \right\rangle\)
and the ground-state energy
E
of the many-body interacting Hamiltonian:
$$\hat{H}=-\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{2}{\nabla }_{i}^{2}-\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{A=1}^{M}\frac{{Z}_{A}}{| {{\bf{r}}}_{i}-{{\bf{R}}}_{A}| }+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{N}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j > i}^{N}\frac{1}{| {{\bf{r}}}_{i}-{{\bf{r}}}_{j}| }$$
(1)
where
N
,
M
denote the total number of electrons and nuclei,
∇
i
is the single particle kinetic operator of the
i
-th electron,
r
i
indicates the electronic coordinates,
R
A
and
Z
A
indicate the coordinates and charges of the
A
-th nucleus in the molecule. As shown in ref.
13
, we have transformed the Hamiltonian in Eq. (
1
) into many-spin Hamiltonian
\(H=\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{N}_{h}}{c}_{i}{P}_{i}\)
, where each
P
i
is the tensor product of Pauli spin operators {
I
,
σ
x
,
σ
y
, σ
z
} of length
N
, referred to as a Pauli string, and
c
i
is a real coefficient.
N
h
denotes the total number of Pauli strings. For quantum chemistry Hamiltonians,
N
h
often scales as
O
(
N
4
), which means that for each input bitstring
x
, there could exist
\(O({N}^{4})\,{\bf{x}}^{\prime}\)
s with nonzero
\({H}_{{\bf{x}}{\bf{x}}^{\prime} }\)
. As a result for large
N
, evaluating the local energy can be very expensive, and storing all the
\({\bf{x}}^{\prime}\)
s that are nontrivially coupled to
x
could use a large amount of memory, we have proposed an efficient scheme for the local energy calculation with a highly compressed data structure for the Hamiltonian together with a fused design of nonzero Hamiltonian entry evaluation and local energy calculation

Density matrix embedding theory
The density matrix embedding theory (DMET) assesses the interaction between the impurity and the environment using the density matrix. Once the impurity is identified, the DMET method focuses on the off-diagonal part of the density matrix, which contains information about the interaction between the impurity orbitals and environment orbitals. Specifically, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to the off-diagonal segment of the density matrix, denoted as
D
I
J
:
$${D}_{IJ}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\kappa }^{{d}_{\kappa }}{{\bf{U}}}_{I\kappa }{\lambda }_{\kappa }{{\bf{V}}}_{\kappa J}^{\dagger },I\in env,J\in imp$$
(2)
I is subscript for environmental orbitals and J is subscript for impurity orbitals. SVD result gives the diagonal matrix of singular values
λ
κ
, the number of singular values is denoted as
N
κ
. Leveraging the outcomes of SVD, the extensive environment can be condensed to a set of merely
N
κ
virtual orbitals, denoted as the bath orbitals.
U
I
κ
in Eq. (
2
) is exactly the transformation matrix from environment to bath orbitals. The SVD result of the density matrix forms the core of the DMET algorithm.
In practice, the DMET algorithm for a periodic system starts with the mean-field calculation of the system, usually a Hartree-Fock or a DFT calculation, yielding Bloch wave functions. Considering the preference for performing the DMET method in a localized real space basis, it is imperative to conduct the localization of Bloch wave functions. In this work, we employ intrinsic atomic orbitals for this purpose. Following this, it is imperative to identify the impurity and the environment or partition the localized orbitals into fragments. When concentrating on a specific fragment, orbitals in other fragments collectively constitute the environment. For each fragment impurity, SVD (Eq. (
2
)) is applied to the density matrix on a localized basis. The outcome of this process provides the transformation matrix
C
from localized orbitals to bath orbitals:
$${C}^{{\rm{LO}},{\rm{bath}}}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}{\bf{I}}&{\bf{0}}\\ {\bf{0}}&{{\bf{U}}}_{I,\kappa }\end{array}\right]$$
(3)
Where the impurity part remains the same and the environment orbitals are reduced to
N
κ
bath orbitals with
U
I
,
κ
. Based on mean-field results and the transformation matrix, the embedding Hamiltonian can be constructed (detailed information can be found in ref.
30
):
$${\hat{H}}_{{\rm{emb}}}=\sum _{pq}{h}_{pq}{a}_{p}^{\dagger }{a}_{q}+\sum _{pqrs}{v}_{qs}^{pr}{a}_{p}^{\dagger }{a}_{r}^{\dagger }{a}_{s}{a}_{q}$$
(4)
Here,
h
p
q
and
\({v}_{qs}^{pr}\)
are one- and two-electron integrals.
a
†
and
a
are the creation and annihilation operators.
p
,
q
,
r
,
s
are subscripts for embedding orbitals. The embedding Hamiltonians for all fragments are subsequently solved with the NNQS solver, yielding the ground-state wave function, from which the 1-particle and 2-particle reduced density matrices are computed. Information from all fragments is amalgamated to construct a comprehensive picture.
To ensure self-consistency, the DMET algorithm undergoes two iterations. The first iteration focuses on electron number convergence, which ensures the total electron number aligns with the original electron number in the system. To achieve this, an additional global potential is introduced into the embedding Hamiltonian:
$${\hat{H}}_{new}^{{\rm{emb}}}\leftarrow {\hat{H}}_{old}^{{\rm{emb}}}-\mu \sum {\hat{a}}_{p}^{\dagger }{\hat{a}}_{p}$$
(5)
The global potential
μ
is induced as an extra one-electron term in the embedding Hamiltonian. By adjusting the value of the global potential, the algorithm seeks to find the optimal value that achieves electron number convergence. This iteration is referred to as
μ
iteration in the following paper. The second iteration is employed to enhance the self-consistent construction of the bath orbitals. This is achieved by updating the Fock operator in the mean-field calculation with a correlation potential u. A lost function is used to optimize a better correlation potential u by minimizing the matrix norm between the mean-field density matrix
\({D}_{pq}^{{\rm{mf}}}(u)\)
and the one-particle density matrix solved with NNQS solver
\({D}_{pq}^{{\rm{NN}}}\)
.
$$min \sum _{pq}{\left[{{D}^{mf}_{pq}}(u)-{{D}^{NN}_{pq}}\right]}^{2}$$
(6)
Such an iteration improves the result of the mean-field calculation and refines the construction of bath orbitals. The second iteration is identified as the u iteration below. Upon the completion of the self-consistent iterations, the physical properties of interest can be obtained.
QiankunNet: the NNQS method based on transformer architecture
In our previous work
13
, a transformer-based neural-network architecture (QiankunNet) was used as the variational ansatz to directly solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation under the second quantized formalism, which significantly improves the accuracy of first-principles calculations compared to existing Fermionic ansatz.
Using QiankunNet as a representation for the ground state, expressed as
\(\vert {\psi }_{\vec{\theta}}\rangle\)
, where
\({\vec{\theta}}\)
signifies the parameters undergoing optimization, the system’s energy can be articulated as a function dependent on
\({\vec{\theta}}\)
. In the second quantized formalism, with a basis set (single-electron quantum states or spin-orbitals) introduced, the many-electron wave function can be written as a linear combination of configurations
$$\vert {\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}\rangle =\mathop{\sum}\limits_{{\rm{x}}}\langle {\bf{x}}| {\psi }_{\vec{\theta}}\rangle \vert {\bf{x}}\rangle =\mathop{\sum}\limits_{{\rm{x}}}{\psi }_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})\vert {\bf{x}}\rangle$$
(7)
where each configuration is represented by an occupation number vector (‘configuration string’)
\(\vert {\bf{x}}\rangle =\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},\ldots {x}_{N}\}\)
with
x
i
∈
{0, 1} denoting whether the i-th spin orbital is occupied or not, then we have,
$$\begin{array}{ll}E(\vec{\theta })=\frac{\langle {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}| H| {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}\rangle }{\langle {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}| {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}\rangle }=\frac{{\sum }_{{\bf{x}},{\bf{x}}^{\prime} }\langle {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}| {\bf{x}}\rangle \langle {\bf{x}}| H| {\bf{x}}^{\prime} \rangle \langle {\bf{x}}^{\prime} | {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}\rangle }{{\sum }_{{\bf{y}}}\langle {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}| {\bf{y}}\rangle \langle {\bf{y}}| {\psi }_{\vec{\theta }}\rangle }\\ \qquad\;\;\;\;=\frac{{\sum }_{{\rm{x}}}{E}_{loc}({\bf{x}}){p}_{\vec{\theta }}({\bf{x}})}{{\sum }_{{\bf{y}}}{p}_{\vec{\theta }}({\bf{y}})}={{\mathbb{E}}}_{p}[{E}_{loc}({\bf{x}})]\end{array}$$
(8)
Here,
x,
\({\bf{x}}^{\prime}\)
, and
y
represent distinct bitstrings. In the second line of Eq. (
8
), the concept of local energy, denoted as
E
l
o
c
(
x
), is established as:
$${E}_{loc}({\bf{x}})=\mathop{\sum}\limits_{{\bf{x}}^{\prime}}{H}_{{\bf{x}}{\bf{x}}^{\prime} }{\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}}^{\prime})/{\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})$$
(9)
In this context,
\({H}_{{\bf{x}}{\bf{x}}^{\prime} }=\langle {\bf{x}}| H| {\bf{x}}^{\prime} \rangle\)
signifies the matrix element, and
\({\psi }_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})=\langle {\bf{x}}| {\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}\rangle\)
represents the probability amplitude for the wave function hypothesis
\(\vert{\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}\rangle\)
in the
\(\vert {\bf{x}}\rangle\)
basis. Additionally, the expression
\({p}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})=| {\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}}){| }^{2}\)
is used to denote the probability.
Accurately calculating Eq. (
8
) is typically unfeasible due to the vast, exponentially large set of varying bitstrings. Nevertheless, an approximate assessment of Eq. (
8
) can be achieved by drawing samples from the probability distribution
\({p}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})\)
, thereby acquiring a collection of
N
s
samples, labeled as
\(\{{{\bf{x}}}^{1},{{\bf{x}}}^{2},\ldots ,{{\bf{x}}}^{{N}_{s}}\}\)
, followed by their subsequent averaging:
$$\tilde{E}({\vec{\theta}})=\frac{1}{{N}_{s}}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i=1}^{{N}_{s}}{E}_{loc}({{\bf{x}}}^{i})$$
(10)
In this instance,
\(\tilde{E}({\vec{\theta}})\)
is employed rather than
\(E({\vec{\theta}})\)
to underscore that it is merely an estimation of the actual value. Consequently, if one can effectively draw samples from
\({p}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})\)
(feasible when
\({\psi}_{\vec{\theta}}({\bf{x}})\)
can be efficiently calculated for each
x
), and identify those significant
\({H}_{{\bf{x}}{\bf{x}}^{\prime} }\)
values along with corresponding
\({\bf{x}}^{\prime}\)
, then a more efficient evaluation of Eq. (
8
) is achievable. Employing a gradient-based optimizer can expedite these calculations compared to methods that don’t use gradients. Using the gathered samples, it is possible to estimate the gradient of Eq. (
8
) through automatic differentiation, as suggested in
16
:
$$\begin{array}{l}{\nabla }_{\vec{\theta}}\tilde{E}=2{\rm{Re}}\left({{\mathbb{E}}}_{p}\left[\left({E}_{loc}({\bf{x}})\right.\right.\right.\\\qquad\;\left.\left.\left.-\,{{\mathbb{E}}}_{p}\left[{E}_{loc}({\bf{x}})\right]\right){\nabla}_{\vec{\theta}}\ln \left({\Psi }_{\vec{\theta}}^{*}({\bf{x}})\right)\right]\right)\end{array}$$
(11)
In a comparable manner,
\({\nabla}_{\vec{\theta}}\tilde{E}\)
serves as an approximation for the precise gradient
\({\nabla}_{\vec{\theta}}E\)
. Subsequent to this, the parameters
\({\vec{\theta}}\)
are updated using
\({\nabla}_{\vec{\theta}}\tilde{E}\)
in conjunction with the optimizer, culminating in the completion of a single cycle of the variational Monte Carlo algorithm (VMC).
Transfer learning strategy in DMET-NNQS
The comprehensive workflow of the DMET-NNQS method is depicted in Fig.
7
. As indicated in the figure, the DMET algorithm generates a series of embedding Hamiltonians tailored to a specific system. These embedding Hamiltonians are solved using the NNQS solver, yielding the ground-state energies and wave functions. The wave functions then generate one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices, which are crucial components for the two self-consistent iterations in the DMET method. The iteration continues until a specified convergence criterion is achieved.

Yellow boxes indicate information exchange between them.
Full size image
A significant problem in the entire DMET-NNQS process is that the two iterations of DMET produce numerous embedding Hamiltonians for the NNQS solver, leading to a substantial increase in computational time for the entire algorithm. Our observation indicates that the two iteration processes do not result in substantial modifications to the one- and two-body integrals in the Hamiltonian, suggesting that all Hamiltonians in the iteration share similar structures. As a result, the parameters for generating the ground state wave function in neural networks are not expected to differ significantly. Our analysis further suggests that the neural-network parameters obtained from the previous iteration can serve as ideal initial parameters for the next iteration. Thus the final parameters for each DMET iteration are saved, and in the subsequent DMET iteration, the entire neural network is reconstructed using these saved parameters. Furthermore, considering that the initial parameters (except in the first iteration) require only merely steps toward reaching the optimal parameters, we can set the learning rate of the neural network to a relatively low value. Additionally, more stringent convergence criteria can be imposed. These adjustments contribute to the faster and more accurate convergence of the NNQS solver. Apart from transfer learning within DMET iterations, transfer learning can significantly enhance efficiency whenever Hamiltonians exhibit a certain degree of similarity. For instance, this applies to Hamiltonians derived from various fragments or even different systems, provided that the orbitals within these fragments share similar structural characteristics. The utilization of transfer learning significantly enhances the algorithm’s efficiency, and detailed results are presented in the section “Efficiency of transfer learning strategy”.
Implementation and computational details
In this work, we used QiankunNet as the NNQS solver and developed an interface to the libdmet code developed by Cui et al.
30
. We followed the general workflow provided with libdmet and made necessary modifications to the code. All mean-field calculations in this work were conducted using the PySCF package
44
,
45
, with the Hartree-Fock method in periodic boundary conditions serving as the starting point for DMET iterations. GTH pseudo-potentials were used to replace core electrons, and corresponding GTH basis sets were utilized. For systems lacking d electrons, the GTH-DZVP basis set was applied, whereas the GTH-DZVP-MOLOPT-SR basis set was used for systems containing d electrons. The two-electron integrals were computed using the GDF module in PySCF. In all DMET calculations, the intrinsic atomic orbital (IAO) method was employed as the localization method. Classical quantum chemistry methods such as CC and CI were also implemented using the PySCF package.
We compiled the NNQS transformer using a hybrid of single-precision and double-precision, on the Intel Xeon Scale 8358 CPU and NVIDIA A100 PCIe 80 GB. Pytorch 1.13 was used, which has been deeply integrated with the underlying runtime and computing libraries.

Abstract
Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provide detailed information about bonding, distributions and locations of atoms, and their coordination numbers and oxidation states. However, analysis of XAS/EELS data often relies on matching an unknown experimental sample to a series of simulated or experimental standard samples. This limits analysis throughput and the ability to extract quantitative information from a sample. In this work, we have trained a random forest model capable of predicting the oxidation state of copper based on its L-edge spectrum. Our model attains an
R
2
score of 0.85 and a root mean square error of 0.24 on simulated data. It has also successfully predicted experimental L-edge EELS spectra taken in this work and XAS spectra extracted from the literature. We further demonstrate the utility of this model by predicting simulated and experimental spectra of mixed valence samples generated by this work. This model can be integrated into a real-time EELS/XAS analysis pipeline on mixtures of copper-containing materials of unknown composition and oxidation state. By expanding the training data, this methodology can be extended to data-driven spectral analysis of a broad range of materials.

Introduction
Due to their wide range of accessible oxidation states and materials applications, the ability to determine the oxidation state of third-row transition metals is essential to a wide variety of applications. These include the development of catalysts
1
, photovoltaic devices
2
, and biotechnology
3
. Core level spectroscopy is often used to probe transition metal oxidation states, and two main types are electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). EELS provides detailed atomic scale information, such as oxidation state, coordination number, and local symmetry of a nanomaterial
4
,
5
. When probing nanomaterials, EELS is often combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). In STEM-EELS, an electron beam is scanned over an area of a sample and a full spectrum is acquired and stored at each probe position. This technique is particularly valuable in the study of nanomaterials due to its combination of high spatial and high energy resolution
6
,
7
,
8
. Like EELS, XAS has also attained wide usage in determining oxidation state and local environment in nanomaterials
9
,
10
,
11
. XAS, however, is typically limited to a spatial resolution of a few nanometers
12
, rather than the sub angstrom spatial resolution possible with STEM-EELS
13
. The main advantages of XAS compared to EELS for core-loss spectroscopy are the ability to attain higher signal to noise ratios (SNR) and higher energy resolution, particularly at higher excitation energies
14
, and functionality on thicker samples for hard x-ray excitation
15
. Due to the myriad use cases for both techniques, they are commonly applied to the nanoscale study of materials containing third row transition metals. However, since EELS and XAS spectra encode the electronic properties of the sample in an abstract way, extracting physical descriptors is a non-trivial task in spectral analysis.
Therefore, quantitative spectral analysis is often the rate limiting step in materials characterization, and can typically only be conducted by trained experts. This is especially true of L-edge spectra of transition metals, where variations in oxidation state can manifest in small shifts in edge location, L
2
/L
3
ratio and peak width that are not immediately obvious to a non expert, particularly for samples containing multiple oxidation states
16
. Oxidation state assignment is typically done by mapping the unknown spectrum to known experimental or simulated standards, a process which can be time intensive and requires significant domain knowledge. Particularly challenging to analyze are mixed valence materials, which are often interpreted as combinations of spectra of integer valence structures
17
. The prevailing solution to this problem is to fit integer valence spectra to the unknown spectrum using least squares. This allows a user to input known standards and determine the coefficients of a linear combination of the standard spectra that reproduce the experimental spectrum
17
,

.
Least squares fitting has allowed quantitative oxidation state analysis of mixed valence samples and is widely implemented as the state-of-the-art procedure for quantitative analysis of unlabeled XAS/EELS L-edge data. However, in the case of experimental standards, it has a few serious limitations. First, this procedure requires fresh standards to be taken for each instrument, and often each day, as changes in detector setup and alignment can lead to non trivial changes in the spectra. Second, this procedure is highly sensitive to experimental variation in the acquisition of the standard samples. Contamination with materials of other oxidation state, surface oxidation and beam damage can have a significant impact on the shape of the standard spectrum, and therefore interfere with the fitting of the unknown sample. Additionally, inconsistencies in standard spectrum processing, such as baseline subtraction or the incomplete deconvolution of multiple scattering from the standard sample, can have a similar impact. Third, the presence of any oxidation state or coordination environment unaccounted for by the standards will not only be missed by the prediction of the makeup of the material, potentially missing an important fundamental discovery, but will also lead to an inaccurate representation of the oxidation state as the standard components are forced to represent a signal not originating from any of them. In a similar vein, experimental standards must be taken for every material expected to be present in order to perform the oxidation state analysis. For example, a standard for CuO may not be suitable for an experiment involving CuS due to non trivial differences between the spectra, although they are both a Cu(II) oxidation state
21
,
22
. Simulated standards suffer from fewer experimental limitations, but instead are limited by the level of approximations used in the theory and often can not perfectly reproduce experimental spectra. This can cause systematic errors leading to significant misidentifications, particularly when applied to noisy experimental spectra or experimental spectra more challenging to simulate. It is rare for simulated standards for L-edge transition metal spectra to be quantitatively accurate enough to fit an unknown experimental spectrum using least squares fitting
23
. Instead, these are used to qualitatively match components of an unknown spectrum. Therefore, there is a need for a procedure that can determine oxidation state from XAS/EELS L-edge data that is more robust than the least squares fitting of a handful of standard spectra.
An avenue for a more broadly applicable automated analysis procedure is machine learning (ML). Despite some recent advancements in automated L-edge XAS/EELS analysis of transition metals using ML approaches
24
, overall, the transition metal K-edge has received more focus from the ML community
25
,
26
,
27
. Numerical analysis of L-edge transition metal XAS/EELS data has mainly been performed using principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the spectrum. This field has been well developed, comprising numerous applications of PCA on L-edge XAS/EELS data
28
,
29
,
30
,
31
. Additionally, PCA dimensionality reduction procedures have been used to successfully de-noise low SNR core loss EELS data
32
,
33
,
34
. PCA has also been extended into analysis of oxidation states. Applying component analysis to a mixed valence XAS/EELS spectrum can result in components that mimic the unique oxidation states present. This can be used as a qualitative estimation of the different oxidation states present in a sample, however, it is difficult to ensure each of the resulting components match the pure form of an oxidation state. Therefore, the lack of rigorous physical interpretation of the components makes any quantitative analysis challenging
35
.
Supervised machine learning approaches have found success predicting oxidation states in manganese and iron samples, using neural networks and support vector machines
36
,
37
,
38
. However, these models were trained on a small subset of materials and, with the exception of ref.
37
on Mn spectra, only focused on integer valence states. Therefore, the more complicated question of L-edge spectra oxidation state regression of an arbitrary Cu material containing a wide range of oxidation states has not been thoroughly explored. The lack of focus on mixed valence structures generally is especially notable, as such a model is necessary to analyze an in-situ experiment where 1000s of spectra are generated quickly with minor variations in oxidation state.
This work has developed a supervised ML model capable of conducting a regression task on an unlabeled Cu L
2,3
-edge XAS/EELS spectrum and predicting the average oxidation state. An outline of this model is shown in Fig.
1
. The L
2,3
-edge was selected as the focus due to the prohibitively high energy of the transition metal K-edge for electron detectors. We utilized the simulated L-edge XAS spectra of transition metals stored in the Materials Project
39
,
40
as a seed to construct our training set. Despite the differing physical origins of XAS vs EELS, with XAS caused by excitation from a photon and EELS by an electron, under the long wave-length limit and dipole approximation, both spectroscopic methods involve evaluating the same transition matrix element. Therefore, a model trained on XAS data is able to effectively predict EELS data

d
bands in Cu(II), where the many-body effects, such as multiplet effects, require higher levels of theory beyond the mean-field level
23
,
46
. This can produce some spurious artifacts in the simulations, such as the L
3
shoulder in the CuO simulation (Fig.
S1c
) which is not present in the experimental sample. Although the quadrupole contribution can play an important role in pre-edge features, distinct spectral features in the main edge regions are found to be sensitive to the oxidation state from feature importance analysis. Therefore, neglecting the quadrupole contribution will not have a significant impact in this analysis. The overall success of FEFF9 in producing Cu L-edge spectra allows Cu materials to serve as a model system for this type of automated analysis procedure. In this work we present a framework for predicting the Cu oxidation state that can be readily extended to other transition metals by acquiring a volume of corresponding simulated XAS data.
Results
Performance on simulated spectra
Our RF model shows a high level of accuracy on a test set of simulated data. Figure
2
a shows the
R
2
plot of the predictions of this test set, which contains roughly 2400 spectra. The
R
2
for this model is 0.85, and shows a visible high degree of correlation across all the well represented oxidation states. The largest errors come from integer valence misprediction, most commonly when a Cu(0) or Cu(I) spectrum is predicted as mixed valence. However, as shown in Fig.
2
a, these mispredictions can often be differentiated from the accurate predictions by using the prediction standard deviation (described in the methods section). The feature importance plot from Fig.
2
c offers insights into the origin of these errors. The model takes a small amount of information from the pre-edge and then bases its prediction mostly on the location and shape of the L
3
peak. As Cu(0) and Cu(I) have L
3
peaks at almost exactly the same energy, these are harder to differentiate than Cu(II), which is red shifted by roughly 3 eV. Despite this difficulty, Cu(0) and Cu(I) are accurately identified far more often than they are mispredicted, as shown in Fig.
2
a. As can be seen from Fig.
2
b, a full integer miss, i.e. a Cu(0) spectrum incorrectly called a Cu(I) spectrum, essentially never occurs. Additionally, as shown in Fig.
2
a, b, the simulated mixture samples are frequently predicted with a high degree of accuracy, showing this model has significant potential in predicting mixed valence samples.

Model uncertainty metric
In this work, we have developed a method for quantifying the uncertainty in our RF model’s prediction. This is done by examining the predictions of each of the 500 decision trees which comprise the random forest as well as the averaged value used as the final prediction. This uncertainty analysis is visualized by generating a prediction histogram, as shown in Figs.
1
(IV) and
3
d–f. Beyond the qualitative spread of predictions shown in the prediction histograms, the uncertainty can be understood quantitatively by calculating the standard deviation of these predictions. This is indicated by the horizontal green line in the prediction histogram plots shown in Figs.
1
and
3
, and is used here as the RF model’s internal uncertainty measurement. To leverage this quantitative uncertainty, the standard deviation can be used to filter out predictions that are highly uncertain, and therefore presumably less accurate. Figure
S2
illustrates this concept, where a standard deviation threshold was imposed, and all predictions with a standard deviation higher than this value were discarded due to their high uncertainty. The standard deviation can be used as a powerful tool in determining significantly inaccurate predictions on simulated data, as can be seen when the threshold is set at 0.35 (red rectangle in Fig.
S2a
,
b
). When this threshold is used, 15% of the predictions of our test set are higher than the threshold and discarded (Fig.
S2a
). However, imposing this threshold causes the RMSE of the remaining 85% of our test set to decrease 8% from the full test set value of 0.24 to 0.22 (Fig.
S2b
). Therefore, the 15% of the test set discarded by this method is comprised of predictions less accurate than average, showcasing the utility of this uncertainty metric in informing the accuracy of the model’s predictions for unknown samples.

Validation using experimental spectra
To test the RF model’s validity when applied to experiments, we used it to predict a set of metallic Cu and Cu oxide EELS standards taken with our home instrument as well as a series of XAS spectra extracted from the literature. The simulated spectra corresponding to the EELS standards were left out of both the training and test sets previously discussed, to simulate a situation where the model is being applied to previously unseen materials. These standards were smoothed using a Savitzy-Golay filter with a window size of 1.5 eV and a polynomial order of 3. From Fig.
S3
it can be seen that the level of smoothing does not impact prediction accuracy. The smoothing window of 1.5 eV was selected as the default method due to qualitative observations that it removed the vast majority of the noise but also preserved the overall shape of the spectrum (Fig.
S4
). From Fig.
3
e, f it can be seen that the model has a high degree of accuracy when predicting Cu(I) and Cu(II), rendering essentially perfect predictions for each of these standards, regardless of whether the mean or the median of the decision tree ensemble is used as the prediction. However, Fig.
3
d shows the Cu(0) standard appears to be slightly over estimated, with the mean prediction rendering a larger overestimate than the median, as the two predict 0.3 and 0.05, respectively.
There are likely two factors responsible for the overprediction of Cu valence for metallic absorbers. First, as has been discussed above, random forest models average predictions across individual decision trees, in this case 500. Therefore, it will always be more challenging for this model to predict Cu(0) as exactly zero, as all Cu atoms in our training data have non-negative valence. Consequently, any spread in the predictions will result in an overestimate. It is also worth noting that Fig.
3
d shows that the mode of our prediction histogram contains Cu(0) by a factor of four over the next highest bar, and that the median is much closer to a prediction of Cu(0). A second factor may also partially explain this overestimate, which is that our Cu(0) likely experienced some surface oxidation. Therefore, it may be assumed that this material no longer had a true oxidation state of zero at the time of measurement. This is reflected in the spectrum, which can be seen to have visibly taken on some additional Cu(I) character relative to simulated Cu(0) and Cu(0) observed in XAS studies taken from the literature (Figure
S5
,
21
). Specifically, our Cu(0) spectrum shows a drop in intensity of the two higher energy peaks in the L
3
edge and an increase in intensity in the lowest energy peak, which are characteristic of surface oxidation leading to more visible Cu(I) character. This, combined with the logistics surrounding the attainment of our Cu(0) sample, the sample was not shipped in vacuum-sealed vial, and the fact that we were unable to reduce the sample in the microscope, supports the supposition that our Cu(0) EELS sample has undergone some surface oxidation. Therefore, we believe that this prediction of a mixed valence material closer to Cu(0) than Cu(I) matches our experimental realities and a detailed examination of the experimental spectrum.
However, it is also important to note that an XAS spectrum of Cu(0) extracted from the literature (Fig.
4
d) is also overestimated by our model. This is unlikely to be a result of surface oxidation, both from an instrumental perspective and a qualitative examination of the spectrum, which shows a much more characteristic Cu(0) sample than our experimental EELS sample due to the relatively equal heights of the three L
3
edge peaks and the L
3
being lower in intensity than the L
2
edge (Figs.
S1
and
S5
). We attribute the overestimation of the literature Cu(0) mainly to the fact that our model does not allow for non-positive predictions, which causes any uncertainty in the prediction of Cu(0) to result in an overestimate, as discussed above.

In addition to the experimental spectra predicted in Figs.
3
,
4
, 8 other spectra extracted from the literature were predicted using this model (Figs.
S6
and
S7
)
47
,
48
,
49
. 7 of these 8 spectra were materials with a Cu(I) oxidation state and all are predicted to within 0.1 of Cu(I) when the edge alignment is correct, and most retain their accuracy when the edge is misaligned by 0.5 eV in either direction (Figure
S7
). The one Cu(II) material, CuS, is predicted as roughly 1.5. However, our model’s prediction is likely inaccurate due to this spectrum’s high intensity post the L
3
region (Fig.
S8
). As the Cu(II) L
3
edge is roughly 2eV lower in energy than Cu(I) and Cu(0), this increased intensity is likely mimicking a mixed valent spectrum, with this extra intensity appearing to come from absorption from a Cu(I) material. XAS is impacted by multiple photon scattering in very thick samples, which produces artificially high intensity in the tail of the L
2,3
edge spectrum. Therefore, we believe that this was simply a spectrum of a very thick sample, leading to multiple scattering-induced changes to the spectrum that the model is unable to account for.
Energy axis misalignment
Given that we have performed a manual edge alignment correction to our training data, we also examine the impact of energy axis misalignment on our predictions of experimental spectra. To explore this, we created a set of experimental spectra where the onset energy was shifted by controlled amounts and tracked how this shift impacted the oxidation state prediction (Fig.
4
). From Fig.
4
a we see that the energy misalignment has the greatest impact on the Cu(0) sample, and an offset of −0.4 eV or greater causes an inflection point where the prediction jumps from 0.3 to nearly 0.5. Misalignment in the positive direction has a far less dramatic impact, and an energy shift of +0.5 eV produces essentially no change in the prediction. The Cu(I) sample, shown in Fig.
4
b, is more stable, with a shift of nearly 1 eV in either direction resulting in a change of <0.2 in the oxidation state prediction. In Fig.
4
c, we see that Cu(II)’s prediction is virtually independent of shift plus/minus 1 eV, which is likely explained by the >2 eV gap between the onset energy of Cu(II) vs Cu(I) and Cu(0).
To further examine the utility of our model when applied to experimental spectra, and to further study the impact of absolute energy shift, an additional experimental validation was done using an extracted set of XAS spectra of Cu oxides
21
. This set of spectra has been measured to be shifted from the experimental spectra used to validate this model by −1.0 eV for the Cu metal spectrum and −1.2 eV for the Cu
2
O and CuO spectra (Figs.
S1
and
S5
), and provides a test case for how the model will respond to spectra with their energy axes significantly misaligned. From Fig.
4
d–f, we can see that our ML model produces excellent results for the XAS spectra when they are correctly aligned to our training data (red line in Fig.
4
d–f) and the results are robust even when the raw spectra are predicted, which are severely misaligned (black line in Fig.
4
d–f). When such a misalignment has occurred, the Cu(I) and Cu(II) spectra are predicted with near perfect accuracy, while the Cu(0) spectrum appears to be slightly over estimated, returning a prediction of around 0.5 when the correct alignment prediction is 0.28. It is worth reflecting that this prediction is still an overestimate, although closer to zero than our experimental EELS spectrum shown in Fig.
3
d, reflecting this model’s propensity to overestimate Cu(0). With these observations, it is clear that the ML model trained on properly aligned spectra can achieve highly accurate results on spectra with significant energy misalignment. Additionally, a potential avenue to determine the true alignment location is to vary the energy axis and seek out regions of consistent stability and low prediction standard deviation, as these regions are often associated with more accurate predictions for our experimental data.
Prediction of experimental mixed valence samples
Post successful proof of concept for our model on standard experimental samples, we turn our attention to a more valuable, but also more challenging, experimental case, the prediction of samples of mixtures of different oxidation states. As shown in Fig.
2
a, our model has already demonstrated a high degree of accuracy on simulated mixed valence samples. Additionally, we show how smooth variance in simulated mixed valence materials excluded from the training data is captured by our model by showing simulated mixtures of Cu(0), Cu(I), and Cu(II) in Fig.
S9
. The important test for the utility of this model in experimental spectra is how well this process works on experimental mixtures of oxidation states. Due to the difficulty in engineering a system with smoothly varying mixed valence states, and inherent uncertainties in quantifying such a system, we have generated mixed valence experimental spectra through linear combinations of our standard samples. The labeled value for these experimental mixtures is determined by multiplying their formal oxidation state by their contribution to the final mixture spectrum, as was done with the labeling for the simulated mixtures. For example, a mixture of 40% Cu(0) standard and 60% Cu
2
O standard would be calculated as follows:
$$0.00* 0.4+1.00* 0.6+2.00* 0.0=0.6$$
(1)
The results are shown in Fig.
5
. From Fig.
5
a, b, both plots contain regions of high accuracy, particularly for mixtures of Cu(I) and Cu(II) (Fig.
5
b). Mixtures of Cu(I) and Cu(II) are accurately predicted to within less than 0.1 in close to half of the mixture samples. However, there are also sections of low accuracy, particularly at inflection points where the prediction changes quickly. This is particularly true for mixtures of Cu(0) and Cu(I) (Fig.
5
a), where the inflection region drives the prediction into a region of significant overestimation which is not recovered until the mixture becomes entirely Cu(I). However, in most cases the overall trend of the prediction is correct, as in both Fig.
5
a, b the higher valence sample is frequently identified as such until a pure sample is predicted, regardless of any absolute inaccuracies in the prediction.

) and mixtures of Cu(I) and Cu(II) (

). The scatter plot color corresponds to the prediction’s standard deviation. The dashed line indicates the location of a perfect prediction, while the vertical lines indicate the standard deviation of each prediction. The vertical lines show one standard deviation in the negative and positive direction.
Full size image
Both mixed valence cases tend to overestimate the oxidation state when the higher oxidation state sample comprises greater than 50% of the mixture. We believe this to be a feature of the higher maximum intensity and sharper peaks of higher oxidation state spectra. This can be seen in Fig.
3
a–c, where the edge intensity relative to the tail of each spectrum is shown. This is also noticeable in the cumulative spectrum, which is the actual input into the model, (inset in Fig.
3
a–c) where the lower intensity in the Cu(0) peak results in an almost linear cumulative spectrum, while the higher intensity of Cu(I) and Cu(II) are very noticeable as a sharply increasing region in the L
3
edge region of the cumulative spectrum. The higher intensity of the higher oxidation state may make the fine features of Cu(0) difficult to detect at low mixture fractions, as Cu
2
O and Cu(0) have their onset edges and L
3
peaks at essentially the same energy. Additionally, The slight red shift in Cu(II) spectra yields an immediately noticeable feature for model identification, and a sample which is 75% Cu(II) and 25% Cu(I) may simply be predicted as a Cu(II) with a shoulder or other unusual transition, which is relatively common in the simulated data.
We have also predicted random experimental mixtures of Cu(0), Cu
2
O, and CuO. This was done using mixtures of the literature XAS spectra and our experimental EELS data. The results are shown in Fig.
S10
a, c, respectively. They contain a characteristic overestimation as seen in the smoothly varying mixed valent binary mixtures, which inspired the creation of an empirical correction to random mixed valent spectra. The literature XAS predictions were used to train a linear regression model to predict the true oxidation state based on the prediction of the unknown spectrum. This was done using the mean, median, and standard deviation of the decision trees as input. The model was trained and validated using the random mixtures of the literature XAS data and tested on the predictions of the random mixtures of EELS data. Figure
S10
a, b shows the predictions on the training data, the literature XAS sample, and how the empirical correction improves the predictions. Upon generation of this empirical model, it was used to correct the predictions of mixtures of Cu(0), Cu
2
O, and CuO experimental EELS spectra. The results of applying this correction are shown in Figure
S10
c, d. The generation of this empirical model shows that, despite the challenges of predicting a pure Cu(II) in the empirical model’s predictions, the overall trend of the mixed valent overestimation can be captured and corrected.
Comparison of prediction methods
As Fig.
3
d clearly shows that the median/mode of the decision trees yields a prediction much closer to Cu(0) for our experimental EELS Cu(0) sample, and Fig.
5
shows a characteristic overestimation in both types of experimental mixtures, it is worth exploring whether using the median or the mode as the prediction, rather than the mean, is more accurate overall. This idea is explored in detail in Fig.
S11
, which shows the full prediction histogram for various mixtures of Cu(0) and Cu
2
O (Fig.
S11
a–f) and compares the median, mean, and mode predictions directly (Fig.
S11
g–i). From Fig.
S11
we see that, although the median is more accurate for pure Cu(0), it quickly begins to overestimate the oxidation state by a margin significantly greater than the prediction using the mean of the decision trees. The mode prediction is even more extreme, returning exclusively integer oxidation state predictions, regardless of mixture composition. Therefore, for predictions of mixtures of oxidation states, the mean prediction is more likely to be accurate, and median/mode statistics can be helpful in instances where a pure oxidation state is assumed, particularly if the material is expected to be metallic.
Impact of noise on simulated data
To test the impact of noise on the simulated data, random Poisson noise was added to each simulated spectrum in the test set to produce a test set augmented by noise. To ensure that this process echoed our approach on experimental spectra as much as possible, the simulated spectra, which are on a 0.1 eV resolution, were re-sampled using scipy’s 1d interpolation function with a higher resolution of 0.03 eV, matching that of our experimental samples. Noise was then added to the interpolated spectra, and these spectra were then smoothed in the same method as the experimental spectra and integrated to produce a cumulative spectrum (Fig.
S4
). These spectra were then predicted by the model to test its accuracy on noisy data.
As shown in Fig.
6
a, the simulated data are relatively sensitive to noise augmentation, and the addition of a small amount of Poisson noise resulted in an increase in RMSE from 0.24 to 0.3 as compared to results from the noiseless spectra. Further increase in noise led to an even larger RMSE, however the decline in accuracy becomes less sharp than the initial slope. A similar trend is seen in Fig.
6
b for
R
2
, where a drop in
R
2
is observed after adding a small amount of noise. However, this decline is less sharp than the increase in RMSE, and adding additional noise has a more pronounced effect on
R
2
than subsequent noise does on RMSE. Despite this observation, our experimental spectra, which have a higher volume of noise than the simulated low noise case, do not appear to be as affected by noise as the simulated noisy spectra (Fig.
3
). An examination of the quantitative noise level of the experimental spectra can be found in Fig.
S12
, which shows that the noise STD for the experimental EELS spectra is between 0.03 and 0.05. Additionally, the selection of the random seed for the addition of noise appears to have a significant impact on the overall accuracy of the noisy test set. This is shown with the error bars in Fig.
6
a, b, which represent the standard deviation across 100 different random noise seed states. The presented RMSEs and
R
2
s are the average values across these 100 random states. A detailed examination of the noise profiles for these higher error random states shows that in these spectra the region around the baseline experiences noise spikes that mimic features around the baseline region, similar to how an inaccurate power law subtraction of an EELS spectrum baseline appears. This observation further emphasizes that the accuracy of this model relies heavily on the accurate identification and subtraction of the baseline.

Discussion
In this work, we have built a random forest model trained on simulated L-edge XAS spectra which is capable of predicting the oxidation state of copper based on its L-edge XAS/EELS spectrum. We have also developed a database of simulated Cu XAS spectra containing 3500 unique materials that have been accurately aligned to experimental spectra, and augmented this database with 6000 simulated mixture spectra. Our random forest model attains an
R
2
of 0.85 on simulated data with an RMSE of 0.24 and has been shown to accurately predict experimental spectra taken from our home institution and from the literature. Additionally, this model has proven successful at predicting mixed valence samples, showing its applicability to tracking the oxidation state of Cu during in-situ experiments where oxidation state is changing fluidly. Beyond this model’s utility to Cu materials, we have also developed a broader methodology which can be extended to the analysis of other materials by acquiring a spectral database of accurate simulated L-edge spectra for the corresponding material.
Methods
Training set generation
In this work, simulated FEFF9 XAS spectra of Cu materials were extracted from the Materials Project. This initial extraction produced a dataset of site averaged spectra for 1533 materials, which contains the 59 materials shown in Fig.
1
I labeled as neither predicted stable nor synthesized
39
. To increase the volume of our training data, an additional 2000 structures were selected by searching the Materials Project for all Cu containing materials that had either been previously synthesized or were predicted to be stable by theory
40
. This choice screens a broad material space that is likely accessible to experiments. We computed 2000 site averaged spectra using the
Lightshow
workflow
50
and FEFF9
46
. The combination of this augmentation step and the initial extraction of L-edge spectra already generated by the Materials Project provided 1199 materials that both have been experimentally synthesized and are predicted to be stable (Fig.
1
I). For each structure, unique Cu sites are determined by the space group symmetry. Then site-specific spectra were calculated using FEFF9. The L
2
and L
3
spectra for each site were combined into the L
2
,
3
spectrum by summing the L
2
and L
3
spectra, after first interpolating onto the same energy grid (Figure
S13
). The site averaged spectrum is calculated from the weighted sum of site-specific spectra based on the multiplicity of the unique sites in the unit cell. The oxidation states of the site averaged spectra were determined using the Materials Project’s “average oxidation states” function
40
. Despite this averaging procedure, >93% of the site-averaged spectra retained integer valence. When FEFF9 failed to converge for some, but not all, of the sites in a material, converged site spectra were averaged leaving out the failed spectra.
To prepare our training set of 3500 site averaged spectra, several additional steps were performed. This workflow is summarized in Fig.
1
. First, spectra were interpolated to ensure they were all on a 0.1 eV energy resolution. Second, the non uniformity in the energy range of the L
3
edge, specifically at the starting point, was addressed by fitting a 6th order polynomial to connect the lowest energy point to [925, 0] (i.e., vanishing intensity at 925 eV) for every spectrum (see Figure
S14
). The spectra were then aligned to ensure their onset edges were in the same general energy range as those seen in experimental EELS Cu materials, as it was observed that FEFF9 was producing a systematic misalignment in the absolute energy of the L
2,3
edge.
To accomplish this alignment, two systematic errors were corrected. First, a high degree of onset energy variability was observed across zero valence materials, which would be expected to all have similar onset energies. Second, the absolute energy of the simulated spectra were several eV off from experimental standards. Both of these issues were fixed simultaneously by our automated alignment procedure. Below is a brief summary of our edge alignment procedure following the ΔSCF method
51

are the excitation energies before and after alignment. In order to correct the inaccuracy in the calculated excitation energy, we scale the raw spectrum by the difference between the Fermi energy (

2
O, and CuO, respectively
53
. In principle, one should perform VASP calculations for all the systems in the database. However, this will lead to a very high computational cost, which is impractical for the scope of this study. Therefore, we treated (
ϵ

) as constant for each oxidation state, using the Cu, Cu
2
O, and CuO values listed above for Cu(0), Cu(I), and Cu(II) spectra respectively. This resulted in a simplification of equation (2), where (

, with different values for each oxidation state. These are: 1849.06 eV, 1849.33eV, and 1846.87 eV for Cu with oxidation state of 0, +1, and +2, respectively, which aligns simulated Cu, Cu
2
O, and CuO spectra to their corresponding EELS experimental spectrum. For the small subset of materials that were classified as mixed valence, they were aligned based on whichever integer oxidation state they were closest to.
It is important to note that this alignment procedure is not aligning the edge to the exact location of the Cu/Cu
2
O/CuO edges for all Cu 0, +1, and +2 spectra (i.e. forcing every Cu(II) spectrum to start at 930.2 eV, where the CuO edge is located). This alignment procedure computes a correction based on FEFF9’s Fermi energy prediction and then uses the energy gap between the simulated spectrum of either Cu metal, Cu
2
O, and CuO, post Fermi correction, and the corresponding experimental spectrum to scale all spectra with that oxidation state. For example, not every Cu(II) spectrum is at the same edge energy, and many of them are quite different based on their initial location post Fermi energy correction. The relative energy alignment from FEFF9 within an oxidation state is often preserved, particularly for Cu(I) and Cu(II) materials, and this scaling using the experimental spectra is done to bring the energy axis to experimental relevance. Without this correction, the energy axis for the FEFF9 spectra is misaligned by multiple eV and any experimental prediction is impossible. An example of this alignment procedure is shown in Figure
S15
.
Our spectral dataset was then augmented by generating simulated mixed valence samples (see step III in Figs.
1
and
S16
). To accomplish this, 300 random sets of spectra were drawn from the integer dataset, each draw taking a random Cu(0), Cu(I) and Cu(II) site averaged spectrum. Each of these 300 sets of 3 integer spectra were then linearly combined to mimic mixed valence structures. For each set of three spectra, 20 random fractions of each material were combined to produce a simulated mixed valence spectrum. To ensure an even spread of mixed valences, 100 sets were combinations of Cu(0) and Cu(I), 100 were combinations of Cu(I) and Cu(II), and 100 were combinations of Cu(0), Cu(I) and Cu(II). This mixture produced a final dataset of roughly 9500 spectra with data well distributed from Cu(0) to Cu(II) (step III in Figs.
1
and
S16
). Our training and test sets were generated by separating classes of mixtures, rather than a random 75/25 split across the full 9500 spectra dataset. To accomplish this, we tracked the compositions of each random mixture, and ensured each composition was fully placed in either the training or test set. For example, an arbitrary mixture of Cu(0), Cu(I), and Cu(II) would have 20 random proportions of each material in our full dataset, and our train/test split ensured all 20 of these were either in training or test. This ensures the model is not biased by seeing a 0.3, 0.3, and 0.4 mixture of the above materials in training and then tested on a mixture of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 of the above compounds, which results in a very similar spectrum.
To achieve the best ML model performance, we have tested different spectral representations, including the spectrum itself, its first and second derivative, and the cumulative integral of the spectrum. We found that the best model performance was achieved with the cumulative integral with intensity normalized to 1. In addition, using the cumulative integral, referred to as a cumulative spectrum in this work, as input feature can ensure consistency in the absolute scale of the EELS spectrum. This representation can simplify intensity scaling, as experimental post processing decisions and noise can create a high degree of variability in spectral intensity. The cumulative spectrum approach is insensitive to the absolute scale of the spectrum, although it does require an accurate identification and subtraction of the baseline for experimental spectra.
Random forest modeling
Random forest (RF) models for this work were trained using Scikit-learn’s RandomForestRegressor model
54
. The number of trees was fixed at 500, with all features available and max depth unfixed. The dataset was split into train and test components using a 75/25 random train test split function from Scikit-learn. The structure of this model allows for the input of a raw spectrum of arbitrary min and max energy and energy scale. The model then takes the input spectrum and interpolates it to a 0.1 eV resolution from 925 to 970 eV to ensure the consistency of the energy grid used in the training data. Spectral smoothing is then applied using a Savitzy-Golay filter from scipy
55
. The smoothing step is done before the interpolation provided that the inputted spectrum is on an evenly spaced energy scale. The cumulative operation on the spectrum is then performed and this spectrum is the input of the model. The trained RF model is an ensemble of 500 individually trained decision trees, and returns the predictions of each decision tree. A simple average of inferred valence values from each tree is taken as the final prediction, although median and mode predictions can be returned as well. The mode prediction is determined by finding the highest count on a histogram with bin widths of 0.2. The mode is determined by finding the center of the highest bin, meaning integer valence predictions will be returned as 0.1 higher than the integer valence (i.e a prediction of Cu(0) will have a mode of 0.1 assigned to it, as the bin will range from 0.0 to 0.2). The standard deviation of these 500 predictions can approximate the model’s internal confidence in its prediction, and is visualized in the prediction histogram in Figs.

Experimental EELS
To validate the utility of this model on experimental data, experimental EELS spectra of standard reference samples were measured, including Cu metal, Cu
2
O, and CuO. Cu metal was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with 99.999% purity. Cu
2
O and CuO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with 99.99% purity. The Cu
2
O sample was measured using a vacuum holder to prevent oxidation. However, the Cu metal sample was not delivered in a vacuum sealed container, and under the assumption that surface oxidation had already occurred, a vacuum holder was not used for this sample. Using the TEAM I microscope, a double-corrected Thermo Fisher Titan microscope, we acquired monochromated reference data for these samples at roughly 0.2 meV resolution. Data were collected at 300kV with a semi-convergence angle of 17 mrad and a collection angle of 82 mrad. All data was collected using a Gatan Continuum spectrometer equipped with a K3-IS detector operated in electron counting mode. Spectra were baseline subtracted using the GMS Digital Micrograph software package, and spectra were taken using dual EELS to dynamically remove shifts in the reference elastic energy and deconvolved with the simultaneously measured zero-loss region to mitigate artifacts from electrons experiencing multiple scattering events. The deconvolution of multiple scattering is essential to ensure the experimental EELS spectra are comparable to XAS.

Abstract
Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis is one of the most vibrant and promising field in nanoscience. Out of the various mechanisms known to activate chemical reactions in molecules interacting with optically excited nanostructures, the one involving production and transfer of Hot Carriers (HCs) is among the most relevant. Over the past decade, along with stunning advances on HCs control and manipulation, a variety of theoretical and computational strategies have been developed to model this phenomenon and explore its underlying physics. These techniques have provided comprehensive understandings of HCs life stages and dynamics, and allowed valuable insights on their role in photocatalysis. However, to date it is hard to extricate within the plethora of methods developed and the growing number of applications they found. The purpose of this review is to survey the approaches employed so far to model HCs photophysics, rationalizing and classifying the different studies in terms of modelization, theoretical approaches, and approximations.

The study of light-matter interaction at the nanoscale is driving great research efforts at the corner between physics, chemistry, biology, material science and engineering
1
,

,
3
. This because enhancing and manipulating such interaction at the nanometric and sub-nanometric length scales could provide enormous advances on a variety of fields including photonics, catalysis, nanomedicine, and renewable energy
4
,
5
,
6
.
Such progresses can be achieved by controlling the excitation of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), i.e., specific collective oscillatory modes of the electronic cloud, typical of nanoparticles (NPs). By properly tuning structural properties of nanostructures namely their shape and/or composition, it is indeed possible to finely manage the physics of the LSPR and in turn control the wide variety of effects arising from it
7
,

,

.
An important class of technologically relevant phenomena is related to the LSPR decay into Hot Carriers (HCs), out of equilibrium non-thermalized electrons and holes, which have already been exploited in several fields like light harvesting, solar energy and photosensing applications
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
. In addition, since the past decade, much effort was spent to understand and optimize the role of HCs dynamics in the field of photocatalysis
16
,
17
,
18
,
19
,
20
,
21
. This opens new perspectives on the technological applications of plasmonic NPs, since they may be used for instance, to effectively exploit solar power as a renewable energy source
22
,
23
or to produce sustainable fuels starting from simple molecules like water or carbon-dioxide
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
,
28
,
29
,
30
. Indeed, the high yield and selectivity commonly found in HCs-mediated reactions
31
,
32
, stimulated the scientific community to understand the mechanism of these processes in details. To date, plasmon enhancement of reaction rates is considered a multifactorial phenomenon possibly triggered by several fundamental processes, such as charge transfer to specific adsorbates’ antibonding orbitals, reaction barriers lowering in excited state pathways, resonance of near fields with intramolecular transitions, and local increase of temperature, eventually with some of these processes occurring simultaneously

,

,

,

,
37
,

,
39
. The possible coexistence of all of these effects dramatically increases the complexity of the phenomenon translating into intrinsic difficulties in distinguishing the involved mechanisms. As a consequence, the effects of HCs dynamics can typically be only inferred and not directly observed by experimental techniques
40
,
41
,
42
, motivating in turn the large effort spent to investigate the problem using theoretical and computational approaches. Indeed, in the recent years a growing number of theoretical approaches has been applied and/or developed to study plasmonic-generated HCs, causing the proliferation of a rich and original literature. As schematized in Fig.
1
, the amount of publications dealing with HCs modeling and simulations dramatically increased over the past decade and is certainly going to grow substantially in the next future

The variety of this literature is remarkable: some of the studies simulate directly HCs generation from LSPR dephasing to the chemical reaction ignition, others provide information on HCs dynamics and decays; in some works the system is treated on fully atomistic grounds, in others the plasmonic NPs are treated as a jellium; the electron-electron (e-e) interactions are taken into account at many different levels of accuracy ranging from independent particles level to highly correlated quantum chemistry methods; in some cases electron-phonon (e-ph) and electron-holes (e-h) interactions are explicitly considered while in others they are neglected and, finally, the LSPR is either described as an additive effective field acting on the system, or as stemming directly from the electronic system, being one of its possible neutral excitation.
The large amount of methods used to approach this topic is an evidence of the interest it raised over the years, of the challenges it poses and of the different communities that are involved
46
. Rationalizing this huge amount of original theoretical works is the purpose of this review, which is organized as follows. First, we will provide a brief description of the physics behind the HCs phenomena, focusing on their generation, evolution and decays within a metallic NP. We will also describe the various ways in which these carriers can be exploited to catalyze chemical reactions at the NP surface. After that follows the core of this work, where the various strategies developed to investigate HCs phenomena are reviewed and rationalized. A first major distinction here is made between studies employing jellium models and those that adopt an atomistic descriptions of the NP. Within those two frameworks, broad sets of techniques have been developed in order to describe the evolution of the electronic system, going from rate-equation based models
41
,
47
,
48
,
49
, to ab-initio approaches based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT)
50
,
51
. A specific section is then devoted to the strategies that allow to increase the size of the simulated systems, focusing in particular on multiscale techniques, where different parts of the system are treated with different level of theoretical sophistication. Finally, perspectives on how the field might develop in the future are provided, taking into account the constraints and limitations that currently affect the available methodologies, and suggesting possible developements while also considering the most recent advances in the field of plasmonics. As
Supplementary Information,
we provide a brief overview of the main theoretical approaches mentioned in the review, in order to ease readers unfamiliar with these methods to quickly grasp their main features and basic principles. Classical electromagnetic techniques (which are able to describe LSPR features of large metallic NPs, local electric field enhancements and even some features of e-h spatio-temporal dynamics
52
), are already extensively reviewed
53
and thus intentionally left out from the present work when they are not part of a multiscale description of the system.
A challenging problem
A general outline of plasmon generated HCs lifecycle is schematically shown in Fig.
2
, panels a–d. Following the optical excitation (Fig.
2
a), and disregarding radiative recombination, (which can reasonably be neglected considering small sized NP
54
,
55
,
56
), within the firsts tens of femtoseconds the collective motion of the electronic cloud starts to dephase and decays in e-h pairs (Fig.
2
b)
10
,
57
. Before going on into the description of the fate of these photoinduced electronic excitations, it is worth noting that a unified picture of this preliminary decay is not yet available, as its theoretical description depends on the scheme chosen to model the process and on the assumed corresponding approximations
58
. In particular, there are two major approaches that intimately depend on the description of the LSPR:

(I) the LSPR is considered in its polaritonic nature as a mixed light-electronic mode, either quantizing the corresponding field
59
,
60
,
61
or considering it at the semiclassical level
62
, and its decay into e-h pairs is ascribed to the so called Landau damping which, in the quantized case, takes the form of polariton-electron interactions
60
. In this class of approaches the electronic system of the metallic NP is first treated macroscopically, providing a local, space, and frequency-dependent dielectric function
ϵ
(
r
,
ω
) which is used to compute the polaritonic local fields by solving the Maxwell’s equation with the appropriate boundary conditions given by NP shape and size. Eventually, such fields can be treated as quantum objects, following a quantization procedure
60
,
63
. Secondly, the electronic system is considered as a quantum system and its interactions with the (classical or quantized) polaritonic field is typically treated at the lowest order of perturbation theory, most of the times using the Fermi’s golden rule. In this framework, the effects on e-h pairs generation from the scattering with phonons, defects, and NP surface might also be included
41
,
58
.
(II) The LSPR emerges as one of the possible optical excitation of the electronic system, and is excited by an external electromagnetic field, usually treated classically in the dipole approximation. The decay in e-h pairs is the result of e-e interactions and can be witnessed for example through the analysis of the contributions of single particle transitions at different times
64
or by projecting the system’s total density matrix on the basis of the atomic orbitals, to analyze the s, p and d character of the bands HCs populate
65
. In this second class of approaches, the electronic system is treated consistently at a microscopic level throughout the calculations.
The choice of one approach over the other sensibly influences the possible information and interpretation that can be obtained by the computational study, especially the ones focusing on the HCs generation, as we will discuss later. However, in both of these pictures, these preliminary energy and momentum transfers within the electronic system, result in an out-of-equilibrium distribution of the carriers (Fig.
2
b) which rapidly relaxes to an equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution with an apparent temperature higher than the one of the lattice (see Fig.
2
c) through e-e scattering. Without any intervention, carriers thermalize to ambient temperature by e-ph scattering (see Fig.
2
d), recovering the original Fermi-Dirac distribution of the NP
66
,
67
,
68
,
69
. However, in the presence of appropriate species at the NP interfaces, the energetic carriers could be collected, for instance, into a semiconductor upon overcoming the Schottky barrier
70
, or interact with molecular adsorbates triggering chemical reactions.
Several fundamental mechanisms underlie HCs-molecule interactions and their combination/competition drives the molecular evolution toward a specific reaction product
20
,
71
,
72
,
73
. As schematized in Fig.
2
e, the main processes that are possibly involved are:
1.
Direct Charge Transfer: the electromagnetic radiation directly excites electrons (or holes) into the target molecule’s orbitals leaving a corresponding hole (or electron) in the NP. The presence of this additional charge on the molecule eventually weakens (or strengthens) the interatomic interactions favoring the cleavage (or formation) of certain covalent bonds, in the simplest cases because antibonding (or bonding) orbitals are populated. This process requires the molecular orbitals to be strongly hybridized with the NPs bands and molecular unoccupied levels properly aligned with the HCs distribution;
2.
Intramolecular excitation: the optical excitation promotes an intramolecular electronic transition from a molecular binding state to an antibonding orbital. Here, the role of the NP is to provide the near-field enhancement of the radiation impinging the target molecule. The constraint in this case is that the energy of the external field must be resonant with a bright transition leading to the intramolecular excitation;
3.
Indirect Charge Transfer: the optical excitation generates an excited e-h pair population within the NP. Subsequently, part of this population moves towards the target molecule. Here what matters is the alignment between the molecular electronic energy levels and the energy of the excited carriers;
4.
Transient HCs Spillover: the carriers transiently spill out from the NP and interact with the absorbed species, transferring part of their energy into specific molecular vibrations, which in turn ease the cleavage of chemical bonds. This mechanism, which may be triggered by HCs lying below the molecules antibonding energy level, is not expected to provide much energy to the molecular species, but it could persist as long as the HCs energy is completely dissipated;
5.
Increase of Local Temperature: when HCs dissipate their energies by e-ph scattering, the temperature of the system sensibly increases and this induces excitations of molecular vibrational modes which may favor the chemical reaction.
Simulations of HCs generation and evolution allow a fine control over all the factors brought into play and therefore represent a privileged point of view, potentially able to unambiguously unravel the physics behind HCs-related phenomena. Of course such large advantages are balanced by great challenges which are not only ascribed to the modeling of non-equilibrium excited state dynamics of an interacting electronic system (and its eventual coupling to the nuclear degrees of freedom) but also to the presence of different components and different space and time scales. For instance, in the modeling of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis, the electronic coupling at the NP-adsorbate interface requires an atomistic description of the region, whereas common plasmonic NP size ranges between 10 nm to 100 nm; the LSPR decays within 10 fs, but HCs generation may take 10-100 fs, while the their relaxation occurs in about 100-1000 fs

In the next sections we will try to summarize and rationalize the efforts that the scientific community has spent to face these challenges in the recent years. In order to ease the discussion on the various methods, in Table
1
we provide a scheme to summarize and quickly compare what will be extensively explored in the following sections.

Jellium models
Within the category ‘jellium models’, we group all the techniques where the electronic wavefunctions explicitly include only valence electrons, and where core electrons and nuclei are accounted implicitly as an homogeneous background. This kind of modeling has been successfully applied to study HCs generation, relaxation, and transfer as the relatively light amount of computational resources required allows the simulations of large-sized systems (up to tens of nm), properly taking into account the effects coming from NPs geometries, compositions and arrangements. The relative cost-effective use of computational resources makes this technique very flexible and suitable for the investigation of collective plasmonic modes, extrapolation of general trends, and identification of novel effects. However, as they lack of chemical details, these methods do not allow insights related to specific energy level alignments or orbital population. Moreover they can not be used to study dynamical processes involving nuclear dynamics, as in the case of plasmonic-driven chemical reactions. Nevertheless, despite the lack of atomistic resolution, jellium methods provided important insights on the physics underlying HCs dynamics, with the carriers being treated with different levels of theoretical sophistication. In some cases valence electrons are described as independent particles, in others they are subjected to a mean field produced by the other carriers. More refined correlation effects are also included at the DFT or MBPT level. As already mentioned, the plasmonic excitation are either treated as classical (or quantized) field or as one of the possible neutral excitations of the electronic system.
A first basic understanding of HCs generation by LSPR decay using a jellium approach dates back to 2014
62
. Using a semiclassical model the authors considered spherical Ag NPs as free electrons in spherical quantum well, and accounted for the LSPR as a classical field added to the external potential. HCs generation has been evaluated using Fermi golden rule taking into account the optical matrix elements. Although not treating the plasmonic and the single particle excitations at the same level (and thus not taking into account the interplay between the two processes), the work showed how the plasmonic field enhancement is responsible for HCs generation, demonstrating that the rate of this process follows the NP absorption cross-section profile, with a peak at the NP LSPR frequency. As shown in Fig.
3
a they also investigated the role that particle size and carrier lifetime have in HCs production and the results qualitatively follow the available experimental data. A similar approach has been employed to investigate HCs production in non-conventional plasmonic materials
76
and on composite nanosystems
77
, suggesting that core@shell NPs composed by an alkaline metal core and a transition metal shell, could present remarkable HCs production rates. Other studies based on similar physical ingredients, i.e., non-interacting electrons confined within potential wells in the presence of an external electromagnetic field plus an additional classical field representing the LSPR (calculated on the basis of Maxwell’s equations) treated as a perturbation, showed how the energy distribution of excited carriers strongly correlates to the NP size and, depending on the symmetry of the nanocrystal, also on the polarization of the incident radiation
78
,
79
. In these studies the enhancement of HCs generation is connected to the non-homogeneity of the plasmonic field, which can be also interpreted as a consequence of the translational symmetry breaking and consequent non-conservation of momentum due to electron-surface scattering
80
. The amplification of carriers generation in a dimer geometry has been also studied, highlighting the important role of hot spots in these kind of nanostructures
81
and to estimate the rate of HCs available for photon upconversion in a metal-semiconductor device, obtaining a 25% yields for small silver nanocubes
82
. Such a theoretical tool has been further refined in 2017 when Besteiro and coworkers computed the rate of hot electrons production depending on the NP size, geometry, and compositions
83
. By including energy-dependent e-e scattering rates, to obtain the steady state distribution of excited electrons, the authors computed the rate of hot electrons production in gold and silver nanosystems with different sizes, arrangements, and morphology. An example of these results is pictured in Fig.
3
b where hot electrons production rate in two different Au structures are shown. Such predictions were able to capture the mechanisms underlying LSPR dephasing, namely the Drude-like friction process and further interband carriers excitation, plus the generation of HCs due to surfaces or chemical hot spots. This technique revealed itself as particularly flexible since it could to make predictions on complex NPs shapes (such as nanostars and nanorods), confirming the main role of hot spots in HCs generation
84
,
85
. Finally a jellium model including a quantized description of the plasmonic field coupled to a non-interacting electrons system has been used to look at the effects that an optically active environment might have into the LSPR decay into e-h pairs
61

Aiming to investigate HCs relaxation dynamics, a master equation for the time-dependent single-particle population, including the effects of e-e and e-ph scattering, was propagated in time
86
,
87
. In these works the NPs are treated as jellium nanospheres, e-e scattering rates are explicitly computed using a screened Coulomb interaction approach while e-ph scattering rates are empirically parametrized. These studies emphasize the role of e-e scattering and show that, while the time scale of single e-e scattering events is very short (~10 fs), the HCs distribution lifetime is significantly larger (~100–1000 fs) as shown in Fig.
3
c. This because hundreds of scattering events per single electron are required for a complete thermalization of the electronic cloud. Similar results have been recently obtained using a model which also account for the HCs generation and further extraction by an attached molecule
88
.
Jellium approaches where the electron correlation is treated at the DFT level have been employed to study electron transport through an atomic junction in a plasmonic dimers
89
. Here the authors found a strengthening of the electronic current with the decrease of the NP-NP gap size, and this has been ascribed to the plasmonic local field enhancement which was found being strongly anisotropic and frequency dependent. Similarly in ref.
90
a plasmonic dimer has been modelled as a two levels system, showing that the presence of low energy plasmons can lead to remarkable charge transfers rates if the resonance between the two levels system matches the Fermi energy level of the NPs. Analogous effects on the tunneling currents between NPs and a two levels quantum dot have been also found
91
.
Modeling the plasmonic NP as a jellium allowed also to explore the impact a dielectric environment has on HCs generation and thermalization. Using DFT to calculate the effective e-e interaction, it was possible to show how different dielectric environments modifies the NPs density of states and thus influences the HCs production rate. In particular higher generation rates are found when the host materials has large dielectric constants, since it produces larger electron-plasmon couplings
92
.
MBPT approaches have been seldomly applied to this kind of systems within the jellium framework. In ref.
93
the authors adopted an equation of motion for the density matrix to study the time-dependent dynamics of photoexcited electrons within a 0.5 nm sphere, treated as a jellium system, including also the Coulomb interaction at the mean-field HF level, yielding resonances shifts and state mixing at the linear response level. The lifetime of single particle excitations for jellium spheres with sizes up to 10 nm have been studied using the GW approximation for the electronic self-energy
94
. The calculated lifetimes are in the femtosecond range and resulted almost independent by the NP size. Their energy dependence however strongly deviates from the bulk one and this is explained in terms of localization of the excited electrons close to the surface, where screening is reduced
95
. More recently, the adoption of MBPT within the GW approximation lead to the estimation of coupling strength of quasiparticles to neutral excitations in a series of sodium NPs
96
. This approach shows how in those systems HCs distributions present discrete peaks, with hot electrons collecting a considerable fraction of the LSPR energy. Moreover, compared to semiclassical models, this approach allowed the estimation of more accurate production rates, especially in smaller NPs.
Ab-initio atomistic approaches, frozen nuclei
While providing important insights on the general mechanism of HCs generation and dynamics, jellium models can not explicitly account for the material dependency of the processes
97
. Indeed the inclusion of the nanosystem’s nuclear texture and its consequent well defined band structure, strongly influences optical excitation, carriers’ generation rate, transport properties, and fields enhancements
98
. This in turn has remarkable impact in determining absorption spectra, carriers’ lifetimes
99
, energy and momentum distributions
100
, vibronic couplings
101
, and the dynamics of carriers population
65
. Moreover, the atomistic structure plays a dominant role in how metal-adsorbate interfaces affect the plasmon damping and therefore deeply affects the photocatalytic properties of the systems
102
. For these reasons, in the past years the computational nanoscience community devoted huge efforts in modeling HCs phenomena using fully atomistic first principles approaches
103
.
Such methods indeed explicitly account for the existence of the atomic nuclei, providing a detailed description of the system’s electronic band structure. This comes at the cost of a higher consumption of computational resources. Therefore such techniques are typically employed when investigating the opto-electronic properties of small sized structures (composed by hundreds of atoms), and when modeling specific electronic process (such as carriers transfer). However, strong efforts are made in the community to increase the size of the systems that can be studied (see section “Increasing the size of the system”). As summarized in line 2 of Table
1
a first class of studies characterizes the first phases of the LSPR decay through the determination of transport properties such as HCs lifetimes and mean free paths built upon calculations of bulks or slabs-related quantities
48
,
104
,
105
. The DFT bulk density of state, for instance, has been used in ref.
104
to build an effective one-band model from which Seibel and coworkers derive the collision integrals for the electron–elctron and absorption terms of the Boltzmann equation for time-dependent electron distribution of noble-metal nanoparticles.
The computational strategy used in these works relies on considering a quantized LSPR field of an infinitely extended interface between a metal, with its own frequency-dependent dielectric function, and a dielectric material, whose electromagnetic response are modelled through a frequency-independent dielectric constant; in the meantime, the coupling of the LSPR with bulk carriers is computed using the lowest order interaction vertex
60
,
100
. In this framework, the plasmon decay and consequent carriers distributions and lifetimes have been studied for a range of materials using a first principle approach based on DFT coupled with Wannier interpolation methods to calculate the band structure and the entity of e-ph interaction, while the description of e-e contribution to the carriers lifetime relied on the GW approximation
106
. Distinct microscopic decay mechanisms can be evaluated in this way, from direct interband excitations to indirect phonon-assisted and intraband geometry assisted ones
107
,
108
. As represented in Fig.
4
a, these studies show how in the HCs generation phase, the direct excitation mechanism dominates above the interband threshold, while the geometry assisted one, relevant at lower energies, becomes more and more relevant as the size of the system shrinks. The importance of the direct process for Au and Ag is reported also in ref.
60
, where similar energy-dependent carriers lifetimes (1 to ~30 fs) and comparable (~10 fs) e-e and e-ph scattering rates and relaxation times were reported
60

In search for the optimal plasmonic material, the optical properties and carriers lifetimes of bulk transition metal nitrides have been studied using a similar methodology
109
. In this case, the more complex bands structure leads to exotic carrier distributions, covering the entire range from the Fermi level to the photon energy, and interband direct processes dominate HCs generation while the indirect phonon assisted ones are important at lower energies. By combining the aforementioned approach with non-linear Boltzmann equations it was possible to study the excited carriers population dynamics for the interpretation of pump probe experiments in gold NPs
48
. With this setup the authors proved that the optical stimulation generates a non-equilibrium electron distribution, which in the first 100 fs decays and populates levels close to the Fermi energy, thermalizing in ~700 fs. Further thermalization with the lattice happens over several ps.
Concerning ultrafast femtosecond spectroscopies on plasmonic nanostructures, it is worth mentioning in this section the so called Three Temperatures Model (3TM), a semiclassical rate equation approach which typically gets from experiments, but in principle also from ab-initio calculations, part of its microscopic ingredients such as the e-e scattering rates and e-ph coupling coefficients
47
. The rate equations of the 3TM describe the temporal evolution of three energetic variables: the excess energy density of non-thermalized electrons, an electronic term directly related to the optical excitation, and the electronic and lattice temperatures. The dynamics of these three variables are coupled by coefficients that include e-e and e-ph scattering rates and are modulated by temperature dependent electron and lattice heat capacities. This approach has been applied to study the HCs generation yield in metal-oxide nanocomposites decorated by plasmonic Au NP
110
, the ultrafast non-radiative relaxation of optically excited free carriers in CuFeS

Also in these cases the plasmonic NP was modeled as an extended surface; the optical excitation, on the other hand, has been indirectly introduced, mimiking its effect through the presence of an additional electron or an excited e-h pair in the system. When describing the entire NP on atomistic footing, as shown in the third row of Table
1
, most of the studies rely on TDDFT, which, within the available approximations of the exchange-correlation kernel, allows the simulations of moderately large and complex structures
115
. Within TDDFT, the LSPR consistently develops as the response of the whole electronic structure to the external field coupled to it through the dipole approximation.
TDDFT equations can be solved either in frequency or time domains. In the frequency domain, a configurational representation in the space of single-particle transitions is used, leading the so called Casida’s equations
116
. This approach provides important information on excited states (such as its decomposition in terms of single particle transitions) but is computationally demanding, especially if looking at the high energy part of the spectrum
117
,
118
.
First TDDFT studies of the plasmonic response of metallic nanostructures focused on systems composed of a few tens of atoms. For instance, in 2008 a TDDFT-based determination of the absorption spectra of small Ag nanoclusters (ranging from 20 to 120 atoms) showed how the energy of the main absorption peak, associated to the LSPR, decreases as the size of the nanosystem increases, while the peak width stays approximately constant
119
, thus suggesting a common time scale for the dephasing of bright transitions (like the LSPR). Later, the optical responses of Au nanoclusters with sizes up to 172 atoms were analyzed, focusing on the dependence of the LSPR peak position
120
. The results confirmed the picture found on Ag based systems, highlighting at the same time the main role that the system’s geometry has in determining the spectral shape. Further insights on Au structures with smaller sizes revealed that the main absorption peaks in the optical spectrum are composed by mixed intraband and interband transitions
121
,
122
. Frequency-domain TDDFT calculations were succesfully applied also in the case of multi-particles systems
123
nanoalloys
124
,
125
, and demonstrate the existence of long-living triplet excited states in small metallic nanosystems
126
. While novel algorithms based on the complex dynamical polarizability allowed the application of frequency-domain TDDFT also to larger size systems up to ~400 atoms

the standard frequency-domain approach method has been effectively employed also in the study of the optical transitions involved in photocatalysed reactions, such as the reduction of organic molecules over metallic surfaces
134
and the CO
2
methanation over Ag
25
nanocluster, as show in Fig.

.
Linear response properties can be addressed within TDDFT also employing real-time propagation (rt-TDDFT). In this case the optical response of the system is obtained by Fourier transforming the real-time evolution of the electronic dipole excited by a delta-like external pulse which equally excites all possible electronic modes. While no energy limitations due to computational burdening is present within rt-TTDFT, part of the information on excited states, such as the single particle transition contributions, is typically lost (although techniques are being developed in order to recover it
136
). Moreover the quality of the simulation and in particular the absorption peaks resolution strongly depends on the choice of calculation parameters such as the trajectory length or the size of the box containing the system (in the real-space framework)
137
. This kind of time propagation is anyway really powerful and largely employed in the study of the optical properties of a variety of systems, including plasmonic structures like nanotube assembly
138
and Na ring dimers
139
. These works showed the effect different incident field polarizations have on various aggregates configurations, addressing the origin of the low energy charge-transfer excitation and suggesting a way to tune the optical response based on the relative position of the components. rt-TDDFT allowed also to look at the optical spectra and plasmonic character of excitations in noble and transition metals arrays
140
whereas, in linear metallic chains the dependence of the LSPR with respect to chains lengths and nature has been accurately investigated confirming the presence of non-linear effects connected to the Landau damping of the collective oscillations
141
. As already mentioned, with rt-TDDFT approaches it is possible to investigate systems with larger sizes compared to frequency-domain techniques. For example, it have been possible to explore the LSPR of ichosaedral gold
142
and silver
143
aggregates made of more than 1000, allowing to study the development of the plasmonic modes with increasing cluster sizes and the screening effect caused by the d electrons. The optical spectra of Al and Ag NPs of up to c.a. 560 atoms have been also characterized
144
.
Going beyond the determination and characterization of the optical linear response of the system, if the external field is set resonant with the LSPR, rt-TDDFT simulations can be applied to study directly the dynamics of plasmonic HCs witnessing the microscopic mechanisms of generation and injection. For example, in this way, it was possible to study HCs generation in Ag
55
nanoclusters favored by the presence of single band transitions resonant with the LSPR
145
, and HCs injection in a variety of systems: in 2019, a rt-TDDFT study of prototype metal-acceptor interface Ag
147
Cd
33
Se
33
showed the existence of a direct hot electrons transfer between the metallic center and the semiconductor
146
, whereas in the case of the Ag
20
interface with TiO
2
, charge separation happened in two steps consisting in a first fast (~10 fs) electron injection from the cluster to the semiconductor due to the LSPR decay, followed by a second charge sloshing between the two components due to a low frequency charge transfer plasmonic mode
147
. The simulation of CO absorbed on Ag
147
instead showed how hot electrons stemming from LSPR decay could be actually transferred to the molecular adsorbate and how the transfer probability dependeds on the adsorption site
148
. The important role played by the NP-molecule coupling for HCs generation and injection was also shown in the cases of sodium cluster-hexacene
149
and Ag, Cu, and Au clusters-CO systems
150
. Analysis on the role of the local atomic environment on the HCs generation unveiled how in Ag
561
the energy of an external pulse is distributed among resonant and non-resonant transitions, with the former responsible for the HCs generation, receiving the largest part of the pulse energy, as shown in Fig.
4
c. Moreover with this method it was possible to demonstrate how low-coordinated sites produce larger amounts of hot electrons while hot holes are produced more homogeneously within the NPs, this difference being addressed to the different sp and d character of the bands
64
. In the meantime, a plasmon-mediated non-linear response has been found in the electronic dynamics of an Ag
8
cluster
151
. Linear chains of metallic atoms have been studied to investigate the dynamics and catalytic properties of HCs, demonstrating that molecular bond cleavage can be catalyzed by non-linear effects in tunneling currents
152
, plasmonic enhancement of local electric field
153
and by the activation of inner vibrational modes by hot electrons injections
154
. Interestingly, all these studies highlight the paramount importance of the chemical property of molecule over other features such as the NP nature or shape.
Coupling electronic and nuclear motion
Nuclear degrees of freedom and their coupling with the electronic system may influence carriers generation and transfer
60
,
155
. Indeed, in order to be efficient, charge separation should be faster than energy relaxation through vibrational degrees of freedom and, at the same time, the role of vibrations, associated to local heating, might promote the photocatalytic performance of plasmonic devices
39
. The role of HCs as main actors of photocatalysis is indeed questioned in a number of works that identify pure local thermal enhancement as the source of the high photocatalytic performances of plasmonic systems
36
,
156
,
157
,
158
,
159
. The inclusion of nuclear dynamics in electronic calculations is therefore fundamental to elucidate the competing, or possibly synergic, roles of the various phenomena and is necessary to precisely determine the mechanism of the reactions catalyzed by HCs. Such a huge predictive power however is accompanied by highly cost-intensive simulations. In fact, in addition to the electronic structure and dynamics, these calculations have to consider the ions dynamics and relative phonon structure, and the mutual interactions between nuclei and the excited carriers. Although these aspects can be accounted through various levels of approximation (as we are going to describe in this section), the complexity of the simulations is intrinsically higher compared to frozen-nuclei approaches, making the calculations more computational demanding. These methods are therefore suitable to explore local and specific photochemical processes (such as bond breaking or formation), are not currently usable to model long-lasting phenomena on large-sized systems. Moreover, most of the studies that couple electronic and ionic degrees of freedom employ TDDFT to model the electronic part, using approximated kernels which are not fully adequate for the description of charge transfer phenomena. In this framework, rt-TDDFT coupled to Ehrenfest dynamics
160
has been successfully applied to study the interplay between LSPR decay and vibrational modes in a silver particle composed of 55 atoms
145
. Here e-h pairs generation depends strongly on the availability of single-particle excitations resonant with the plasmon frequency (if available the decay time scale would be in the ~10 fs range, whereas if unavailable a much slower dynamics and Rabi oscillations emerged). In the studied time scale (~100 fs) the effect of e-ph interactions were negligible. Instead, ~ 40 fs seemed enough to activate the cleavage of a O-H bond in H
2
O molecule upon photoexcitation of a Au
20
tetrahedral structure embedded in liquid water, as visible in Fig.
4
d
161
. This study showed also the concomitant importance of plasmonic field enhancement and charge transfer from the nanocluster to the antibonding orbitals of the water molecule.
N
2
splitting at the edge of linear silver chains has been studied using the same approach
153
,
162
. Also in this case, upon photoexcitation of the metallic system, the cleavage of the molecular adsorbate, which can be linked to the direct excitation of charge transfer states involving Ag states and N
2
antibonding orbitals, occurs in tens of fs, well within HCs lifetime (see Fig.
2
). This work also elucidated the role played by the external (static or dynamic) electric field in metal-catalyzed H
2
photodissociation
163
.
A plasmon enhanced intramolecular charge transfer instead, is responsible for the photodecomposition of NH
3
on Ag clusters simulated within rt-TDDFT and Ehrenfest dynamics
21
. Similar calculations demonstrated that a rapid plasmon-induced water splitting can be obtained by substitution of an Ag atom by a Pb atom in a Ag cluster
164
. Interestingly, without Pb substitution the water molecule would not split. The Pb atom in this case provided both an increase in optical absorption and in the molecule-cluster coupling.
Plasmonic-driven CO
2
photoreduction has been further investigated by means of rt-TDDFT and Ehrenfest dynamics on silver nanostructures finding evidences of a cooperative interplay between indirect and direct HCs transfer, leading to effective photoreduction (see Fig.
4
e). Interestingly, these results show that the contributions of the two physical processes can be tuned changing the intensity of the external electromagnetic field
30
. Starting from the population of a plasmonic-like single particle orbital, a combination of rt-TDDFT and NAMD implementing the FSSH technique provided insights on the electron injection dynamics from a photoexcited Au cluster into a TiO
2
surface
165
. The delocalization of the excited state lead to an immediate charge transfer with 50% probability. In the remainig 50% of times the e-h pair is generated within the NP and the electrons are subsequently transferred to the TiO
2
slab within 100 fs while releasing energy to the lattice phonons. A follow up study on similar NP-semiconductor systems reveal that charge transfer can occur according to both the direct and indirect mechanisms described in the section “A challenging problem”, which can coexist and cooperate providing a faster and more effective charge separation
166
. A sub-picosecond hot hole transfer from a gold nanocluster to a GaN slab has been found using similar NAMD techniques
167
. The net hot holes transfer from the metal to the semiconductor, occurring in a subpicosecond scale, is followed by a back-flow of carriers toward the metal species. The authors suggest that such back-flow could be controlled by applying an external potential that modified the Schottky barrier, or by interposing another species such as ZnO between the metal and the semiconductor. A slower, indirect charge transfer mechanism concerns the photoinduced electron injection from Au nanorods to MoS
2
, as shown in ref.
168
. In this case a fast (30 fs) LSPR decay in HCs pairs within the Au nanorod is followed by a subsequent transfer to the MoS
2
within 100 fs. The relaxation due to e-ph interaction would not show its effect before 200 fs. To rationalize the results of the Au cluster-TiO
2
interface (direct charge transfer) and those of the Au nanorods-MoS
2
ones (indirect charge transfer) it was argued that the specific character of the charge transfer could be ascribed to the degree of coupling between the NP and the semiconductor
168
. The FSSH technique has also been used to study the effect of Sn substitution on hot electrons lifetime in Pt nanoclusters-semiconductor devices
169
, and was useful to introduce a new mechanism for energy transfer from a Au plasmonic layer to a semiconductive substrate in which the overlap between the electronic wavefunctions of the two materials allow the transfer of energy without effective charge transfer
170
. rt-TDDFT coupled with FSSH NAMD has also been used to investigate CO
2
photoreduction on rutile TiO
2
(110) showing an important interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom: the excitation of specific vibrational modes stabilizes the CO
2
LUMO which can then trap photoexcited electrons coming from the substrate so that CO
2
gets reduced
171
. This step, which typically takes place spontaneously on transition metal surfaces
172
, is prodromal to further reduction steps leading to the synthesis of small hydrocarbons and thus to a sustainable and effective CO
2
recycling process

.
Increasing the size of the system
As mentioned in the section “A challenging problem”, the main challenges in the simulation of HCs mediated processes in hybrid NP-molecular systems arise from the combination of different length and time scales, and from the variety of phenomena that are involved. While the molecular system, the interface region, the charge transfer, and excitation (at least concerning the molecular part) require atomistic quantum-mechanical treatment in the Å length scale, the typical dimensions of plasmonic NPs are within the 10-100 nm range and can reach even the
μ
m
175
,
176
. To enlarge the size of the simulated systems while maintaining the computational feasibility, two possible routes are available: using a lower level of approximations of the whole system or using multiscale approaches
177
. Following the first route, approximations to the kinetic term of the standard TDDFT approaches lead to an orbital-free formulation of TDDFT which has been applied to Na NPs with diameter up to 12.3 nm
178
, Na NPs dimers and trimers
179
, and to Na nanorods
180
. All these studies showed non-trivial behaviors upon bridging the quantum and classical regimes: for instance the sodium NPs absorption spectra would alternately blue shift, red shift and blue shift again upon size decrease as shown in Fig.
5
a
178
. Another way to make TDDFT calculations more affordable is to exploit the tight-binding approach in which the Kohn-Sham functional is expanded up to the second order around a reference density given by the neutral atoms, and charge fluctuations are decomposed and approximated in atom-centered monopolar contributions
181
. This method has been used to study the generation of HCs in noble metal nanoclusters and nanoalloys
65
,
182
,
183
, extending the possible size of the systems beyond 30 nm
183
,
184
. and, when applied to study the properties of metallic structures based on alkaline-metals elements, revealed that, upon excitation, Mg nanoclusters can produce high energetic carriers, suggesting important consequences in chemical processes such as hydrogen evolution
185
. With this level of theory it was possible to study the H
2
photodissociation dynamics over Au and Ag octahedral nanostructures with sizes up to 2.2 nm, elucidating also how the nature of the optical excitations affects the photocatalytic outcome. In particular the authors found that in Au NPs, interband excitations are more effective than LSPR to promote the H
2
cleavage, while the opposite holds for Ag NPs
186
. Interestingly, the authors found the same size-dependance energy trend for the sp and d nature of the optical excitations as in ref.
187
. Charge separation at the NP-semiconductor interface has been also investigate with tight-binding TDDFT
188
. This case is particularly interesting as it partially revises previous results obtained on the very same system (Au NP over a TiO
2
slab) at the TDDFT level
147
and extends the analysis to the photocatalytic consequences of interfacial charge transfer. Here, the authors demonstrate that, upon charge separation, the carriers gets stabilized by purely electronic features preventing charge recombination on short timescales. This gives the transferred carriers enough time to activate specific vibrational modes in adsorbed molecular species, which in turn leads to an easier bond dissociation
188
. Finally, to obtain the spatial resolved energy distribution of HCs that reach the surface of realistic nanostructures (~100 nm), a non-equilibrium scattering in space and energy methodology has been proposed
49
. The method combines probabilistic and stochastic approaches to classical transport in combination with source terms and collision models based on accurate electronic structure and e-ph calculations.

To further increase the size of the system while keeping (or even enhance) the theoretical description of a part of it, multiscale methods, in which different regions are modeled at a different level of theoretical accuracy, can be used
189
. Many of these methodologies offer the opportunity to take into account the presence of an entire NP regardless of its size and shape, revealing how effects and phenomena identified by smaller scale studies might be enhanced or hidden when the whole system is involved. Multi-scale techniques are specifically adapted to study problems requiring high-resolution on a specific part of the system (e.g., where a chemical reaction take place) while explicitly accounting for the effects coming from the environment or from another part of the structure under study. Of course, in order to obtain meaningful results it is mandatory to have a solid rationale that guides the division of the system into the various domains where the different theoretical levels are applied. Moreover, the communication between these regions have to be computationally effective and physically accurate. Extended discussions about these issues are available in the literature, see e.g. ref.
189
. As summarized in Table
1
, row 5, within multiscale methods there are cases where all regions are treated at the quantum level, either using different system modeling (jellium or atomistic) or different approximations for the quantum problem (e.g., DFT or wavefunction based methods), leading to the so-called QM/QM approaches. In other cases, the system is partitioned in a quantum and a classical region using either discrete, QM/MM methods summarized in row 5 of Table
1
, or continuum models QM/continuum methods (Table
1
, row 6). Employing different modeling of the two subsystems, hot electrons transfer from metallic NPs approximated as jellium medium, to molecules treated atomistically, has been studied using rt-TDDFT coupled to Ehrenfest dynamics
24
. This allowed fundamental insights on the H
2
dissociation process at the metallic NP surface. The study highlighted the importance of the hybridization of the molecular and NP orbitals and of the specific energy level alignment; resulting in a net charge transfer between the NP and the H
2
antibonding orbitals. The magnitude of the charge transfer strongly depends on the NP-molecule distance and, interestingly, in a dimer geometry, the photocatalytic effect is suppressed when the H
2
molecule is located exactly in between the two NPs, due to rapid population and subsequent depopulation of the H
2
antibonding orbital. Water splitting reaction on Au NP has been also investigated using a similar computational approach
190
. By looking at the time evolution of O-H bonds, the study showed how the rate of the reaction depends on the specific plasmonic mode that is excited, suggesting a reaction mechanism that involves the destabilization of the O-H bond through the population of water antibonding orbitals as the LSPR decays, in a time window of 10–20 fs. In 2021, Huang et al. provided further insights on the plasmon-driven water splitting by Au
20
nanostructures
191
. In this case, the rt-TDDFT and Ehrenfest dynamics of an Au
20
nanocluster interacting with an H
2
O molecule was carried out under the influence of an external laser field and of the near field of a nanosized tetrahedron obtained by classical finite-difference time-domain numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations. This study showed the dependence of the reaction rate on the NP size, incident light frequency and intensity, and near-field spatial distribution.
Embedding quantum-quantum multiscale methods have been applied to the description of the ground state
192
and photoinduced phenomena in molecules chemisorbed on plasmonic NPs
193
. In particular, within the Embedded Correlated Wavefunction (ECW) method
74
,
193
the sensitive portion of the system (i.e. metallic cluster together with adsorbate molecule) is treated at a high level of theory in the presence of an embedding potential obtained through a DFT ground state calculation, and properly accounting for the environment. ECW has been used to study the influence of the metal-adsorbate interface on plasmon damping
102
and photocatalytic processes such as H
2
dissociation on Al NPs
194
, H desorption from a Pd surface
195
, ammonia decomposition on Cu NPs
196
and Cu-Ru alloyed antenna-reactor systems
197
, methane dry reforming on Cu-Ru antenna-reactor system
198
, and the activation of carbon-fluorine bonds, as visible from Fig.
5
b
199
. The ECW method allows the estimation of excited states activation energies by accurately computing excited states along the geometries of the ground state reaction pathway. Indeed a reduction of the effective barrier upon optical excitation has been found for both H desorption
195
(for which also vibrational excitation seem to play an important role
200
) and ammonia decomposition on Cu NPs
196
. No charge transfers has been detected in these cases whereas it emerged in H
2
decomposition on Al NPs
194
. In the case of NH
3
decomposition on the Cu-Ru system, the rate-determining step for the excited state pathway is different than the one of the ground state reaction
197
. Recently, the very same reactions have been investigated using a similar computational approach also on antenna-reactor systems that use as catalytic centers Fe and Pd nanodisks
201
.
Within current implementations of the ECW approach, the embedding potential is computed once for all at the ground state DFT level. A dynamic coupling and feedback between subsystems is instead included in most QM/MM and QM/Continuum methods where the NP is either treated classically as a continuous body or as a discrete system using a MM force field
202
,
203
,
204
. These methods accurately capture how excitation energies, optical and spectroscopic properties of molecules are affected by the presence of plasmonic NPs even for atomic scale protrusions
205
,
206
,
207
and for complex environments including solvents
204
,
208
,
209
,
210
. However, within the classical region, electrons are not explicitly taken into account. This limitation does not allow the application of these methods to study molecules chemisorbed on the NP surface, charge transfer excitations, and transport phenomena between NPs and molecular species, unless at least a portion of the NP is included in the quantum region. When polarizable QM/MM techniques pair a TDDFT description of the molecule with a classical atomistic representation of the metal NP, it is possible to simulate NPs made of 10
5
–10
6
atoms
211
. This approach has been used to look at the optical properties of rhodamine-6G and crystal violet adsorbed on silver and gold NPs
212
, at the study of surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra for pyridine adsorbed on different sites of icosahedral NPs with diameters between 1 and 8 nm
213
, and at the investigation of the optical response of thymidine absorbed on gold surfaces in an aqueous environment, as show in Fig.

PCM, originally designed to describe solvent effects, has recently been adapted to model plasmonic NPs in the proximity of a system treated at a quantum level, within a QM/continuum approach
202
. PCM combined with time-dependent HF and TDDFT in the frequency domain allowed to the study of excitation energies of formaldehyde and merocyanine
215
and of fluorescence enhancements of molecules on NPs
205
,
216
. A continuum description of the plasmonic NP combined with many-body Green’s function approach provided a microscopic theory of plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies which included self-consistently the Coulomb interaction between the NP and the molecule through an additional self-energy term
217
,
218
,
219
. PCM studies on plasmonic NPs were also extended to time domain simulations
220
, with the possibility of including the effects of decoherence by environment-induced dephasing
221
. By coupling this approach with a MBPT active space for the quantum system, it was possible to explain the how photoexcitation enhanced the selectivity towards methane formation of CO
2
reduction on Rh nanocubes
222
. Still within QM-continuum approaches, a hybrid quasi-static finite-difference time-domain model coupled with TDDFT, suggested the importance of the dynamic coupling between the classical and quantum systems for the description of the spectral changes and enhanced photoabsorption of a Na dimer between two metallic NPs
223
. As depicted in Fig.
5
d, rt-TDDFT coupled to classical near field electrodynamics allowed to study the dynamical charge transfer between H
2
O molecule and Mg(0001) slab where a small portion of the Mg slab and the water molecule were treated quantum-mechanically
224
. Continuous and classical atomistic models have been used also concurrently. For example a multiscale approach combining PCM, MM and TDDFT allowed to study the LH2 light-harvesting pigment of purple bacteria in protein environment and in proximity of tip-shaped gold NPs
225
and gold nanorods
226
; similarly the light harvesting process of the peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex on a silver island film has been studied revealing the best geometries and shapes for the optimization of the fluorescence enhancement.
Perspectives
Developing theoretical tools able to capture and predict the behavior of HCs given a specific combination of metallic NP, molecular species and/or semiconductor, and external electromagnetic radiation, lead to the great amount of theoretical and computational work that this review tries to put together and rationalize. Given the complexity of the problem much has still to be done in order to be able to go beyond qualitative descriptions and become quantitatively predictive. Jellium models have provided and still provide basic understandings on the physics behind HC generation and its dependence on particle size and shape; the specific material dependence of the process, especially important to describe the interaction between NP and molecule are naturally introduced relying on DFT-based methodologies. Such ab-initio approaches provided insights on the mechanisms behind HCs generation, transport and injection, allowing remarkable advancements of the discipline. However, DFT-based techniques rely on approximated kernels to tackle the electron correlation and this, in turn, affects the computational predictions especially when dealing with systems where the relative alignment of electronic levels and charge transfer phenomena have a primary importance
74
. In this view, finding ways to implement more sophisticated theories (such as MBPT
94
) without increasing too much the computational cost and/or coupling them with multiscale
189
or embedding approaches could be extremely fruitful. Particularly promising are also the novel real-time non-equilibrium Green’s function formulations
227
, that include e-ph and e-e scattering at the first principle level. Indeed understanding and describing the coupling between HCs and nuclear degrees of freedom is extremely important, not only to monitor the onset of the chemical reaction but also to address the relationship between improved catalytic performance and system temperature, the interplay between chemical species and NP phonons
228
, and the role of inelastic electron-vibrational scattering
200
. In this case, to simulate realistic conditions, further developments and applications of multiscale approaches coupled to NAMDs simulations are highly desirable
229
,
230
. Theoretical investigation on plasmon-induced photochemistry could also benefit of the novel developments concerning NAMDs simulations themselves like trajectory-based methods, that avoid the calculation of electronic potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings
231
, or spin mapping approaches
232
. Moreover a richer physics could be grasped using recent developments that bridge quantum optics and condensed matter, accounting explicitly for the mutual interaction between electrons, nuclei and photons beyond the
standard
light-matter coupling approaches
233
,
234
,
235
,
236
. These novel strategies would provide an even more comprehensive view to the field and include novel phenomena, such as polaritonic-driven dynamics and chemistry
237
.
To date, countless experimental studies have shown how plasmon-mediated photocatalysis has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry, allowing high-efficiency production of compounds such as NH
3
from atmospheric nitrogen
238
, or H
2
via water splitting
239
. In addition, these type of processes are already being used to convert CO
2
into more versatile chemicals and fuels
26
, and in other reactions that can significantly contribute to mitigate the impact of climate change in the coming years
240
,
241
. In this view, great insights on the origin of the photocatalytic activity of plasmonic NPs have been provided by embedding multiscale methods. Here, further progress could be achieved going beyond a static embedding and/or using MBPT, instead of high level theoretical chemistry methods for the sensitive portion of the system, allowing to enlarge it without losing accuracy
242
. However, not only length scales, but also time scales strongly vary in this class of phenomena. Therefore coupled multiscale methodologies encompassing different time scales should be developed to monitor the evolution of the system from the light pulse to the chemical reactions. As we tried to highlight in this review, to date there is still no a
universal
modeling approach, i.e., a technique able to consider all the complexity and multitude physical effects emerging when light interacts with hybrid NP-molecule systems. However, this does not imply that there are no valuable tools to study these systems in detail. Each of the existing modeling approaches have their own peculiarities which make them suitable to investigate certain specific phenomena. Jellium models, for example, are best suited to understand how the opto-electronic properties of a system depend on the morphology (size, geometry, chemical ordering etc.) of the NP, but they are insufficient to predict reaction mechanisms. On the other hand, ab-initio approaches can elucidate the role of the local atomistic structure in the various HCs life stages and in the formation/destruction of chemical bonds, but they cannot explicitly account for long-range effects coming from the NP extended structure or from the environment. Given their multi-domain nature, multiscale models seem to be a viable solution to combine the advantages of the mentioned methods, and yet they are not exempt from complications. Indeed, approximating the physics of different regions with different levels of theoretical sophistication is extremely delicate as the criterion adopt to set the boundaries has a huge impact on the quality of the model. Further advances of theoretical and computational techniques towards the description of plasmonic-related phenomena will also necessarily deal with the new trends and evidences coming from the experimental progresses. Indeed, in recent years, important advances have been made in the design of efficient composite nanomaterials
163
,
243
,
244
, exotic-shaped nanostructures
245
,
246
, and non-trivial NPs arrangements
247
such as so-called antenna-reactor systems
198
,
201
,
248
. Huge advances have been recently reached in monitoring carrier dynamics
75
,
249
, exploiting the gaps between NPs to activate polaritonic effects
250
,
251
,
252
,
253
, increasing the efficiency of NP-to-semiconductor charge transfer
254
and using HCs production and transfer as core mechanism for photodetectors
255
. It is worth mentioning also the massive development of the field of chiral plasmonics, which allow to use of external light pulse polarization as a driving force to control HCs production and dynamics and thus to perform photocatalysis
33
,
256
,
257
,
258
,
259
,
260
,
261
. All these experimental advancements poses new and exciting challenges that we believe are going to stimulate novel developments in modeling and predicting plasmonic-based phenomena, and will eventually be supported by the application of frontiers technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence

Ferroelectrics and multiferroics
Abstract
Since the first report of ferroelectricity in nanoscale HfO
2
-based thin films in 2011, this silicon-compatible binary oxide has quickly garnered intense interest in academia and industry, and continues to do so. Despite its deceivingly simple chemical composition, the ferroelectric physics supported by HfO
2
is remarkably complex, arguably rivaling that of perovskite ferroelectrics. Computational investigations, especially those utilizing first-principles density functional theory (DFT), have significantly advanced our understanding of the nature of ferroelectricity in these thin films. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the computational efforts to understand ferroelectric hafnia, comparing various metastable polar phases and examining the critical factors necessary for their stabilization. The intricate nature of HfO
2
is intimately related to the complex interplay among diverse structural polymorphs, dopants and their charge-compensating oxygen vacancies, and unconventional switching mechanisms of domains and domain walls, which can sometimes yield conflicting theoretical predictions and theoretical-experimental discrepancies. We also discuss opportunities enabled by machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics and phase-field simulations to go beyond DFT modeling, probing the dynamical properties of ferroelectric HfO
2
and tackling pressing issues such as high coercive fields.

2
) thin films
1
quickly positioned HfO
2
as a prime material for incorporating ferroelectric functionalities into integrated circuits. Its robust switchable electrical polarization at the nanoscale
2
,
3
, simple chemical composition, and excellent compatibility with the modern complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology have led to its implementation in various memory devices
4
,
5
, sparking renewed interest in developing nonvolatile, energy-efficient, and high-speed ferroelectric memory. Moreover, this discovery has fundamentally enhanced our understanding of ferroelectric physics, which was traditionally focused on perovskite oxides. There are several notable conceptual breakthroughs stemming from the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia. First, the prototypical perovskite ferroelectric, BaTiO
3
, contains the 3
d
element titanium, where the Ti 3
d
–O 2
p
hybridization is crucial for stabilizing spontaneous displacements of
d
0
Ti
4+
cations
6
. In contrast, Hf is a 5
d
element, and the Hf–O bonds are largely ionic in nature, contributing to the large band gap of HfO
2
. Second, it has been found that the polar phases of HfO
2
are energetically higher than the nonpolar ground-state phase in bulk, highlighting the importance of exploring metastable ferroelectric materials. Last but not least, unlike primarily cation-driven ferroelectricity in perovskite oxides, the inversion symmetry breaking in HfO
2
’s polar phases is mainly due to local displacements of oxygen anions. This distinction is crucial for understanding why hafnia-based ferroelectrics are more susceptible to oxygen vacancies compared to their perovskite counterparts. It also opens the possibility of bypassing the well-known
d
0
requirement
7
of ferroelectric perovskites, potentially leading to the design of new multiferroic materials
8
,
9
that combine ferroelectricity with ferromagnetism or even superconductivity
10
.
Several review articles have already summarized different aspects of ferroelectric hafnia, including the properties and origin of ferroelectricity in HfO
2
-based materials
11
, their applications
12
, the effects of oxygen defects and dopants
13
, and issues related to device reliability and performance
14
,
15
. This review is dedicated to the computational efforts undertaken to decipher the ferroelectric mechanisms in HfO
2
. Despite its chemical simplicity, HfO
2
hosts a plethora of complexities, some of which uniquely differ from perovskite ferroelectrics. This review begins with an examination of hafnia polymorphs in the section ‘Diverse structural polymorphs’, where we compare various polar phases that have been proposed to explain the ferroelectricity observed in thin films produced by different techniques. The metastable nature of the polar phases of HfO
2
has led to debates over the exact symmetry of the ferroelectric phase. By carefully analyzing numerous studies in this field, we aim to address the causes behind contradictory theoretical reports as well as discrepancies between theoretical and experimental findings. We suggest that the most likely ferroelectric phase is the
P
c
a
2
1
phase, and its “rhombohedrally distorted” state could also explain experimental indications of a rhombohedral symmetry.
A major challenge in fabricating ferroelectric hafnia-based thin films is to reduce the volume fractions of nonpolar phases while promoting the presence of the desired ferroelectric phases. In the section ‘Stabilization mechanisms of ferroelectric phases’, we will discuss various extrinsic factors suggested theoretically to contribute to the stabilization, either thermodynamically or kinetically, of ferroelectric phases. Due to the intricacies and high computational costs of modeling the effects of dopants and oxygen vacancies, results from computational studies, primarily based on first-principles methods like density functional theory (DFT), are indicative but not definitive. Nevertheless, they strongly suggest that positively charged oxygen vacancies, either introduced by acceptor dopants or formed during the growth process, have a profound impact on the polymorphism kinetics. In the section ‘Ferroelectric switching’, we will discuss the main challenges limiting the applications of ferroelectric hafnia, notably the much higher coercive fields compared to perovskite ferroelectrics. DFT-based investigations have uncovered multiple competing pathways for domain switching at the unit cell level, as well as the motions of domain walls. We will clarify some subtleties and address common misconceptions about studying ferroelectric switching with DFT. The section ‘Modeling beyond DFT’ explores promising computational tools that could broaden our understanding of the dynamics of ferroelectric switching over larger time and length scales. The review concludes with a discussion of several directions for future computational modeling of ferroelectric hafnia.
Diverse structural polymorphs
Nonpolar and polar phases
The fluorite-structured HfO
2
is known to form many polymorphs despite its simple chemical composition (Fig.
1
). For bulk HfO
2
, the most stable polymorph at room temperature and ambient pressure is the monoclinic (
M
)
P
2
1
/
c
phase
16
. This stable polymorph transforms to the tetragonal (
T
)
P
4
2
/
n
m
c
phase, and then to the cubic
\(Fm\bar{3}m\)
phase with increasing temperature. Under increasing pressure, the
M
phase transitions to the antipolar orthorhombic (
A
O
)
P
b
c
a
phase. Given that all these polymorphs are nonpolar, the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia-based thin films was a surprise. The origin of the unexpected ferroelectricity has been attributed to the formation of four polar polymorphs, including two orthorhombic
P
c
a
2
1
and
P
m
n
2
1
phases, and two rhombohedral
R

m
and
R
3 phases.

The
T
phase is commonly regarded as a precursor for the formation of low-temperature phases like the nonpolar
M
phase and the polar
P
c
a
2
1
due to their low transition barriers
17
. Unlike the high-symmetry
T
phase, the structures of the
M
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases (Fig.
1
a, e) consist of alternating fourfold-coordinated (4C) and threefold-coordinated (3C) oxygen atoms. Specifically, the asymmetric displacements of the 3C oxygen atoms in
P
c
a
2
1
break the inversion symmetry and are often believed to be responsible for the emergence of the macroscopic spontaneous polarization
18
. However, as we will discuss below (see the section ‘Ferroelectric switching’), both 4C and 3C oxygen atoms may be involved in the switching process and contribute to the switching current measured in experiments. Within the energy window between the ground-state
M
phase and the metastable
P
c
a
2
1
phase, two distinct low-energy orthorhombic
P
b
c
a
phases
19
can be identified, the nonpolar
P
b
c
a
and the anitpolar
P
b
c
a
(Fig.
1
b, d), which can be viewed as mirror-reflected arrangements of
M
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases, respectively. Note that a recent DFT study predicted a new polar monoclinic
P
c
phase as another mirror-reflected interphase (Fig.
1
c), with an energy lower than that of the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase
20
. This prediction was supported by indicative evidence from images obtained through scanning transmission electron microscopy
21
. Another polar orthorhombic phase,
P
m
n
2
1
, with energy higher than
P
c
a
2
1
, has been theoretically identified by deforming the
T
phase using a DFT-based structure search method
22
. The calculated spontaneous polarization of
P
c
a
2
1
and
P
m
n
2
1
phases is 50.3 and 56.2 μC/cm
2
, respectively.
Additionally, two high-energy polar rhombohedral phases,
R
3
m
and
R
3, have also been proposed
23
. In DFT calculations, these two rhombohedral phases can be modeled with either a 36-atom hexagonal unit cell or a 12-atom pseudocubic unit cell. The DFT results suggest that the unstrained
R
3
m
phase has a negligible polarization of 0.1 μC/cm
2
23
, indicating that it can be considered nonpolar. This unstrained phase is nearly identical to the nonpolar cubic
\(P\bar{4}3m\)
phase
24
. A polar
R
3
m
phase can only be obtained by applying a giant in-plane equibiaxial strain within the (111)-oriented hexagonal supercell of
\(P\bar{4}3m\)
(Table
1
and Fig.
2
). Notably, even with a 5% in-plane compressive strain, the polarization is limited to 24.6 μC/cm
2
, which is significantly lower than that of the
P
c
a
2
1
phase. Therefore, based on DFT analysis, we suggest that the
P
c
a
2
1
phase is intrinsically the most plausible candidate for the ferroelectric phase in hafnia-based thin films, given its thermodynamic stability and polarization value that closely align with experimental results.

Characterization of the ferroelectric phase
Ferroelectricity in hafnia-based thin films has been attributed to the orthorhombic
P
c
a
2
1
phase since its discovery
1
,
25
,
26
,
27
. Other polar phases, including the orthorhombic
P
m
n
2
1
22
,
28
, as well as the rhombohedral
R
3
m
23
,
29
,
30
and
R
3
23
,
31
phases, have also been proposed to account for the observed ferroelectricity in different thin films on various substrates. A broad debate persisted in recent years over the exact ferroelectric phase, particularly between the orthorhombic
P
c
a
2
1
and rhombohedral
R
3
m
phases. Due to the metastable nature of both phases, as-grown thin films often contain nonpolar phases, complicating phase determination in experiments.
The
R
3
m
phase was initially suggested by Wei et al. to explain the observed rhombohedral symmetry, characterized by a deviation of the out-of-plane interplanar spacing,
d
111
, from the in-plane spacings,
\({d}_{11\bar{1}}\)
,
\({d}_{1\bar{1}1}\)
, and
\({d}_{\bar{1}11}\)
, in Hf
0.5
Zr
0.5
O
2
(HZO) epitaxial thin films grown on (La, Sr)MnO
3
(LSMO) electrode and SrTiO
3
(STO) substrate with pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
23
. Based on the electron microscopy analysis, particularly the observation of forbidden spots in selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, such as (001) and (1
\(\bar{1}\)
0) in the [110] zone-axis pattern as well as (100) spot in the [101] zone-axis pattern, the authors suggested that the phase is non-orthorhombic and classified it as rhombohedral. DFT calculations in the same work revealed that inducing substantial polarization in the
R
3
m
phase requires a giant in-plane strain, which was confirmed in a recent DFT investigation
24
. Specifically, a
d
111
of 3.28 Å, corresponding to an in-plane compressive strain of 5%, can only induce a polarization of 24.6 μC/cm
2
, smaller than the experimental value of 34 μC/cm
2
. However, the experimental value of
d
111
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements is at most 3.27 Å (only in the thinnest film of 1.5 nm). The values of
d
111
reported in subsequent experimental studies of epitaxial ferroelectric hafnia-based films typically range between 2.95 and 3.02 Å
31
,
32
,
33
,
34
, indicating a lack of large in-plane compressive strain. Moreover, due to the large lattice mismatch between LSMO and HZO, HZO films grown on LSMO/STO adopt the domain-matching epitaxy (DME)
35
,
36
, which often results in small in-plane strains, making it unlikely that a strain necessary to polarize the
R
3
m
phase can be imposed.
Another polar rhombohedral phase,
R
3, has also been considered to explain the ferroelectricity in epitaxial HZO/LSMO/STO thin films
23
. In contrast to the
R
3
m
phase, the
R
3 phase is inherently polar at its unstrained state (Table
1)
. Bégon-Lours et al. reported rhombohedral symmetry in HZO thin films grown on the GaN(0001)/Si(111) substrate and attributed it to the formation of
R
3 phase
31
, although the reported rhombohedral distortion angle (0.6°) is still considerably smaller than that (1.3°) in the
R
3 phase.
The hypothesis of rhombohedral
R
3
m
and
R
3 phases has been questioned due to their high intrinsic energies (Table
1)
and the discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results as discussed above
24
,
28
,
34
. Qi et al. simulated the SAED patterns of various HfO
2
polymorphs and found that the pattern of the orthorhombic
P
m
n
2
1
phase aligns closely with the experimental observations, suggesting that the kinetically stabilized
P
m
n
2
1
could explain the observed ferroelectricity in these films
28
. Yun et al. suggested that the rhombohedral symmetry might not be intrinsic to the polar phase in thin films and could instead arise from the “rhombohedral distortion” within the orthorhombic
P
c
a
2
1
phase (with a distortion angle of approximately 0.25–0.41°)
34
. Their DFT calculations indicated that a distortion angle of 0.4° only slightly increases the energy of the
P
c
a
2
1
phase by 6 meV per unit cell, suggesting a relatively flat potential energy surface under rhombohedral distortion. A recent DFT high-throughput (HT) study demonstrated that the
P
c
a
2
1
phase remains the most stable polar phase across a broad range of epitaxial conditions
24
. Introducing rhombohedral distortion to (111)-oriented
P
c
a
2
1
can also result in XRD spectra featuring different
d
111
,
\({d}_{11\bar{1}}\)
,
\({d}_{1\bar{1}1}\)
, and
\({d}_{\bar{1}11}\)
spacings. Nevertheless, given the complexity in polycrystalline thin films, we do not rule out the emergence of polar rhombohedral phases due to extrinsic factors.
Electron microscopy analysis with computational modeling
Electron microscopy studies play a pivotal and immensely helpful role in investigating hafnia-based ferroelectrics, particularly in determining their phases and symmetries
37
,
38
. In the quest to determine phase and symmetry, direct imaging techniques such as high-angle annular dark-field image (HAADF), annular bright-field image (ABF), and ptychography
39
, along with SAED and convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED)
40
, are broadly employed. Typically, when the oxygen lattice is visible, the phase or symmetry can be unambiguously determined, although this often requires additional efforts, including stringent criteria for sample thickness and minimal misalignment from the exact zone axis, with even stricter tolerances than those for HAADF imaging
41
. In some cases, employing only HAADF imaging to determine the phase and symmetry is simpler. For instance, Sang et al. utilized atomic-scale HAADF image to analyze atomic positions and lattice parameters, directly identifying the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase of HfO
2
in thin films for the first time (Fig.
3
a)
27
. However, when using HAADF imaging alone, extra caution is necessary as projections along different zone axes with varying symmetries may appear quite similar, leading to potential errors. For example, the Hf lattice in the [1
\(\bar{1}\)
0] and [10
\(\bar{1}\)
] zone axes of the orthorhombic phase closely resembles that of the [100] zone axis of the tetragonal phase. To differentiate these phases, a deeper analysis involving a quantitative examination of the lattice rectangle ratio is essential; for the orthorhombic phase along the [10
\(\bar{1}\)
] zone axis, the ratio is 1.39, whereas for the tetragonal phase along the [100] zone axis, it is 1.45 (Fig.
3
b).

Regarding the electron diffraction method, SAED is typically quite useful and straightforward for differentiating symmetries, as different symmetries have distinct diffraction extinction conditions. Nonetheless, it is essential to exercise caution given the dynamic effects observed in electron diffraction patterns, such as the appearance of forbidden spots caused by secondary diffraction
42
. In the case of HfO
2
, additional caution is warranted due to the susceptibility of the phase and symmetry to modifications imposed by substrate constraints or local strain states. This is particularly important in polycrystalline and multiphase thin films, where the local structure is more complex
43
,
44
. As a result, a variety of phase variants may occur
24
, which may be only slightly distorted from their ideal original symmetries such that certain indicative spots that typically differentiate between phases may lose their reliability.
Consider the rhombohedral phase as an illustration
23
. The presence of the (110) and (001) spots in the [1
\(\bar{1}\)
0] zone-axis pattern, forbidden in the original orthorhombic phase, has historically been taken as determinative evidence for the existence of the rhombohedral phase (Fig.
3
c). However, our study has revealed that even a slightly distorted orthorhombic phase can produce both the (110) and (001) spots (Fig.
3
d). Such a phase has been demonstrated to be more energetically favorable than the original orthorhombic phase and possesses polar characteristics. Given the complexity of symmetries in HfO
2
, prioritizing CBED over SAED for accurate symmetry determination is advisable. Additionally, a more comprehensive analysis that combines real- and reciprocal-space information is likely to be more effective in accurately characterizing the material’s properties.
Symmetry mode analysis of
P

Experimentally, hafnia-based thin films appear to be immune to the depolarization effect
3
that destabilizes spontaneous polarization in perovskite ferroelectric thin films. Lee et al. proposed that the
P
c
a
2
1
phase of HfO
2
is a material realization of flat phonon bands, resulting in intrinsically localized electric dipoles
2
that are less affected by domain walls and surface exposure. Additionally, the in-phase condensation of polar
\({\Gamma }_{15}^{z}\)
and anti-polar
\({Y}_{5}^{z}\)
lattice modes in the cubic phase leads to alternating layers of 4C and 3C oxygen atoms in the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase (Fig.
4
a), suggesting an improper nature of ferroelectricity. Delodovici et al. developed a Landau free energy model using the
C
c
c
e
phase as the reference
45
, based on DFT calculations. This model revealed that a trilinear coupling between a polar unstable zone-center mode and two stable zone-boundary modes, with nonpolar and polar features, drives the ferroelectric phase transition in HfO
2
. In comparison, Zhou et al. started with the cubic
\(Fm\bar{3}m\)
phase and bridged the pathway connecting
\(Fm\bar{3}m\)
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases with tetragonal, antipolar, and polar modes
46
. The high-symmetry
\(Fm\bar{3}m\)
phase transforms to tetragonal
P
4
2
/
n
m
c
under the tetragonal-mode deformation. Subsequent inclusion of the antipolar mode leads to an antipolar
P
b
c
n
phase. The polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase is then obtained by further incorporating the polar mode into the
P
b
c
n
structure. They suggested that a tensile strain along the tetragonal-mode direction triggers a phase transition from
P
4
2
/
n
m
c
to
P
b
c
n
(Fig.
4
b). Moreover, strong cooperative coupling between the polar and antipolar modes facilitates a second phase transition from
P
b
c
n
to
P
c
a
2
1
46
. Raeliarijaona and Cohen
47
later pointed out that depending on the choice of parent phase during the symmetry mode analysis
22
,
45
,
48
, ferroelectric HfO
2
could be viewed as either an improper or proper ferroelectric. Their conclusion is that ferroelectric hafnia is a proper ferroelectric, as there is a single polar soft mode connecting the parent antipolar
P
b
c
n
phase to the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase, whereas
P

m
c
is the parent nonpolar phase for the polar
P
m
n
2
1
phase (Fig.

47
. More recently, Aramberri and Íñiguez, assuming a uniaxial ferroic order for HfO
2
, developed a theoretical framework using the
P
b
c
m
phase as the reference state, which connects all low-energy polymorphs such as

In general, identifying symmetry-adapted lattice modes that contribute to the ferroelectric phase in HfO
2
is crucial for establishing appropriate order parameters, which form the foundation for developing perturbation theories, including phenomenological Ginzburg–Landau free-energy models, effective Hamiltonians
49
, and second-principles potentials
50
. Developing such computationally efficient thermodynamic models will be helpful in improving our understanding of the ferroelectric behavior of HfO
2
in a physically transparent manner.
Given the prevalence of several reference phases in the literature, it is natural to wonder which one is the most suitable. The answer to this question is not straightforward, as each reference state offers distinct advantages. For example, the break of the fourfold axis of the
T
phase naturally leads to four symmetry-equivalent domains, which conveniently explains the experimental observations of 90° domain walls
51
,
52
,
53
, justifying the choice of the
T
phase as the high-symmetry reference structure
46

phase lacks polar instability

phase as the reference naturally explains this soft-mode-driven proper ferroelectric behavior. The unified description of all low-energy polymorphs starting with the
P

c

phase is evidently appealing
48
, although this phase seems irrelevant for the lowest-energy-switching pathway at the unit cell level (see the section ‘Ferroelectric switching’). We note that our large-scale MD simulations reveal both temperature-driven

, depending on the composition of hafnia (see the section ‘Modeling beyond DFT’). This suggests that variations in composition, along with the accompanying strain effects, can influence the nature of ferroelectric phase transitions in hafnia-based ferroelectrics. Therefore, a productive approach would be to combine MD simulations with symmetry mode analysis. The former identifies atomistic mechanisms with reduced human bias, while the latter provides a clearer physical interpretation.
Stabilization mechanisms of ferroelectric phases
Unlike conventional perovskite-based ferroelectrics, where polar phases are the ground states below the Curie temperature, the polar phases of HfO
2
are all metastable compared to the nonpolar
M
phase. A fundamental challenge in fabricating hafnia-based ferroelectric thin films is suppressing the formation of the nonpolar
M
phase while promoting the emergence of the desired ferroelectric phases. Various extrinsic factors, such as oxygen vacancies, dopants, strain, electric fields, and surface and interface effects, have been proposed theoretically to contribute to the stabilization of ferroelectric phases, either thermodynamically or kinetically.
Surface and interface
Experimental studies have shown that hafnia-based ferroelectrics exhibit a
reverse
size effect, where polarization increases as film thickness decreases
3
,
55
. This unusual thickness-dependence of ferroelectricity in hafnia-based thin films has been attributed to the surface energy effect
3
. Materlik et al. built a free energy model that includes the surface energy term (
γ
), indicating that the ferroelectric
P
c
a
2
1
phase can be stabilized at a grain size of 3–5 nm over the
M
phase
56
. However, later comprehensive surface energy calculations considering major crystallographic planes revealed that the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase possesses higher surface energy than the nonpolar
M
and
T
phases (
γ
O
>
γ
M
>
γ
T
, see Table
2
)
57
,
58
,
59
. Batra et al. reported that the polar
P
m
n
2
1
phase has the lowest surface energy in (001) orientation and proposed that the effect of surface energy could stabilize the polar
P
m
n
2
1
phase and the nonpolar precursor
T
phase, which can then transform into the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase
57
. It was suggested that concerted effects of surface energy and dopants could thermodynamically stabilize the
T
phase, followed by a transition into the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase during the thermal annealing process
58
. The surface effect has also been used to explain the stabilization of the polar rhombohedral
R
3
m
phase in ultrathin films
60
,
61
. We emphasize that the calculated surface energies strongly depend on the termination, stoichiometry, and polarization direction of the slab models (Table
2)
62
,
63
,
64
. The difficulty in obtaining reliable surface energies makes it challenging to fully understand the surface effect and could lead to inconsistencies between theory and experiments
65
. Comprehensive and reliable DFT calculations of surface energies for different polymorphs of HfO
2
will be crucial to addressing this key question. Additionally, a quantitative understanding of the interface energy for the phase interface separating different polymorphs
59
,
66
would be useful in constructing a nucleation-based growth model to analyze phase transition kinetics during the annealing process in film fabrication.

The charge transfer between the metal electrode and hafnia plays an unexpected role in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase, as highlighted in recent experimental findings. Shi et al. observed enhanced ferroelectricity in HZO thin films grown on MnO
2
-terminated LSMO by intentionally engineering the HZO/LSMO interface
67
. This enhancement was attributed to hole doping from MnO
2
-terminated LSMO into hafnia, which thermodynamically promotes the formation of the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase over the nonpolar
M
phase. Currently, theoretical studies on interface effects, particularly the interplay between charge transfer and structural polymorphism, remain limited, partly because large-scale interface models are needed to simulate experimental domain-matching systems.
Epitaxial strain
Strain engineering of ferroelectric perovskites through thin-film epitaxy has significantly advanced the understanding of ferroelectric physics and led to the discovery of novel topological polar structures
68
,
69
,
70
. By leveraging the lattice mismatch between ferroelectric perovskites and their substrates, various degrees of freedom, such as spin, charge, and domain, can be tailored to realize new functionalities
71
. Epitaxial strain is often cited as an important factor for stabilizing the metastable
P
c
a
2
1
phase in hafnia thin films, but the situation is more complex than it might seem.
Experimentally, hafnia-based thin films grown on different substrates can adopt two distinct types of epitaxy. One is the conventional lattice-matching epitaxy (LME), also known as cube-on-cube epitaxy, where one film lattice coherently matches one substrate lattice. This type of epitaxy is likely to be observed in hafnia films grown on substrates with similar lattice parameters, such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and indium–tin–oxide (ITO)
26
,
72
,
73
. The other type is the domain-matching epitaxy (DME), where
m
lattices of film match
n
lattices of the substrate. The DME-type interface is usually found in films grown on largely mismatched substrates, such as (La,Sr)MnO
3
(LSMO). The formation of
m
/
n
domains effectively reduces the actual lattice mismatch and relieves the epitaxial stress
35
,
36
. In this regard, hafnia in thin films with DME might not experience significant straining.
The effects of equibiaxial strain on the thermodynamic ordering of hafnia polymorphs have been extensively studied. In these DFT-based investigations, the equibiaxial strain is applied by scaling the lattice vectors by the same percentage while conserving the in-plane lattice angle. Batra et al. found that the in-plane equibiaxial compressive strain above ~2.5% will make
P
c
a
2
1
with in-plane polarization more stable than
M
, but the antipolar
P
b
c
a
phase is always lower in energy than
P
c
a
2
1
74
. Fan et al. reached a similar conclusion for compressive strains and found that a tensile strain larger than 3% could make
P
c
a
2
1
more stable than the antipolar
P
b
c
a
phase, but it would still be higher in energy compared to the nonpolar
M
phase
75
. These results imply that equibiaxial strain alone cannot make (001)-oriented
P
c
a
2
1
the most stable compared to the
M
or
P
b
c
a
phases.
Liu and Hanrahan were the first to theoretically examine the collective effects of growth orientations and equibiaxial strains on the phase stability of HfO
2
76
. Based on the phase transition barriers computed with the variable-cell nudged elastic band (NEB) technique, it was suggested that the transformation from the
T
phase to the
P
c
a
2
1
phase is kinetically faster than to the antipolar
P
b
c
a
phase, which shifts the focus to the thermodynamic competition between the
P
c
a
2
1
and
M
phases. They reported that the (111)-oriented
P
c
a
2
1
is thermodynamically more stable than the nonpolar
M
phase under in-plane compressive strain
76
. In contrast, Chae et al. reached a different conclusion, reporting that the in-plane tensile strain (>4.2%) favors the
P
c
a
2
1
phase over the
M
phase
77
. These conflicting conclusions stemmed from the fact that the
M
phase has symmetrically non-equivalent (111) and (11
\(\bar{1}\)
) planes, while the former study did not consider the (11
\(\bar{1}\)
)-orientated
M
phase. It is worth noting that when all {111} crystallographic orientations are taken into account, the
M
phase remains the most stable under any in-plane equibiaxial strain conditions
60
.
The combined effects of strain and other extrinsic factors have been proposed to enhance the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Batra et al. suggested that the combination of in-plane equibiaxial compressive strain and an in-plane electric field can stabilize the
P
c
a
2
1
phase as the ground state
74
, although the electric field required is relatively large (≈2 MV/cm). Bai et al. introduced a coupling effect of the uniaxial strain, electric field, and oxygen vacancies, suggesting that this mechanical-electrical-chemical coupling can promote the stabilization of the
P
c
a
2
1
phase
78
. However, it remains unclear how to achieve the necessary multi-factor control in experimental conditions, especially during the film growth process.
The impact of equibiaxial strain on other polar phases, such as
R
3
m
and
P
m
n
2
1
has been examined. As discussed earlier, the polar
R
3
m
phase is induced by applying a (111) in-plane equibiaxial compressive strain
23
,
24
,
60
to an otherwise nonpolar
\(P\bar{4}3m\)
phase
24
. However, the high intrinsic energy and large strain required to induce polarization present obstacles to stabilizing this phase. Zhang et al. argued that a concerted effect of epitaxial strain and surface energy could favor the
R
3
m
phase in ultrathin films
60
. Another study compared the relative stability of
R
3
m
and
M
phases on a ZnO(0001) substrate, indicating that trigonal symmetry imposed by this substrate might facilitate the stabilization of the
R
3
m
phase
33
, though a distorted
P
c
a
2
1
phase remains a possibility. Meanwhile, Qi et al. found that a (111) in-plane shear strain could drive
T
→
P
m
n
2
1
phase transition, proposing the kinetically stabilized
P
m
n
2
1
as an alternate cause of ferroelectricity in films grown on the LSMO/STO(001) substrate
28
.
These DFT-based studies have mainly focused on the equibiaxial strain effect, implying strain alone is insufficient to stabilize the ferroelectric
P
c
a
2
1
phase as the ground state. However, the epitaxial matching between hafnia-based thin films and their substrates can result in more complex strain conditions, involving both normal (not necessarily equibiaxial) and shear strains due to the low symmetries of relevant HfO
2
phases
24
. When growing on a specific substrate, the exact strain conditions depend not only on the matching plane but also on the crystallized phase. As shown in Fig.
5
a, in {110}-oriented thin films, four distinct growth orientations are available for
M
, but only three for
P
c
a
2
1
; their strain conditions for each when grown on the same substrate will be drastically different. Additionally, different epitaxy types, LME and DME, can lead to varying strain conditions. The high-throughput (HT) DFT study by Zhu et al. systematically evaluated the thermodynamic stability of disparate crystallographic planes and various nonpolar/polar phases under differing epitaxial conditions, showing that shear strain due to orthogonal in-plane lattice constraints imposed by the substrate could thermodynamically favor the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase in
\(\left\{110\right\}\)
and (111) growth orientations over other polar forms (
P
m
n
2
1
,
R
3
m
, and
R
3), and even nonpolar
M
phase
24
. These DFT predictions (Fig.
5
b) are confirmed by a recent experimental study where Barriuso et al. achieved selective growth of
M
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases of HZO on (001)- and (111)-oriented YSZ substrates (Fig.
5
c), respectively
79
. It should be noted that these DFT investigations utilized the single-domain approximation to reduce computational costs, overlooking the effects of domain structures on thermodynamic stability. Moreover, while the strain effect on the ferroelectric properties of hafnia- and zirconia-based thin films has been clearly demonstrated
80
,
81
, there is limited theoretical research on the impact of strain on the kinetic barriers of structural polymorphism. Developing phase-field methods based on accurate thermodynamic potentials of hafnia polymorphs will enhance our understanding of how domain structures and phase mixtures influence the thermodynamic stability of hafnia thin films.

Oxygen vacancies
Long before the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO
2
thin film, oxygen-deficient hafnia (HfO
2−
x
) garnered attention for its potential applications in non-volatile resistive random-access memory devices, where the reversible formation and disruption of conductive filaments composed of chain-like oxygen vacancies were key. Given the significance of oxygen vacancies in HfO
2
, it is not entirely unexpected that they also play a crucial role in ferroelectric hafnia as well.
Indeed, many experimental studies have emphasized the significant impact of oxygen vacancies on the ferroelectric properties of hafnia-based thin films. Pal et al. found that reducing the oxidant dose during atomic layer deposition (ALD) could suppress the formation of the nonpolar
M
phase, resulting in up to sixfold improvement in remnant polarization in sub-10 nm HfO
2
films without dopants
82
. Materano et al. also reported that high oxygen contents promote the stabilization the
M
phase, while short ozone dose times favor the formation of the
T
and ferroelectric phases in thin films deposited by ALD and physical vapor deposition (PVD)
83
. Nukala et al. emphasized oxygen vacancies as the electrochemical origin of ferroelectricity in hafnia-based compounds by demonstrating reversible migrations of oxygen vacancies and the associated phase transitions employing electron microscopy imaging
29
. Other phenomena, such as wake-up and fluid imprint, have also been attributed to the redistribution of oxygen vacancies
84
,
85
.
A typical approach for modeling an oxygen vacancy in DFT calculations is to remove an oxygen atom from a supercell of HfO
2
, effectively creating a charge-neutral oxygen vacancy (
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
). Due to the high computational cost, most DFT investigations used supercells with no more than 216 oxygen atoms, which restricts modeling to relatively high concentrations of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
. Zhou et al. found that an increasing concentration of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
tends to reduce the energy difference between the
P
c
a
2
1
and
M
phases
86
. However, even at a high
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
concentration of 12.5 f.u.%, the
M
phase remains to be much more stable than the
P
c
a
2
1
phase by 18 meV per unit cell (Fig.
6
a). Rushchanskii et al. considered the role of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
in the phase transition between
M
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases
87
. Using a supercell model of oxygen-deficient HfO
2−
δ
with
δ
= 0.25, they found that oxygen vacancies form two-dimensional extended defects based on a DFT-driven evolutionary algorithm. Interestingly, the two lowest-energy configurations of the
M
phase exhibit distinct transition behaviors: the lowest-energy configuration kinetically favors the transition to the ferroelectric
P
c
a
2
1
phase, whereas the second-lowest-energy configuration tends to become the
T
phase (Fig.
6
b). But again, the
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
concentration in this model reached 12.5 f.u.%, much higher than typical experimental values of 2–3 f.u.%
82
,
88
. Materano et al. proposed a model in which oxygen vacancies and interstitial can modulate the transition barrier from
T
to
P
c
a
2
1
and
M
phase during crystallization
83
, but the impact is not very significant. The weak
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
effect predicted by DFT seems inconsistent with various experimental evidence indicating a significant impact of oxygen vacancies.

Impact of charge-neutral oxygen vacancies (

promotes

can activate both nonpolar-to-polar and polar-to-nonpolar phase transitions. Panels

It was later realized that the charge state of oxygen vacancy could reconcile this experimental-theoretical discrepancy. He et al. computed the diffusion barriers for
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
and the doubly positively charged oxygen vacancy (
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
)
89
. Given that HfO
2
has a large band gap, an intuitive understanding of the electronic structure of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
is that it represents two electrons localized at the vacancy site. Further extraction of those two electrons (equivalent to hole doping) leads to
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
. It was found that
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
exhibits a large diffusion barrier of >2.4 eV in both
M
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases, making it nearly immobile. In contrast,
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
has a much lower diffusion barrier, below 1 eV (Fig.
6
c), suggesting that these charged oxygen vacancies are likely responsible for the observed reversible oxygen vacancy migrations in experiments
29
. It was reported that beyond a critical concentration of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
, the
P
c
a
2
1
phase could be thermodynamically more stable than the
M
phase
89
. Subsequent comprehensive calculations of different configurations of
M
and
P
c
a
2
1
phases, however, demonstrated that the lowest-energy configuration of the
M
phase remains more favorable than the lowest-energy configuration of the
P
c
a
2
1
phase
17
. Although the presence of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
does not reverse the energetic ordering, Ma and Liu discovered that even at a low concentration of 3.125 f.u.%, local ordering of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
can drastically modulate the relative configurational stability of the same phase
17
. For example, a configuration of the
T
phase becomes highly unstable when
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{0}\)
becomes
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
(due to electron entrapment), and its transformation to the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase has a lower kinetic barrier of 24 meV/f.u., compared to 54 meV/f.u. for the
T
→
M
transition. By mapping out the phase transition network involving multiple polymorphs of HfO
2
containing
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
, it was suggested that these charged vacancies act like “catalysts”, enabling various previously forbidden transitions among polar and nonpolar phases (Fig.
6
d). The robust structural polymorphism kinetics promoted by
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
could explain the emergence of polar phases in hafnia thin films, as well as wake-up effects, fluid imprinting, and inertial switching. The significance of the charge state of oxygen vacancy underscores the importance of quantifying their formation energies. Several investigations
90
,
91
,
92
have demonstrated that as the Fermi level decreases, the formation energy of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
in hafnia becomes negative.
The necessity of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
for promoting the formation of the
P
c
a
2
1
phase aligns with a substantial body of experimental data indicating that nearly all cation dopants inducing ferroelectricity in HfO
2
-based thin films are
p
-type. This is because substituting Hf
4+
with acceptor dopants such as Y
3+
naturally leads to the formation of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
to maintain charge neutrality. The confirmation of intrinsic ferroelectricity in Y-doped HfO
2
thin films, which exhibit a large remnant polarization of 64 μC/cm
2
, serves as an excellent example
34
. Similarly, the emergence of ferroelectricity in N-doped HfO
2
93
is likely due to
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
, which compensates for
\({{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{O}}}^{-}\)
. Additionally, the mechanism of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
-promoted nonpolar-polar structural polymorphism helps explain why light ion bombardment significantly enhances ferroelectricity in HfO
2
-based thin films
94
.
We would like to offer a few general comments regarding the subtleties of DFT modeling of oxygen vacancies. First, the charge state of oxygen vacancy is controlled by adjusting the number of electrons in the supercell, with the background charge method employed to maintain the charge neutrality of the whole system when modeling
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
. A more realistic approach to introducing
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
is to replace Hf atoms with divalent or trivalent dopants such as Ca
2+
and La
3+
, and then compensate for the charge by removing oxygen atoms. Typical acceptor-centered defect complexes are
\([{({{\rm{Ca}}}_{{\rm{Hf}}}^{\prime\prime}-{V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{\cdot \cdot })}^{\times }]\)
and
\([{(2{{\rm{La}}}_{{\rm{Hf}}}^{{\prime} }-{V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{\cdot \cdot })}^{\times }]\)
, where
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{\cdot \cdot }\)
is the Kröger–Vink notation of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
. We believe it is worth investigating the interplay between the charge state of oxygen vacancies and polymorphism kinetics with realistic defect pairs. Second, caution is advised when discussing the impacts of oxygen vacancies on the energetic ordering of hafnia polymorphs, due to the large number of possible oxygen-deficient configurations for the same phase. Identifying the lowest-energy configuration of a given phase is highly nontrivial, especially since the size of the configuration space grows exponentially with the supercell size. Lastly, there exist multiple pathways connecting two phases, depending on the choice of atom-to-atom mapping in DFT-based NEB calculations. An important guiding principle for pathway construction is to ensure the pathway conserves the sign of
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode (see discussions below), as failing to do so could lead to misinterpretation of the impact of oxygen vacancies on phase transition kinetics.
Dopants
Because ferroelectric hafnia was first discovered in Si-doped HfO
2
, the effects of doping have attracted great attention from the outset. A number of experimental studies have investigated the impact of various substitutional dopants, such as acceptors, donors, and homovalent dopants, on the ferroelectric properties of hafnia-based thin films
95
,
96
,
97
. Most cation dopants inducing ferroelectricity in HfO
2
-based thin films are acceptors such as La
3+
and Y
3+
. This aligns with the theory discussed above that
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
facilitates nonpolar-to-polar phase transitions, as acceptor dopants naturally introduce
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
to maintain charge neutrality. Yu et al. proposed that La
3+
doping significantly reduces the formation enthalpy of oxygen vacancies by pushing down the Fermi level, leading to a moderate concentration of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
in most of the chemical potential regions
98
. Likewise, the emergence of ferroelectricity in nitrogen-doped HfO
2
may result from
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
compensating for the negative charge of
\({{\rm{N}}}_{{\rm{O}}}^{-}\)
93
.
Batra et al. examined the effects of nearly 40 different dopants on the stability of hafnia phases based on HT-DFT calculations and a three-stage down-selection strategy
99
. Although none of the dopants make the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase the most stable, divalent and trivalent dopants like Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Y, and Gd, along with appropriate charge-neutralizing oxygen vacancies, reduce the energy of the polar phase relative to the
M
phase considerably (Fig.
7
a)
99
. It was inferred that dopants such as Ca, Sr, Ba, and Y, with larger ionic radii and lower electronegativity, are the most effective in stabilizing the polar phase, attributed to the stronger additional bonds formed between the dopant cation and the second-nearest oxygen neighbors. Interestingly, this principle does not fully explain the significance of La as a dopant, which is the most widely used and effective in promoting ferroelectricity in experiments
100
. Materlik et al. arrived at a somewhat different conclusion
101
when investigating three types of defects associated with trivalent dopants, the electronically compensated
X
Hf
, the mixed compensated
X
Hf

O
, and the ionically compensated (2
X

)
V

, with
X
= Al, Y, and La (Fig.

b). Technically, the modeling of
X
Hf
and
X
Hf
V
O
employed a combination of adjusting electron numbers and the background charge method to ensure that the oxidation state of
X
remains +3. This study found that for Y- and La-doping,
X

V
O
and (2

V
O
strongly favor the tetragonal and cubic phases over the ferroelectric
P

phase at a high doping concentration of 12.5 f.u.%. A similar conclusion was reached for Sr-doped HfO
2
, where the introduction of vacancies in combination with the Sr dopants destabilizes the ferroelectric phase
102
. These findings are not entirely consistent with the theory of
\({V}_{{\rm{O}}}^{2+}\)
-promoted ferroelectricity

Four-valent dopants generally result in robust stabilization of the
T
phase but only weakly stabilize the
P
c
a
2
1
phase (Fig.

103
. Specifically, C, Ge, and Ti barely change the energy difference between the
P

2
1
and
M
phases, while Sn and Ce exhibit a small stabilization effect on the
P
c
a
2

phase. Notably, Si stands out as a unique case, significantly promoting both the
P
c
a
2
1
and
T
phases, with a particularly strong impact on the latter
104
. The stabilization of the
P
c
a
2
1
phase by silicon doping has been attributed to the adoption of the more favorable six-fold coordination compared to the less favorable five-fold coordination in the competing
M
phases
103
. Nevertheless, a Si doping concentration of up to 12.5 f.u.% is not enough to favor the
P
c
a
2
1
over the
M
phase.
Another four-valent dopant deserving special attention is Zr. Due to the lanthanide contraction, Hf
4+
and Zr
4+
have nearly identical ionic radii, leading to similar properties. As a result, HfO
2
and ZrO
2
are isostructural, undergoing similar temperature- and pressure-driven phase transitions. They can form single-phase solid solutions over the entire composition range
65
,
105
. Both ZrO
2
and HfO
2
can adopt the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase
106
, but ZrO
2
typically favors the formation of the
T
phase in thin films, giving rise to antiferroelectric-like polarization-electric field hysteresis loops
25
. The mixed system of Hf
x
Zr
1−
x
O
2
(HZO) can support ferroelectricity for a wide range of values of
x
without further doping. Moreover, HZO thin films could be crystallized at lower temperatures than those based on HfO
2
, providing an advantage during the integration process
105
. Despite the similarities between Hf and Zr, explaining why HZO exhibits enhanced ferroelectric properties compared to pure HfO
2
remains challenging. This suggests that unique mechanisms could result from the alloying of these two elements, with further research required to understand the underlying causes. Recent experimental investigations have shown that interstitial Hf (Zr) defects can markedly reduce the coercive field of ferroelectric HZO thin films
30
, indicating the need for future theoretical studies on interstitial defects that have been relatively underexplored.
First-principles simulations of the doping effect face challenges similar to those encountered when modeling oxygen vacancies, and often even more so. The interactions among dopants, oxygen vacancies, and their charge states are inherently complex, with computational complexity increasing significantly when considering additional factors like doping concentration, spatial distribution of dopants, and the variety of hafnia polymorphs. For example, HT-DFT calculations of randomly doped HfO
2
structures with Si, La, and oxygen vacancies indicated large energy variations among doped configurations due to dopant interactions
107
. This hierarchical complexity can quickly lead to computational intractability, which explains why theoretical predictions in literature have not yet reached consistency. A promising solution could be the development of cost-efficient computational tools, such as machine-learning-based force fields, which are capable of simulating doped hafnia systems more effectively. Another important direction for understanding the doping effect is to go beyond the energy-based thermodynamic analysis, shifting the focus on the structural polymorphism kinetics, as no dopant at relatively a low concentration can make the
P
c
a
2
1
phase the ground state.
Extensive DFT investigations suggest that stabilizing the ferroelectric phase thermodynamically over the competing nonpolar
M
phase using a single extrinsic factor is quite challenging. One notable exception is that orthogonal in-plane lattice constraints imposed by substrates on {110}- and {111}-oriented thin films could make the
P
c
a
2
1
phase most stable thermodynamically, based on DFT investigations assuming a single-domain thin film with LME
24
. The emergence of the metastable ferroelectric phase in epitaxial films with DME and in polycrystalline films with stress-relieving defects, however, remains an open question. Possible methods to realistically address complexities under experimental conditions include MD simulations and phase-field modeling. With accurate potentials for hafnia polymorphs, these techniques would allow for more effective treatment of interfaces, dopants, and vacancies, as well as the simulation of phase transition kinetics.
Ferroelectric switching
Understanding the mechanisms of ferroelectric switching in hafnia-based ferroelectrics is important for addressing several critical issues, such as high coercive fields and limited endurance, which are the main obstacles hindering their applications. As illustrated in Fig.
1
a, a striking structural characteristic of the polar
P
c
a
2
1
phase is the presence of a spacing layer consisting of 4C oxygen atoms that separate 3C oxygen atoms. The 4C and 3C oxygen atoms are commonly referred to as polar oxygen (O
p
) and non-polar oxygen (O
np
), respectively. Based on the observation that O
p
and O
np
layers are arranged in alternating directions perpendicular to the polarization, Lee et al. insightfully pointed out that ferroelectric HfO
2
is a material realization of flat phonon bands, where electrical dipoles are highly localized
2
. This unusual structural feature also hints at the complexity of switching mechanisms for both domains and domain walls.
Lattice mode matching and transition pathways
We start this section by emphasizing the importance of the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
lattice mode, characterized by antiparallel
x
-displacements of neighboring oxygen atoms. The minimum energy paths (MEPs) between two given states of a system are often determined DFT-based NEB method. The performance of NEB calculations requires a predefined atomic mapping scheme, upon which the initial transition path consisting of a discreet set of configurations can be constructed. This is typically achieved by a linear interpolation of the Cartesian coordinates between the initial and final states. Depending on the atom-to-atom mapping chosen, there are multiple possible ways to connect the two states. Employing a mapping that conserves the sign of the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode results in a lower enthalpy barrier compared to pathways where this mode is reversed. For instance, the pathway preserving the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
sign between
P
c
a
2
1
and
P
4
2
/
m
m
c
(as shown in Fig.
8
a) exhibits a substantially lower enthalpy barrier of 2.5 meV/f.u., in contrast to the pathway with the reversed
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode (48 meV/f.u.). Conserving the sign of
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode is crucial to calculating of the energy barrier of both the phase transition and the polarization switching in hafnia
17
,
108
,
109
. Figure
8
b depicts the MEPs for structural polymorphisms of hafnia, obtained using variable-cell NEB (VCNEB). The main difference between NEB and VCNEB is that VCNEB accommodates changes in lattice constants during solid-solid transformations. This feature enables VCNEB to accurately quantify the intrinsic transition barriers between two phases that have different lattice constants. Ma and Liu found that the transition of

T

P
b
c
a
requires overcoming a large kinetic barrier despite the antipolar
P

17
. Additionally, transitions from the polar

phases in as-grown thin films of hafnia. It should be noted that since all these calculations are performed at zero Kelvin, quantifying the finite-temperature free energies of different phases could enhance our understanding of the kinetics of polymorphism and the emergence of ferroelectricity.

Unit-cell-level polarization switching
The alternating O
p
and O
np
layers result in multiple polarization switching pathways, even at the unit cell level
109
,
110
,
111
,
112
,
113
. These pathways can be classified as shift-inside (SI) and shift-across (SA). Specifically, the SI-1 pathway involves only the displacement of O
p
atoms, with the transition state adopting the
T
phase (
P
4
2
/
n
m
c
). In the SI-2 pathway, both O
p
and O
np
ions move against the electric field (
\({\mathcal{E}}\)
), resulting in a coordinated transition of O
np
→ O
p
and O
p
→ O
np
. In contrast, O
p
ions move across through Hf planes in the SA pathway. The energy barriers of SI-1, SI-2, and SA, calculated by DFT-based VCNEB and with the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode conserved, are 0.39, 0.22, and 0.79 eV/unitcell, respectively (Fig.
9
a)
109
. We make a brief comment on the subtle differences between the SI-2 pathways as identified with VCNEB and NEB. The former technique, which allows for lattice relaxation, predicts a
P
b
c
n
-like intermediate state
109
, whereas the latter identifies the
T
phase as the intermediate and yields a higher barrier of 0.34 eV/unitcell. Therefore, the barrier calculated using VCNEB represents a lower limit for homogeneous polarization switching, whereas the estimate obtained with NEB approximates the upper limit. The strain-dependent stability of the
P
b
c
n
phase was also discussed based on symmetry mode analysis

109
, which plots barrier versus
\(| {\mathcal{E}}|\)
, a factor of 4 for the field strength was missed. The critical switching fields (which reduce the barriers to zero) range from 8 to 16 MV/cm, higher than the values (5–8 MV/cm) estimated from finite-temperature MD simulations. This outcome aligns with the expected trend, as DFT calculations assuming homogeneous switching often overestimate the critical fields

When comparing the SI and SA pathways, it is observed that the same initial structure can undergo polarization switching driven by electric fields in opposite directions
109
,
111
. To conform with classical electrodynamics, the same structure would exhibit polarization along opposite directions in the SI and SA pathways. This counter-intuitive consequence is actually a manifestation of the geometric-quantum-phase nature of electric polarization (
P
), a multi-valued
lattice
property without a specific direction. The SI and SA pathways correspond to two branches of the polarization lattice, each associated with a well-defined polarization change Δ
P
without ambiguity (Fig.
9
b). Consequently, Ma et al. proposed that HfO
2
exhibits dual-valued remnant polarization (
\({P}_{s}^{{\rm{SI}}}=-0.5\)
C/m
2
and
\({P}_{s}^{{\rm{SA}}}=0.7\)
C/m
2
), each with distinct
\(P-{\mathcal{E}}\)
hysteresis loop
109
. Wu et al. argued that HfO
2
should exhibit an intrinsic polarization value of 0.7 C/m
2
based on the domain wall motion achieved through an SA-like mechanism, although the barrier is rather high at 0.5 eV
114
.
An interesting question naturally arises given the dual-valued remnant polarization: do the two switching pathways correspond to two distinct values of piezoelectric strain coefficient
d
33
? Liu et al. first predicted that
P
c
a
2
1
HfO
2
exhibits a negative value of
d
33
such that the lattice along the polar axis shrinks when an electric field is applied along the direction of the polarization (
\({{\mathcal{E}}}_{3}\)
)
115
. Moreover, both transverse and longitudinal piezoelectric coefficients are negative, leading to an unusual “electric auxetic effect,” where the lattice will shrink (expand) along all three dimensions when the field is applied along (against) the direction of
P
. Experimentally, both positive and negative coefficients have been observed in ferroelectric hafnia-based thin films
116
,
117
,
118
. Some studies proposed that the double-path polarization switching in hafnia is responsible for the varying piezoelectric responses observed
110
. Based on deep-learning-assisted finite-field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Ma et al. reported that an electric field driving O
p
ions away from their nearest Hf atomic layer will result in lattice expansion (
η
3
> 0), and vice versa (Fig.
9
b)
109
. Thus, for a given crystal orientation and
\({{\mathcal{E}}}_{3}\)
, the induced strain change is unique; the absolute value of
d
33
calculated using
∣
∂
η
3
/
\(\partial {{\mathcal{E}}}_{3}|\)
is single-valued, with the sign of
d
33
entirely dependent on the sign of
\({{\mathcal{E}}}_{3}\)
(the choice of the positive direction of the field is arbitrary)
109
. Another way to understand this is to recognize that the two branches of the polarization lattices corresponding to the SI and SA pathways have the same slope, supporting a single-valued
∣
d
33
∣
. Since polarization itself does not have a well-defined sign due to its geometric-quantum-phase nature, we cannot state that an electric field (a vector quantity) is “aligned along” the polarization (a multi-valued lattice property). However, the relative orientation between a field and crystal orientation can, in principle, be determined, and the resulting strain change is thus well-defined and unambiguous. Interestingly, the combined use of band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy and molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated that the
d
33
of ZrO
2
-based antiferroelectrics exhibits intriguing behavior where its sign changes with an increasing electric field, arising from the field-driven

The long-distance travel of oxygen ions through successive SI and SA transitions is similar to adiabatic Thouless pumping, achievable by applying a constant bias. Large-scale finite-field MD simulations have confirmed that the presence of a unidirectional electric field can drive successive ferroelectric switching, supporting a continuous flow of oxygen ions and high oxygen ion mobility at moderate temperatures, even in the absence of oxygen vacancies
109
. Investigating the potential interaction between ferroelectric switching and ion transport at high fields might be crucial for the development of novel hafnia-based nanoelectronics and electric-field-assisted ultrafast ion conductors.
Domain wall motion
Domain walls (DWs) are interfaces separating domains with different polarization directions. The dynamics of DWs in perovskite ferroelectrics have been extensively studied, and it is now widely acknowledged that the mobility of DWs dictates the switching speed and coercive field. Kiguchi et al. identified several types of 90° and 180° DWs in epitaxially grown Y-doped HfO
2
(YHO) films using scanning transmission electron microscopy
121
. Understanding the atomic-scale structural properties and dynamic response of DWs in ferroelectric HfO
2
is essential for addressing several critical challenges, particularly the giant coercive field that is orders of magnitude higher than their ferroelectric counterparts.
The unit cell of
P
c
a

HfO

exhibits conditional chirality: the application of Euclidean transformations within the unit cell results in eight different representations
111
. This leads to a rich spectrum of 180
∘
DWs. One of the most studied DW types is the
P
b
c
a

111
,
114
,
122
and resembles the anti-polar

b
c
a
phase at the boundary that separates oppositely polarized domains. Lee et al. simulated the motion of a
P
b
c
a
-type wall with DFT-based NEB, assuming the wall moves via the SI-1-like mechanism during which the O
p
atoms move between Hf atomic players, referred to as the “non-crossing” mechanism in later studies
2
. However, the calculated barrier is quite high, at ≈1.3 eV. Silva et al. identified a “crossing” pathway, during which the
P
b
c
a
-type wall propagates via an SA-like mechanism with O
p
atoms moving across the Hf atomic planes. The crossing pathway has a lower barrier than the non-crossing one, and La doping can further reduce the barrier to 0.4 eV
123
. Recently, Wu et al. reported similar results for
P
b
c
a
-type walls (0.51 eV for crossing and 1.04 eV for non-crossing) (Fig.
10

2
should exhibit a higher polarization value of 0.7 C/m
2
than the conventional value of 0.5 C/m
2

The reason the non-crossing pathway for the motion of a
P
b
c
a
-type wall must overcome such a large barrier is due to the requirement to flip the sign of the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode. Qi et al. investigated the switching barriers for four different types of 180° DWs in HfO
2
, distinguished by whether the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode conserves or reverses its sign across the wall (Fig.
10
a)
108
. It was pointed out that the
P
b
c
a
-type wall has the sign of the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode reversed across the wall. The MEPs identified with DFT-based NEB calculations confirmed that the walls conserving the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
sign have much lower switching barriers than those reversing it. This occurs because the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode features anti-parallel
x
-displacements of oxygen atoms, orthogonal to the direction of the polarization. This mode, not involving a net change in the local dipole moment, cannot be driven by an electric field applied orthogonally to the polarization direction. Choe et al. also found that the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
-sign-conserved walls are much more mobile than
P
b
c
a
-type walls (Fig.
10
c)
111
. We note that these results also help explain the lower barrier associated with the crossing pathway for the motion of a
P
b
c
a
-type wall: the oxygen atoms preserve their respective signs of
x
-displacements while moving across the Hf planes. Recently, Xu et al. looked into the structural and electronic properties of oxygen-vacancy-stabilized head-to-head and tail-to-tail charged DWs of ferroelectric HfO
2
124
. The non-180° DWs in HfO
2
are less explored computationally. Ding et al. computed the lateral motion barriers for several types of 90° DWs
122
, although these walls reside in the (001) planes instead of the (011) planes commonly found in perovskite ferroelectrics like PbTiO
3
.
These DFT-based computational studies have revealed extraordinary mechanistic and energetic complexities in the motion of DWs in ferroelectric HfO
2
. Although not directly related to polarization, the
\({X}_{2}^{-}\)
mode plays a significant role in both polymorphism and switching kinetics. It is well established that directly estimating the coercive field from the switching barrier typically overestimates the value by several orders of magnitude
125
. Gaining a deeper understanding of the thermally activated nucleation and growth
126
,
127
processes at the wall is necessary for making accurate quantitative predictions of coercive fields in the future.
Modeling beyond DFT
In previous discussions, we have mainly focused on results obtained with zero-Kelvin DFT calculations. It has become evident that the properties of HfO
2
-based ferroelectric devices are strongly influenced by various kinetic and dynamic processes that span multiple time and spatial scales
128
,
129
. Particularly during phase transitions, kinetic effects such as those occurring during annealing and cooling processes are critical for forming and stabilizing the metastable ferroelectric
P
c
a
2
1
phase. The dynamical processes involved in domain and DW switching govern the switching speed and coercive field, thereby affecting write speed and power consumption
127
,
130
. A deeper understanding of the phase transition kinetics and polarization switching dynamics in HfO
2
and its doped variants could hold the key to improving the viability of hafnia-based devices. The high computational cost of DFT limits the exploration of finite-temperature dynamical properties. We suggest that MD simulations and phase-field modeling are valuable approaches to overcome these limitations.
Deep potential molecular dynamics
In classical MD simulations, atoms are treated as structureless classical particles that interact through a classical force field and obey Newton’s laws of motion. This approach efficiently simulates the time-dependent behavior of an ensemble of atoms. The accuracy of the force fields, which describe the interatomic interactions, is critical to the success of MD simulations. Historically, HfO
2
has been extensively studied for decades as a gate dielectric material and for its potential applications in resistive switching memory, long before its ferroelectric properties in thin films were discovered. During this period, several classical force fields of hafnia were developed
131
,
132
,
133
. These conventional force fields employ a set of analytical energy functions to model interatomic interactions, with parameters fitted to align the simulation results with known reference data. However, these force fields were developed without knowledge of the then-unknown ferroelectric
P
c
a
2
1
phase, which calls into question their effectiveness in studying the ferroelectric properties of
P
c
a
2

HfO
2
. Machine learning (ML) methods, known for their sophisticated handling of complex, high-dimensional data, provide promising avenues for developing force fields that are both transferable and scalable, with a precision comparable to DFT. Here, we focus on a specific machine-learning force field (MLFF), namely deep potential (DP), which employs deep learning techniques to train deep neural networks using first-principles data.
Wu et al. developed a DP model of HfO
2
using a concurrent learning procedure, which enabled accurate predictions of various structural properties such as elastic constants and equations of states for different hafnia polymorphs, phonon dispersion relationships, and phase transition barriers, achieving a level of accuracy comparable to DFT calculations
134

solid solutions across a range of
x
values, employing the strategy of “modular development of deep potential”
135
. Using this unified DP model, a series of constant-temperature constant-pressure (
N
P
T
) MD simulations were performed to study composition-dependent, temperature-driven phase transitions. Intriguingly, MD simulations uncovered two distinct phase transitions:

Phase-field simulations
Phase-field modeling is the most popular and powerful method for modeling ferroelectrics at the mesoscopic length scale. This approach, rooted in Ginzburg–Landau theory, represents the free energy continuously via the order parameter. These thermodynamic functions, typically polynomial expressions of independent variables, could be extended to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. The spatial distribution of the order parameter governs the inhomogeneous properties at the interface, and the free energy is calculated by summing all energy contributions associated with the order parameter. The evolution over time of the order parameter is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau equations
136
.
Noh et al. performed phase-field simulations on HZO, utilizing a Landau free energy expansion up to the 6th order terms with Landau coefficients calibrated to experimental data
137
. They observed that the DWs could spontaneously move even without an applied electric field, leading to spontaneous polarization excitation and relaxation processes critical for accumulative
P
-switching
138
. Zhou et al. explored the impact of 90° tail-to-tail DWs on the wake-up effects in polycrystalline HZO films (Fig.
11
b)
53
, using Landau coefficients derived from
P
-
\({\mathcal{E}}\)
hysteresis data
139
,
140
. Sugathan et al. used a genetic algorithm to optimize the effective Landau coefficients describing the free energy of HZO, reproducing experimental
P
-
\({\mathcal{E}}\)
curves for polycrystalline thin films
141
. Findings from phase-field simulations suggested that grain morphology and crystalline texture can be unitized to optimize the ferroelectric properties of HZO thin films.
Despite these efforts, two significant challenges persist in ensuring reliable phase-field simulations of hanifa-based thin films. Firstly, given the presence of multiple polymorphs, which result from different combinations of tetragonal, polar, and antipolar modes (see the section ‘Symmetry mode analysis of
P
c
a
2
1
’), the order parameters adopted in the Landau free energy fundamentally restrict the types of polymorphs that can be represented in phase-filed simulations. Recent progress includes the introduction of an order parameter to differentiate between the crystalline and amorphous phases
142
. However, additional order parameters are needed to describe competing nonpolar phases such as
M
and
T
. Another challenge in applying phase-field simulations to polycrystalline, multiphase hafnia-based ferroelectric thin films lies in establishing a uniform set of parameters, similar to those used for perovskite ferroelectric materials.
Summary and outlook
In this review, we have highlighted the computational efforts made in elucidating the ferroelectric mechanisms of HfO
2
, a prominent candidate for realizing the long-pursued goal of integrating ferroelectric functionality into integrated circuits to make ferroelectric memory commercially viable. We have examined various polar phases proposed to explain the ferroelectricity in hafnia-based thin films, assessing their stability, polarization characteristics, and experimental supporting evidence. The
P
c
a
2
1
phase appears to be the one most compatible with both DFT-based analyses and experimental findings, though ongoing debates are anticipated due to HfO
2
’s diverse polymorphs and their extrinsic factor-dependent stability.
We have seen extensive DFT-based investigations, exploring stabilizing factors essential for the formation of the metastable
P
c
a
2
1
phase. Although the surface energy model provides a plausible explanation for the inverse size effect, computing reliable surface energies for HfO
2
polymorphs remains a challenge and, consequently, a worthy direction for future research. While DFT modeling of the epitaxial strain effect has demonstrated remarkable success in the studies of epitaxial thin films of perovskite ferroelectrics, its significance in polycrystalline or epitaxial hafnia thin films, which often contain stress-relieving defects or undergo domain-matching epitaxy, is still up for debate.
The role of charged oxygen vacancies in structural polymorphism kinetics revealed by DFT calculations underscores the unique aspect of ferroelectric hafnia: the phase transition kinetics are at least as important as polarization switching kinetics given their similar energy barriers. These vacancies, like a double-edged sword, facilitate both nonpolar-to-polar and polar-to-nonpolar phase transitions. Recent experiments demonstrated that acceptor–donor co-doping, which regulates the level of oxygen vacancy, is a promising approach to improving the ferroelectric properties of HfO
2
143
.
There are many open questions, especially regarding the polarization-switching mechanisms involving domains and domain walls and their quantitative connections to macroscopic coercive fields. Traditional zero-Kelvin DFT-based nudged elastic band techniques, which require manual pathway construction, might introduce bias when determining the ferroelectric switching mechanisms. We suggest that large-scale MD simulations at finite temperatures and in the presence of electric fields, assisted by machine-learning force fields, could be a powerful tool to accurately determine the mechanisms at the atomic level without priori assumptions. Those computationally efficient force fields applicable to dopants and vacancies, if developed, could also facilitate a statistical analysis of the doping effect on the stability of hafnia polymorphs.
A significant gap exists between the prevalent interest in polycrystalline hafnia thin films used in device applications and the computational focus on single-crystal forms. Modeling polycrystalline films, which feature varied phases of HfO
2
and structural defects, is exceptionally challenging. A multiscale approach that combines DFT, MD, and phase-field modeling might not only be beneficial but necessary for achieving a correct mechanistic understanding of the ferroelectric behavior of HfO
2
under device-relevant conditions. Despite ongoing debates over the ferroelectric mechanisms in HfO
2
, one thing becomes evident: we are entering a new era of ferroelectric physics, thanks to this fluorite-structured, not-so-simple binary oxides. For computational physicists and materials scientists focused on ferroelectricity, it is exhilarating to be part of what remains a golden era, over a century since the discovery of the phenomenon.

Abstract
As machine learning (ML) continues to advance in the field of materials science, the variation in strategies for the same steps of the ML workflow becomes increasingly significant. These details can have a substantial impact on results, yet they have not received the deserved attention. This review aims to explore the various strategies available for each detail within the general workflow of materials ML. Firstly, the general workflow of materials ML will be introduced to help readers gain an understanding of potential details. Subsequently, different strategies of details within each step of the workflow will be presented through state-of-the-art case studies. The potential outcomes associated with choosing different strategies to details will be explored. Following this, suitable strategies for details will be recommended based on distinct application scenarios. Finally, directions for the future development of materials ML concerning details will be proposed. Through these discussions, we aspire to offer a comprehensive understanding of the nuances in details within materials ML. This will serve as valuable reference and guidance for researchers in both materials science and ML.

Introduction
Advanced materials serve as the cornerstone of a nation’s industrial prowess. To reduce the time and cost of materials development, the United States launched the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI)
1
in 2011, aiming at enhancing global competitiveness. Subsequently, the European Union, Japan, India, and China swiftly embarked on similar research programs. These research initiatives all underscore the drive to promote the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in advanced materials research and development
2
. Machine learning (ML), as a vital tool for realizing AI, is widely applied in materials design. The ‘data-driven scientific paradigm’ is referred to as the fourth paradigm of scientific development. ML, developed upon data, has the capacity to extract valuable insights from existing data, including even unsuccessful experimental samples
3
. It establishes implicit mapping relationships between features and target variables, allowing the guidance of material design through predictive models to predict the properties of unknown samples
4
. Over the past decades, ML has assisted researchers in achieving significant breakthroughs in various material design domains, including alloy materials
5
,
6
, photovoltaic materials
7
, perovskites
8
, superconductors
9
, etc. Compared to traditional empirical and computational methods, ML offers the advantage of rapidly and accurately constructing predictive models based on existing data, even in cases where the underlying physical mechanisms are not well-understood, thus guiding material development
10
. When there is a certain level of theoretical understanding, the incorporation of features combined with domain knowledge can further enhance the precision of model predictions
4
. Furthermore, ML can uncover potential patterns within extensive datasets, promoting the refinement of domain knowledge. For instance, Priyanga et al.
11
utilized features including elemental composition, ionic radii, electron properties, and electronegativity to construct a random forest (RF) model for classifying the direct and indirect band gaps of perovskite oxides. Through the feature importance estimation method embedded in the RF model, the average ionic character was identified as the most crucial determinant. Correlation analysis further revealed that higher values of the average ionic character were conducive to obtaining a direct band gap.
The general workflow of ML comprises four steps: dataset construction, feature selection, model evaluation and selection, and model application. In each step, various details need to be taken into consideration. For instance, in the context of dataset construction, considerations include how to obtain features, handling missing values, the necessity of data transformation, the treatment of duplicate samples with the same features but different target values, and the approach to handling outliers. Furthermore, decisions must be made regarding the strategy and ratio for partitioning the dataset into training and test sets. When it comes to feature selection, there are considerations such as whether to perform feature selection for each model; how to choose an appropriate feature selection method from the various available options; and how to strike a balance between model accuracy, complexity, and interpretability during feature selection. Regarding model evaluation and selection, some of the details include what criteria to use for model selection; whether only one model can be chosen as the optimal model; and how to assess the generalization ability, extrapolation capability, and stability of the model. The application of models can be divided into two main aspects: one involves designing candidates that meet specific performance objectives, and the other entails exploring relevant physical and chemical principles via feature interpretation methods and statistical techniques. When designing candidates with single-target property, the strategies could involve generating a lot of virtual samples and filtering them through predictive models, or it could incorporate optimization algorithms or other reverse design methods to identify candidates. For candidates aiming to satisfy multiple performance objectives, potential strategies include ε-constrained method, converting the multi-objective problem into a single-objective one using weighted methods, or employing multi-objective optimization algorithms. In the pursuit of uncovering physical and chemical principles, researchers may utilize various methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
12
, partial dependence plots (PDP)
13
, sensitivity analysis (SA) techniques, or employ visualization-based statistical methods. These unresolved questions provoke profound contemplation in the field.
As illustrated above, there are numerous details to consider at each step of materials ML. These details are not merely binary choices of yes or no; many of them offer a plethora of available strategies. The varied strategies employed can yield distinct effects, making it a subject worthy of exploration. This review aims to integrate cutting-edge research findings, summarize the various strategies for details, and analyze the potential differences in results. The discussion can assist readers in selecting the most suitable strategies for their specific materials science problems when using ML methods. Additionally, future directions for the details in materials ML are also proposed.
The workflow of materials machine learning
The general workflow of ML-assisted materials design, as depicted in Fig.
1
, begins with the collection of data, including values of target properties and relevant features such as materials composition, process parameters, and features generated from the composition or structure. Subsequently, the data undergoes preprocessing.
Fig. 1: The workflow of machine learning in materials science.
The four main steps of materials machine learning.

Following data preprocessing, feature selection is performed to establish a predictive model for the target variable using the optimal subset of features obtained. The primary function of this predictive model is to predict unknown samples, thus designing candidates meeting the desired performance criteria. Another aspect of model application involves analyzing the mechanism of the constructed model. Employing interpretable ML methods and statistical techniques, researchers can dissect how certain crucial features influence the target variable, thereby advancing the development of pertinent theories.
Dataset construction
The dataset forms the foundation of ML modeling, encompassing a comprehensive set of features along with their corresponding target variable values. The quality of the dataset dictates the upper limits of ML. Foundational data such as target variables and material compositions can be sourced from relevant literature and databases. It is worth noting that experimental data holds more persuasive power compared to computational data because it is obtained through actual observations and measurements of real-world phenomena
14
. On the other hand, computational data is generated through mathematical models and simulations, which may not always accurately reflect the complexities of the real world. Therefore, experimental data is often used as a benchmark to validate the accuracy of theoretical models or simulations
15
,
16
. However, the value of experimental data also depends on the quality of the experiments, the accuracy of measurements, and other factors. In some cases, computational data from the well-designed and validated computational models can provide valuable insights when experimental data is limited or challenging to obtain
17
,

.
Features are also referred to as descriptors. Apart from the elemental composition of materials and process parameters during production, for inorganic materials, Ward et al.
20
have developed a series of universal descriptors. These descriptors are based on elemental basic properties, and mathematical operators (such as maximum value, minimum value, average, and standard deviation, among others) are used to construct descriptors from the physical properties of elements. These descriptors can be obtained through Python packages such as the Mendeleev Python package
21
and the Matminer Python package
22
. For organic materials, which are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, their molecular structures are often more complex compared to inorganic materials. This complexity arises from the presence of carbon-carbon bonds and various functional groups, making their structures more intricate and diverse. Relying solely on features based on elemental properties may not be sufficient to construct an accurate mapping relationship between features and target variables for organic materials. In such cases, molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints can be employed as additional features. These can be obtained through software tools such as CDK
23
, Pybel
24
, RDKit
25
, and PaDEL
26
. In addition, there are features constructed by incorporating domain knowledge, such as features for the phase parameters or mechanical performance of HEAs
4
, and features associated with perovskite stability: tolerance factor (
t
)
27
, improved tolerance factor (
τ
)
28
, and octahedral factor (
O
f
)
27
.
After obtaining these fundamental features, more complex features can be reconstructed from them. For example, the sure independence screening sparsifying operator (SISSO)
29
,
30
method can be employed to generate such features. SISSO is a feature engineering technique based on compressive sensing. It combines simple descriptors using mathematical operators to create a multitude of more intricate features, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model is utilized to identify the optimal low-dimensional feature subset.
The raw dataset often presents several issues, including variations in the values of target variables for the same composition and experimental conditions across different literature sources, as well as missing values and outliers. Consequently, it may not be directly suitable for ML modeling. Therefore, data preprocessing is necessary, which commonly involves handling missing values, addressing outliers, and performing data transformations, such as taking logarithms and data standardization, etc. After data preprocessing, selecting an appropriate partitioning method to divide the dataset into training and test sets becomes essential. The strategy for dividing the dataset can impact the model’s performance and the evaluation of its predictive ability.
Feature selection
The candidate feature pool may contain a wealth of information, but not every feature is necessarily correlated with the target variable. Modeling with all features may not guarantee the highest model accuracy, and it can significantly increase model complexity, thereby elevating the risk of overfitting
31
. Before determining the feature selection method, it is necessary to define the objective function during the feature selection process, which serves as a metric for assessing the quality of a feature subset. Typically, model accuracy is chosen as the objective function for feature selection. However, considerations can also include model complexity and interpretability. By placing emphasis on different aspects, the optimal feature subset may vary accordingly.
Common feature selection methods can be categorized into filter, wrapper, and embedded approaches
32
,
33
. Filter methods are model-agnostic and include techniques such as variance threshold filtering, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) method, maximum information coefficient (MIC) method, and the maximum relative minimum redundancy (mRMR)
34
,
35
,
36
. Wrapper methods customize feature subsets for specific algorithms by evaluating their performance. Common wrapper methods include sequential forward/backward selection (SFS/SBS)
37
, recursive feature addition/elimination (RFA/RFE)
38
, and genetic algorithm (GA)
39
,
40
method. Embedded methods incorporate feature selection into the model training process and are often utilized with tree models and models with regularization terms, such as LASSO and ridge regression (RR). The detailed descriptions of these feature selection methods can be found in the Lu et al.’s
41
review. It is worth noting that there are numerous feature selection methods available, and researchers are not limited to choosing only one. In practice, a combination of multiple feature selection methods is often employed to determine the optimal feature subset.
Model evaluation and selection
The results of model evaluation typically serve as the basis for model selection, where different evaluation methods may identify different optimal models. Aspects to be evaluated include model fitting ability, generalization capability, stability, and extrapolation ability. Commonly used evaluation methods include independent test sets, k-fold cross-validation (CV), leave-out-group (LOG) CV, etc. Utilizing various evaluation methods simultaneously can elucidate both the strengths and limitations of the model across different aspects. However, due to computational resource constraints, some evaluation methods may be used exclusively to assess the optimal model selected by a single evaluation method.
At present, there is no universally applicable ML algorithm suitable for all scientific problems
42
. Hence, selecting the most suitable algorithm based on the specific problem is of paramount importance
37
. Commonly used ML algorithms mainly include linear algorithms, decision tree-based algorithms, artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and Bayesian-based algorithms, et al.
43
. Linear algorithms are relatively simple and offer strong interpretability but may sacrifice some model accuracy. Decision tree-based algorithms, such as random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
44
, exhibit good fitting performance for many nonlinear problems, but their poor extrapolation capability has been criticized. Artificial neural networks theoretically can fit various functional relationships but require a substantial amount of training data, making them a cautious choice for small datasets
45
. SVM often perform well on small datasets and are known for their kernel functions against linear or nonlinear data distribution. Bayesian-based algorithms, such as Gaussian process regression (GPR), describe problems probabilistically and can provide prediction intervals to address uncertainty quantification
46
. Based on the characteristics of the dataset and the modeling objectives, the most suitable algorithm can be selected after comparing several algorithms. Algorithm selection criteria can be based on results from CV or independent test sets. It is worth noting that when multiple models perform similarly well and are closely matched, ensemble methods can be employed to obtain an optimal model. After model selection, it is usually necessary to optimize the internal hyperparameters of the model to further enhance its performance.
Model application
The application of the model involves two main aspects: one is to predict unknown samples to design materials with desired performance, the other is the exploration of physical and chemical principles through model analysis.
Candidates with optimal performance can be obtained through forward prediction and inverse design. The forward prediction means predicting the target variable by inputting features into the model available. In contrast, inverse design starts from desired properties as ‘input’ and ends in chemical space as ‘output’
47
. Typical forward prediction methods include high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), where candidates with desirable performance are selected from a large pool of virtual samples based on predictions. In inverse design, the problem is often transformed into an optimization problem, which is solved using optimization algorithms. In the field of engineering applications, the design of candidates satisfying multiple objectives is receiving growing attention
48
. Solutions to such problems typically come in three forms. The first approach involves converting multiple objectives into a single objective through multi-objective weighting, which is then addressed using single-objective design methods. The second method is ε-constrained method, where candidates within the range of secondary objective variables are selected to form a subset, and then the optimal candidate are chosen from this subset based on the primary objective variable. The third approach employs multi-objective optimization algorithms to obtain candidates, typically seeking optimality in Pareto sense. The solutions obtained are not single points but rather a set, allowing decision-makers to choose based on different application scenarios.
Model analysis enhances the interpretability of the model’s predictions by uncovering the influence mechanisms between critical features and the target variable. This process facilitates the advancement of domain knowledge and guides materials design. Since model analysis is based on a well-established ML model, it is a crucial component of model application. Statistical methods employed in model analysis include feature importance ranking methods, SHAP, SA, and PDP et al.
Details
In this section, more comprehensive discussions of the details within each step of ML for materials design will be processed. The insights obtained from various strategies of detail can assist researchers in selecting the most suitable strategies for their own studies.
Details in dataset construction
Source of data
Different candidate feature pools can ultimately impact the upper limit of the accuracy of the model. Lian et al.
49
devised domain knowledge features based on empirical formulas for ML modeling to predict the fatigue life of seven different series of aluminum alloys. The results revealed that the designed features exhibited the highest PCC with the target variable. Additionally, the inclusion of these designed features significantly improved the accuracy of the model. Wen et al.
4
used the experimental samples to construct ML model for predicting the hardness of HEAs. Their results showed that better model was obtained by using compositional features combined with domain knowledge descriptors rather than using composition alone as features. Chen et al.
50
, in order to predict the Charpy impact toughness of low-alloy steels, proposed three feature construction strategies: the first adopting alloy composition solely, the second incorporating both alloy composition and heat treatment parameters, and the third considering alloy composition, heat treatment parameters, and physical features. As the feature pool expanded, the accuracy of the model significantly improved. The PCC between predicted values and actual values increased from 0.79 to a remarkable 0.96. Zhao et al.
51
examined the impact of different descriptors on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for donor/acceptor pairs. The results revealed that ML predictions were more accurate when both structural and physical descriptors were used concurrently, as opposed to using either one exclusively.
Highlights
When the physical mechanisms of the target variable are not fully understood, it is advisable to enrich the information in the candidate feature pool as much as possible. In addition to basic features such as composition and process parameters, incorporating domain knowledge-based features derived from empirical and physical formulas, structural features, and other types of features can enhance the accuracy of the model.
Missing values
In practice, datasets often contain missing values, and training models on such datasets can significantly impact prediction quality. The simplest approach is to remove the missing values directly, which is suitable for large datasets with a small proportion of missing values (<5%)
52
. In materials science, each experimental data point is valuable. When datasets are limited and contain missing values, to address data scarcity and avoid bias from direct deletion, imputation methods can be employed. Replacing missing values with the mean or median of the non-missing values is an easy-to-implement method suitable for small numerical datasets. However, this approach does not consider feature correlations or imputation uncertainty
53
. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation method uses feature similarity to predict missing values by taking the weighted average of the corresponding feature values from the k most similar samples in the training set. Its drawback is sensitivity to outliers. The multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) method uses a series of estimates obtained through an iterative process to perform multiple imputations. Initially, all missing values are imputed with the mean. The variable with the fewest missing values is selected as the dependent variable, and the dataset is split into training and test sets based on the presence of missing values in this variable. A regression model is then used with other variables as predictors to estimate the missing values of the dependent variable, replacing the initial mean imputations. This process is repeated for the next variable with the fewest missing values. Lyngdoh et al.
54
aimed to establish the link between concrete composition and strength. They compared mean and median imputation, KNN imputation (k = 5 and k = 10), and MICE imputation methods. XGBoost demonstrated the best predictive performance when missing data were imputed using KNN with k = 10. Deng et al.
55
proposed a method for missing data imputation based on a clustering-based collaborative filtering (ClubCF) algorithm to address missing values in squeeze casting process parameters. ClubCF, which utilizes K-means clustering, outperformed mean imputation and regression imputation methods on their dataset. Additionally, there are imputation methods based on principal component analysis
56
,
57
,
58
and neural networks
59
.
Highlights
Directly deleting data with missing values can bias the dataset and reduce its representativeness of the real-world data distribution. To avoid this and maximize data utilization, various imputation methods have been developed, including mean and median imputation, MICE, KNN-based imputation, and PCA-based imputation. In the materials field, imputation methods are still rarely used. Different datasets have varying missing data mechanisms and coupling characteristics, making no single method universally applicable. Therefore, the application of imputation methods in materials science deserves further research.
Transformation of data
Normalization is a data preprocessing technique to scale or transform data into a standardized range, typically within the range of 0 to 1 or −1 to 1. Common normalization methods include Z-score normalization and Min-Max scaling, and its primary objective is to eliminate scale differences among different variables. Wu et al.
60
found that the performance of SVR and kernel ridge regression (KRR) models was highly sensitive to feature normalization (Z-score standardization). After normalization, SVR and KRR models exhibited significant improvement in performance, with coefficient of determination (
R
2
)
values increasing from 0.826 to 0.936 and from 0.819 to 0.932, respectively. However, normalization had only a slight impact on the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model, with
R

changing from 0.943 to 0.936. For SVR and KRR algorithms, the hyperparameters of the kernel function are heavily influenced by unnormalized features. Some truly important features may receive smaller hyperparameters without normalization, leading to significant errors in ML models and ultimately providing unreliable prediction results
60
. However, unlike SVR and KRR algorithms, the GBR algorithm relies on regression trees, where the decision process of tree models does not involve distance metrics. Instead, it partitions data features continuously for classification or regression based on feature thresholds. Consequently, the scale of the data is typically not a critical factor for tree models.
Large fluctuations in the distribution of the target variable or the presence of outliers can lead to instability in the predictions of the model. To mitigate this effect, one approach is to take the logarithm of the target variable. In a study by Hu et al.
61
, to address the issue of uneven data distribution, a natural logarithm transformation was applied to the target variable. As shown in Fig.
2
, this transformation resulted in a more uniform distribution of the target variable, approaching a normal distribution. This transformation can enhance the performance of models like linear regression and Bayesian models, as they often assume the normality of data distribution. However, it should be noted that taking the logarithm is only suitable for target variables with strictly positive values and is not applicable to cases that include zeros or negative numbers. Moreover, when using the logarithmic transformation, the error of the model is scaled. Therefore, to accurately assess the model’s performance and facilitate comparisons with similar models, inverse transformation of predicted results should be applied when calculating evaluation metrics.

Highlights
When using ML models that involve distance metrics, such as SVM, KRR, and KNN, normalization for features should be performed. However, for tree models, feature normalization may be optional. To make the distribution of variable values more uniform and conform to a normal distribution, a logarithmic transformation can be applied, but the conditions for its use must be noted. Additionally, for ease of comparison and analysis, the data should be back-transformed when calculating errors or conducting analyses.
Duplicate samples
Here, duplicate samples refer to samples with identical features but different experimental values for the target variable collected in different studies. The generation of duplicate samples can be attributed to two main factors. Firstly, it may stem from incomplete data collection, such as the oversight of varying experimental conditions and process parameters. When these parameters are used as features, some experimental samples may not be considered duplicates. Secondly, experimental errors are inevitable. Apart from measurement errors, unrecorded factors overlooked by experimenters can also lead to variations in experimental results. This can reduce the reproducibility of experiments and potentially conceal important patterns within the data. Therefore, it is encouraged that experimenters maintain comprehensive records during experiments to mitigate these issues. Similarly, researchers should exercise caution when dealing with duplicate samples during the ML process. Zhao et al.
51
took the average of duplicate samples and removed other duplicate samples from the database. Yang et al.
5
and Wen et al.
4
discarded duplicate samples with significant differences in experimental values, while retaining them with averaging if the differences were not significant. Chen et al.
62
removed extreme values from duplicate samples and used the average of the remaining duplicate sample experimental values as the target value. Meanwhile, Xu et al.
63
included duplicate samples in the test set, trained the model using other samples, and then predicted the target values of the duplicate samples with the trained model. The experimental value closest to the predicted value was selected as the ‘true value’. These duplicate samples were considered the result of experimental errors, and high-performing ML models have the ability to correct inappropriate experimental values for duplicate samples. Some researchers do not process duplicate values and treat them as distinct samples.
Highlights
Using duplicate samples with a relatively large relative error directly to train the model can increase the error of the model. The same ML model will inevitably yield the same output for the same input values. If these duplicate samples are included in the training set, the model may predict an intermediate value among multiple target values for duplicate samples during training to reduce the fitting error. However, for duplicate samples with relatively large relative errors, this could be due to significant experimental errors for some duplicate samples, leading to a larger deviation of the predicted intermediate value from the true value, affecting the fitting performance of the model. Therefore, directly including all duplicate samples in the training set is not appropriate. Instead, duplicate samples with negligible relative errors can be preserved by computing the average of their values. The threshold for relative error can be determined based on acceptable measurement inaccuracies. Duplicate samples with large relative errors can either be discarded or included in the test set, where a trained ML model can be used to correct their experimental values.
Poorly performing samples (negative samples)
Zhang et al.
64
employed ML methods to balance the saturation magnetization (
B
s
), glass-forming ability (measured by the critical casting size,
D
max
), and ductility of iron-based metallic glasses (MG). During data preprocessing, samples with Fe content less than 0.3 were removed because of their low
B
s
. Additionally, samples with
D
max
< 1 mm were discarded due to their poor glass-forming ability. Therefore, poorly performing samples were removed effectively from the dataset. Consequently, the
D
max
might be overestimated since the training set lacks samples that cannot transform into MG. Conversely, Wu et al.
60
took a reverse approach when searching for HOIPs with bandgaps ranging from 0.9 to 1.6 eV. Negative samples were included in the training set, comprising 132 metal candidates (with a bandgap of 0) that had been incorrectly filtered out by a prior ML model
65
. This strategy resulted in more reliable candidate selections, and subsequent DFT validation revealed only one incorrectly filtered metal candidate, greatly improving the accuracy.
Highlights
These cases illustrate the importance of including both negative and positive samples in the dataset. Poorly performing samples, also referred to as failed samples, may contain distinct information from successful ones, thereby complementing each other to enhance the overall performance of the ML model. However, the challenge lies in the limited reporting of failed samples. It encourages researchers to report failed samples, thus further promoting data-driven research in related fields.
Outliers
The approaches of dealing with outliers that deviate significantly from the mean level will be discussed. When Zhang et al.
66
modeled the hardness of HEAs, they compared the models with and without outliers and found a minor but statistically insignificant improvement in
R
2
and root mean square error (RMSE) after removing the outliers. The authors believed that since their dataset originated from the real world and scientific measurements, the probability of outliers being caused by measurement errors was low. In the real world, the presence of outliers is objective, and one must consider scenarios involving outliers to establish a connection between the model and the real world. Removing outliers can result in better fitting for the corresponding samples, but if an unknown sample happens to resemble a previously removed outlier when making predictions, the prediction bias may dramatically increase at that point.
Highlights
The presence of outliers in the real world is objective, and samples corresponding to outliers may contain crucial information, especially regarding groundbreaking insights into target properties. In the case of interpolation predictions, the removal of outliers can be considered if it significantly enhances the performance of the model. However, if the model is intended for groundbreaking predictions, outliers should not be removed.
Dataset splitting methods
The most commonly used data splitting method is random partitioning, where the training set percentage is generally set at 75%, 80%, or 90%. Mannodi-Kanakkithodi et al.
67
collected 284 polymer data points to predict their dielectric performance using ML methods. The optimal training set size was investigated by progressively splitting the dataset from 50 (approximately 20% of the dataset) to 250 (approximately 90%), with the remaining data utilized as the test set. This process was repeated 50 times for each proportion, and the average and standard deviation of prediction errors for both the training and test sets were computed. The results showed a general trend of decreasing average test sets error with increasing training set size. However, it was also observed that for larger training set sizes, in many cases, while the average error for the training set was smaller, the standard deviation for the test sets appeared to be higher. This was attributed to some unreasonable data partitioning in 50 random splits, resulting in significant distribution differences between the training and test sets. Therefore, when using a single random split, careful selection of the training and test set distributions is necessary; otherwise, the model evaluation results from random splitting may be subject to randomness. To obtain more robust models and evaluation results, multiple random splits can be employed, and their averages can represent the predictive performance of the model. However, there is no consensus on the exact number of repetitions required. In order to reasonably partition the collected 437 samples into training and test sets, Lu et al.
68
optimized two parameters, namely the random seed (representing the sample distribution) and the partition ratio. The optimal training and test sets ratio was determined to be 81.95% and 18.05%, respectively, along with the optimal parameter for the random seed, which was set to 1959.
In addition to random splitting, Liang et al.
69
applied a stratified splitting method in their study on the thermodynamic stability classification of halide double perovskites. This approach ensures that the proportions of samples in each category are roughly balanced between the training and test sets, alleviating the issue of class imbalance
70
. While stratified splitting is commonly used in classification problems, it can also be employed in regression tasks when the distribution of the target variable varies unevenly across different ranges
71
. Barnard et al.
72
constructed regression models to predict the stability of diamond nanoparticles, the ionization potential, and the electronic band gap. Due to the imbalanced distribution of the target variables, stratified splitting was used to split the dataset. Stratified splitting is a data splitting strategy based on the perspective of the target variable, and alternatively, datasets can also be partitioned based on the features. Xu et al.
73
used the sphere exclusion algorithm
74
to partition the dataset sensibly. This algorithm aims to diversify the chemical substances in the training set structurally, covering the entire descriptor space of the dataset while keeping the samples in the training and test sets close.
Highlights
A reasonable partitioning should aim to make the distributions of the training and test sets as similar as possible to that of the entire dataset, ensuring that the model receives adequate training on the training set and that the performance evaluation on the test set is meaningful
75
. If there is a substantial disparity between the distributions of the training set and the dataset, the model may not be exposed to enough information during training, potentially resulting in lower-than-expected performance in practical applications. Similarly, if there is a significant difference in distribution between the test set and the dataset, the performance evaluation on the test set may not be sufficiently objective and effective. For datasets with relatively uniform distributions, random partitioning can be employed, while for datasets with imbalanced sample distributions, more effective partitioning methods such as stratified splitting or the sphere exclusion algorithm should be considered. Additionally, the consistency of the distributions between the dataset and the training set and test set can be assessed through visualization or other comparative analytical methods.
Details in feature selection
The sequence of model selection and feature selection
Wrapper methods are commonly employed in feature selection, requiring a careful choice of the ML model to be integrated. This raises the question of whether to first select the optimal model and perform wrapper methods exclusively on the optimal model or to apply wrapper methods to all models. Wen et al.
76
attempted all combinations of 8 features separately for all six models. Chen et al.
62
conducted feature selection for RR, XGBoost, and SVR models separately. Meanwhile, Yang et al.
5
initially used the composition of HEAs as features and established hardness prediction models based on several widely used ML algorithms, including multiple linear regression (MLR), backpropagation neural network, GBR, RF, XGBoost, and SVM. The optimal model was identified, and feature selection was subsequently performed based solely on the optimal model.
Highlights
Performing feature selection for each algorithm can improve the accuracy of each model. The best algorithm may differ before and after feature selection. Subsequently, model selection is carried out, which aligns more with the conventions of ML but comes with significantly increased computational complexity. Conversely, selecting the optimal algorithm first and then performing feature selection often involves using the same algorithm before and after feature selection. This strategy offers efficiency, particularly with high-dimensional features, saving substantial computational resources. However, the drawback is that it may not lead to each model exhibiting its optimal performance. Researchers can make a comprehensive consideration, taking computational costs and model accuracy into account, to choose which strategy to adopt.
Selection of feature selection methods
Feature selection methods are generally categorized into three types: filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods. However, in many research studies, these three methods are not exclusively used; instead, they are often combined. Jiang et al.
77
employed ML methods to select compounds with the desired wavelength and excellent stability for garnet structure. To obtain the optimal feature subset for wavelength prediction, 19 features with zero variance were first removed. Subsequently, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on the remaining 66 features. The feature pairs with PCC exceeding 0.9 were identified, and among them, those with lower correlations with wavelength were removed. Then, SFS was employed with different models to reduce the 47-dimensional feature space to a 10-dimensional feature subspace. During this process, instances were observed where the
R
2
and mean absolute error (MAE) in 10-fold CV remained unchanged or even deteriorated as the number of features increased from 1 to 10, as shown in Fig.
3a
. It is attributed to the greedy nature of the SFS algorithm, leading to the inclusion of redundant features. Consequently, features that did not significantly impact model performance were removed, and ultimately, 7 features were selected.

.
Full size image
Due to the drawbacks of the SFS method, Yang et al.
5
introduced an additional step in their four-step feature selection process. Instead of directly using the 10 feature combinations with the lowest errors obtained in the third step of SFS, the ‘best-subset selection’
78
was added as the fourth step. In this step, the optimal combination was selected from all possible subsets of the 10 features, as illustrated in Fig.
3b
, resulting in the final choice of 5 features. In addition to SFS, Li et al.
79
employed SBS, while Zhang et al.
80
utilized RFA based on feature importance ranking. The disadvantage of these algorithms is that once a feature is added (or removed), it cannot be further adjusted, and the resulting feature subset may not necessarily be globally optimal
81
. Xu et al.
63
employed GA as their feature selection method, which is one of the most efficient feature selection methods. GA, inspired by the principles of biological evolution, iterate and update individuals within a population to find the global optimum without exhaustively testing all feature combinations
82
. Multiple wrapper methods can also be combined. Zhang et al.
66
used a combination of RF-based feature selection, GA, and RFE methods to select features, retaining those features selected by at least three of these methods.
In addition to the application of wrapper methods, embedded methods are frequently used. Embedded methods integrate feature selection with model training, offering higher efficiency compared to wrapper methods. Lyu et al.
83
employed a logistic regression (LR) model with an L1 penalty, removing unimportant features with coefficient values of 0. Similarly, Ghiringhelli et al.
84
utilized the LASSO to select the best feature subset from a pool of 10,000 material descriptors for predicting the crystal structures of semiconductors. However, the models used in embedded methods are typically linear models with L1 regularization, which may not perform well in capturing complex mapping relationships.
Highlights
When dealing with a lot of features, stepwise feature selection methods are more preferable. Begin with a filter method, such as removing features with zero variance or highly linearly correlated redundant features. Following this, employ wrapper methods. There are several feature selection algorithms available within the wrapper methods framework, and the most suitable one can be chosen through comparative analysis. Additionally, the best feature subset can also be a combination of multiple wrapper methods. Finally, when dealing with a reduced number of features, the ‘best-subset selection’ can be used. In cases where a linear model can be used to fit the mapping relationship between features and target variables effectively, consider using a linear regression model with an L1 regularization term as an embedded method to simultaneously handle feature selection and model training.
Emphasis in feature selection: model accuracy vs. model complexity vs. model interpretability
Feature selection is guided by three distinct objectives: model accuracy, model complexity, and model interpretability. Different objectives lead to variations in the optimal feature subset. Most commonly, the primary goal of feature selection is to enhance model accuracy. Wu et al.
60
selected the top 16 most important features out of 32 based on the feature importance obtained from the GBR model and used them for modeling. The results showed that the reduced feature set performed slightly worse than using the complete feature set, indicating that the remaining non-important features also contribute to improving the performance of the ML model. Therefore, the complete feature set was reintroduced in subsequent computations. This case study prioritized model accuracy, but it is essential to note that the dataset was relatively large, comprising 906 samples with 90% of the data used for training, which mitigated the risk of overfitting given the number of features.
Typically, many researchers simultaneously consider both model accuracy and model complexity. Yang et al.
5
adhering to the ‘Occam’s Razor’ principle, struck a balance between model simplicity and accuracy by employing the minimum number of features necessary for a sufficiently accurate model. An R-value of 0.94 for the test set predictions was achieved using only five features in the modeling process. Similarly, Zhang et al.
66
explored all possible combinations of seven features. It was observed that increasing the number of features beyond five did not significantly improve the accuracy of the model but substantially increased model complexity. Consequently, a set of five features was opted. In addition to manually observing changes in model evaluation metrics corresponding to different feature subsets for the selection of the optimal feature subset, Chen et al.
62
employed the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) that considers both fitting performance and model complexity as the selection criterion. The feature subset with the lowest AIC was opted.
Increasing the interpretability of the model is also crucial. Selecting features that incorporate domain knowledge and giving their physical and chemical significance, can reduce the risk of model overfitting. Lu et al.
68
employed ML to predict the experimental bandgaps of HOIPs. From the features generated by the Villars and Mendeleev Python package, only simple descriptors with clear meanings were selected, while another 66 descriptors containing more complex or meaningless information were discarded, with the aim of achieving a model that is as interpretable as possible. Zhao et al.
51
argued that using solely chemical fingerprint descriptors can lead to strong fitting capabilities of ML models but may hinder the discovery of molecules with entirely different chemical characteristics. Therefore, retaining well-performing descriptors with chemical and physical significance is essential not only for enhancing model interpretability but also for maintaining accurate predictions when the model encounters entirely different chemical compounds. It is important to note that increasing model interpretability and improving model accuracy are not necessarily contradictory goals. Integrating domain knowledge into ML often leads to better performance compared to purely data-driven approaches
85
. Furthermore, it can enhance the reliability and robustness of ML models.
Highlights
Three aspects need to be considered when constructing a model: accuracy, complexity, and interpretability. Accuracy is a fundamental requirement, and model complexity and interpretability can be further considered based on an acceptable accuracy. The accuracy and complexity of a model are often considered simultaneously, aiming to achieve as high accuracy with as few features as possible. This becomes particularly critical when handling limited data, as an excessive number of features increases the risk of overfitting. Selecting features based on domain knowledge is advantageous as they possess chemical and physical significance, guiding the model. This not only enhances the interpretability and generalization capability of the model but also improves its accuracy.
Details in model evaluation and selection
Details of model evaluation methods
Model evaluation and model selection are not separate processes. Model selection relies on the results of model evaluation, and after model selection, the optimal model can undergo more comprehensive evaluation. However, if sufficient time and computational resources are available, evaluating each candidate model comprehensively before model selection may lead to selecting a model with superior overall performance.
In most of the ML works, the train–test splitting scores or CV results are usually used as the basis for model evaluation
86
. The train-test splitting scores depend largely on the allocation of data points to the training and test sets, and the evaluation results can vary significantly based on this allocation. To avoid the randomness of train-test splitting scores, it is advisable to repeat the dataset splitting process multiple times and use the average results from the test sets as the basis for model selection
60
,
76
. Repeated train-test splitting ensures extensive coverage of the target variable within the test sets, thus effectively assessing the performance of the model. Similarly, the test sets generated by k-fold CV techniques can uniformly cover the entire range of the target variable. In the k-fold CV, the dataset is initially randomly divided into k equally-sized, mutually exclusive subsets. Each time, (k - 1) of these subsets are combined to form the training set, and the remaining subset is used as the test set. This process results in k sets of training/test data, where training and test are performed iteratively, and the final evaluation is based on the average of the k test results. In k-fold CV, data resampling is conducted without replacement, ensuring that each data point appears once in the test sets. This evenly covers the entire range of target variables, effectively testing the performance of ML algorithms. Typical choices for the value of k are 5 or 10
87
. For larger datasets, smaller values of k are typically sufficient, whereas for smaller datasets, larger values of k are needed
88
. Additionally, when k is equal to the size of the sample set, it represents a special case of k-fold CV known as leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). LOOCV provides nearly unbiased estimates of accuracy
89
, but it incurs a high computational cost. Therefore, it is often employed for evaluating model performance on small datasets.
Although k-fold cross-validation is widely used for model evaluation, the assessment of ML model predictive performance using an independent test set should not be overlooked. Furthermore, as more samples may be reported over time, these data can serve as an extended test set to further validate the predictive capabilities of the model
83
. Many researchers employ multiple evaluation methods. Yang et al.
5
and Zhang et al.
66
used independent test set, 10-fold CV, and LOOCV to assess model performance. Mai et al.
90
assessed the predictive capabilities of models using independent test set, extended test set, 5-fold CV, 10-fold CV, and LOOCV. The average results from repeated CV are commonly used to evaluate the stability of the model
5
,
14
,
90
, but there is no consensus on the number of repetitions required to obtain reliable results.
A challenge in materials science is the discovery of materials with higher or lower physical/chemical properties among all known materials
91
. Currently, the performance of ML algorithms used for materials property prediction is often evaluated through k-fold CV or train-test splitting, which tends to overestimate their exploratory predictive performance in discovering unknown materials. Xiong et al.
91
proposed the k-fold-m-step forward cross-validation (kmFCV) method to assess the extrapolation capability of materials property prediction models. Unlike traditional k-fold CV methods that randomly partition data into k subsets, kmFCV first sorts all samples based on material property values and then evenly divides them into k subsets. As shown in Fig.
4
, in each iteration, the subset with the lowest property values is used as the training set, and the next subset is used as the validation set, continuously advancing until the subset with the highest property values serves as the validation set. The average of validation set metrics is used as the final evaluation result. The evaluation results revealed that tree models and KNN exhibited poor extrapolation capabilities.

91
.
The k-fold forward CV partitions the dataset based on the order of target values, with the fold containing the highest target values used as the test set, progressively moving forward.
Full size image
kmFCV partitions the dataset based on the target property values to evaluate the model’s ability to explore materials with groundbreaking performance. Furthermore, as another scenario of extrapolation, we may be interested in designing materials with structures, compositions, or other features that are radically different from those reflected in the training data, i.e., exploring unknown chemical spaces. Random CV often overestimates the model’s ability to predict unknown chemical spaces because during random partitioning, the training and test sets may typically have similar constituent elements, with only slight variations in composition. This allows the model to effectively act as a ‘look-up’ table to predict nearby materials rather than learning deeper physical principles
92
. Leave-out-group (LOG) CV can be used to assess the machine learning model’s ability of exploring unknown chemical spaces. It partitions the dataset into different groups based on features for CV, with the test data comprising an entire distinct group of data.
Groups can be determined based on the results of clustering algorithms or manually defined criteria, such as grouping data with similar chemical compositions. LOG CV imposes higher requirements than k-fold CV, aiming to simulate the model’s performance when presented with test data significantly different from the training data. Jacobs et al.
93
grouped the data from different databases and found that the model’s RMSE in LOG CV was significantly higher than that in 5-fold CV. Wu et al.
94
and Afflerbach et al.
92
grouped the data based on chemical composition and used LOG CV to assess the model’s predictive ability for target properties in unknown chemical spaces. Furthermore, Afflerbach et al.
92
indicate that when the number of samples with similar compositions reaches a critical threshold in the training set, the model’s performance improves to some extent, resulting in more stable predictions. However, the average error does not exhibit a significant, sustained decrease. Meredig et al.
95
partitioned the dataset into clusters using the k-means clustering method and trained machine learning models on the remaining clusters to predict each test cluster, demonstrating the effectiveness of LOG CV in evaluating machine learning models for high-temperature superconductors. Lu et al.
96
evaluated the performance of Gaussian kernel ridge regression and GPR in modeling the activation energy of impurities for 408 host-solute systems based on elemental properties. They demonstrated the advantages of using the RMSE in LOG CV for feature selection, because it has similar errors in 5-fold CV but much lower errors in LOG CV compared to using the RMSE in 5-fold CV for feature selection. The development and application of similar evaluation methods contribute to accelerating breakthroughs in material performance and exploration of unknown chemical spaces.
CV evaluation methods typically reflect the average performance of overall prediction accuracy and may not be sensitive enough to samples with large deviations in certain regions. Wu et al.
97
aimed to evaluate the generalization ability of regression models across different target variable ranges. The samples in the test set were divided into three groups based on the target variable PCE values: high-level (A, PCE > 11%), medium-level (B, 7% ≤ PCE < 11%), and low-level (C, 0 ≤ PCE < 7%). By comparing predicted values with experimental values, significant differences in prediction accuracy across different PCE levels were observed. Similar methods enable us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model’s predictive capabilities across different ranges of the target variable.
Highlights
The most commonly used model evaluation methods are k-fold CV and independent test set evaluation. Due to the random nature of their partitioning, the distribution of the test set and training set may be quite similar, allowing them to be used to assess the model’s predictive ability on test sets with distributions similar to that of the training set. However, even if a model performs well in k-fold CV, it does not necessarily indicate strong extrapolation capability. To assess a model’s extrapolation ability regarding the target variable, one should consider employing the kmFCV method. To evaluate a model’s predictive ability in unknown chemical spaces, LOG CV should be used instead. To assess the stability of a model, the dataset can be repeatedly partitioned, and the average evaluation metric can be calculated to represent the model’s performance. Additionally, employing partitioning strategies can evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model within different regions of the target variable. We encourage the use of diverse model evaluation methods. By considering different evaluation results, a more comprehensive understanding of the model can be obtained, thereby identifying its strengths and limitations.
Details in model selection
Many studies choose a model by comparing different models using evaluation metrics computed by (repeated) train-test splitting or k-fold CV
5
,
77
,
98
,
99
. However, Chen et al.
62
independently constructed RR, XGBoost, and SVR models to predict alloy melting points. As all three models exhibited strong performance and showed similar results, a straightforward ensemble model was created by averaging their predictions, referred to as the R-X-S model. The ensemble model was observed to potentially exhibit lower performance than individual models on specific samples; however, when considering overall evaluation metrics, it outperformed any individual model. In essence, it traded off some predictive accuracy on certain samples to mitigate the predictive risk associated with individual models, resulting in a more consistent model performance. Similarly, Zhang et al.
66
employed a stacking ensemble algorithm to integrate the high-performing light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and categorical boosting (CatBoost) models. Compared to individual models, the 10-fold CV
R
2
improved, and RMSE decreased. Therefore, in addition to individual models, ensemble strategies can also be employed to enhance model stability and accuracy.
In addition to relying solely on model accuracy as the criterion for model selection, some studies also consider factors such as model interpretability, the ability to quantify uncertainty, and extrapolation capability. Iwasaki et al.
100
did not select more accurate models like neural network (NN) and SVM to predict the thermopower (SSTE) of spin-driven thermoelectric (STE) materials. Instead, they adopted an interpretable ML approach, the factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference hierarchical mixture of experts (FAB/HMEs). FAB/HMEs constructed piecewise sparse linear models, outperforming RF, LASSO and MLR when predicting
S
STE
. The model revealed distinct behaviors between magnetic and non-magnetic materials in the context of STE. Consequently, separate models were constructed for non-magnetic and magnetic STE, as illustrated in Fig.
5
. A STE material with the highest
S
STE
at the time was designed using the insights provided by the FAB/HMEs model. On the other hand, other models such as NN, SVM, RF, and MLR attempted to represent the STE phenomenon using a single model for both magnetic and non-magnetic material data. This approach could result in averaging the different dependencies found in each magnetic and non-magnetic STE model, potentially obscuring important patterns. Hierarchical data structures are common in materials data, and FAB/HMEs, capable of discovering and representing this data hierarchy, can assist scientists in more effectively modeling and comprehending physical phenomena, thus accelerating material discovery.

included the Kriging algorithm as one of the candidate methods to build a model for predicting the photocurrent of halide perovskite materials. Kriging is suitable for exploring various chemical systems due to its capability to generate predictive values along with confidence intervals, allowing for the quantification of uncertainty
102
. This feature has proven attractive for design space exploration. Lyu et al.
83
used ML algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, etc., to predict the dimensions of lead iodide-based perovskite materials. Both LR and SVM models achieved the highest accuracy, but considering the simplicity and interpretability of constructing mathematical expressions, this study ultimately chose the LR model with an L1 penalty.
Decision trees and tree-based models, including RF and Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), typically exhibit strong fitting capabilities within the training data domain and possess high interpretability. However, they encounter challenges when it comes to extrapolation, which entails predicting values for data points lying beyond the bounds of the training data
103
,
104
. These models employ feature values from the training set as thresholds for splitting tree nodes. Consequently, all samples outside the training domain are assigned to the same leaf nodes as those situated at the boundaries of the training data. This limitation can result in prediction inaccuracies, especially when the training dataset contains trends, such as those related to time-dependent features

. Additionally, the predicted values are essentially the averages of observed values within the corresponding regions of the training set partitions, constraining the predicted values to fall within the range of the training set’s target variable. Therefore, if the purpose of building a predictive model is to screen for breakthrough performance in virtual samples, tree-based models should not be used, and instead, linear models, neural networks, support vector machines, and similar models should be considered.
Highlights
With numerous machine learning algorithms available, there is no universal algorithm. To select the most suitable algorithm for a given dataset, it is often necessary to model with multiple algorithms and choose the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics. Additionally, ensemble strategies can be employed when several algorithms perform well. When specific requirements arise, such as assessing prediction uncertainty, the Kriging algorithm can be employed. For models requiring interpretability, linear models and decision tree models are prioritized. However, linear models, due to their simplicity, may struggle to fit complex functional relationships. They can be substituted with piecewise linear models, such as FAB/HMEs, which can uncover hierarchical structures within the data, establishing interpretable and highly accurate predictive models. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the limitations of each model. For instance, tree models may have poor extrapolation capabilities, while NN models require a large sample size. Therefore, it is crucial to combine the characteristics of the specific dataset with the modeling objectives to select the appropriate algorithm.

Details of design candidates
Various strategies in both forward prediction and reverse design can be employed to design candidates that meet a single objective. Yang et al.
5
used two methods to optimize the hardness of HEAs, namely the inverse projection (IP)
105
based on the Fisher projection and HTVS, respectively. IP method designed a HEA with hardness 24.8% higher than the highest one in the original dataset. IP is an inverse design method that involves projecting the feature space onto a two-dimensional plane using either principal component projection or Fisher projection. Samples are categorized into superior and inferior classes based on the values of the target variable. Designed points are selected within the regions where superior class samples cluster, and the prediction model is used to predict the target variable for these points. Inverse design of IP is realized by solving a system of equations formed by two projection formulas and boundary conditions. The IP method combines qualitative and quantitative design approaches, enhancing the reliability of candidate designs. The inverse design is usually processed by solving an optimization problem, therefore combining ML models with metaheuristic methods is a promising strategy. Metaheuristic methods, including GA, ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing, can find near-optimal solutions in complex optimization problems with a lot of variables
106
. She et al.
99
used a two-step ML approach to design perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high PCE for doped electron transport layers (ETLs). As shown in Fig.
6
, the first step of ML used an RF regression model combined with GA to predict a series of undoped ETLs for PSCs that could potentially exhibit high PCEs. The second step of ML, also using RF combined with GA, predicted doped ETLs that could lead to high efficiency improvement rates (EIRs). Finally, by multiplying the PCEs of undoped ETLs predicted by the first step of ML with the EIRs of doped ETLs predicted by the second step of ML, the PCEs of doped ETLs for PSCs were obtained. This resulted in PCE predictions of 30.47% for Cs-doped TiO2 ETL (24.53% Cs doping) and 28.54% for S-doped SnO2 ETL (32.85% S doping). In addition to commonly used metaheuristic optimization algorithms, Lu et al.
68
developed the Proactive Searching Progress (PSP) method to realize inverse design. Illustrated in Fig.
7
, this method initiates by generating
N
random samples and employing a Weighted Voting Regressor (WVR) model to predict outcomes for these
N
samples, while simultaneously calculating the error between the predicted values and the expected values (denoted as EE). The distribution of these N points is fitted using a Gaussian process (GP), with the corresponding EE serving as the response. It identifies the point with the smallest EE estimated by the current GP distribution, obtains the true EE for this point using the WVR model, and integrates this point into the GP model to update the current GP distribution. The process continues the search for potential candidates until the EE value from the WVR model falls below a predefined threshold, at which point it is output as a candidate.

Designing candidates with multiple desired performance remains a significant challenge. Wu et al.
60
developed a multi-stage material screening approach to search for stable HOIPs with suitable bandgaps for photovoltaic power generation. The selection process involves several key screening stages: charge neutrality screening, stability screening (requiring appropriate tolerance factor (
T
f
) and octahedral factor (
O
f
) ranges to maintain stable perovskite structures), and ML model screening. In the ML model screening stage, the dataset is randomly split 100 times, and 100 models are constructed. Candidates among the HOIPs are only chosen if the predictions from all 100 models fall within the range of 0.9 ≤
E
g
ML
≤ 1.6 eV. Similarly, to select candidates for garnet phosphors with the desired wavelength and excellent thermal stability, Jiang et al.
77
first used a trained wavelength model to filter phosphors with wavelengths in the range of 480–510 nm. Then, a thermal stability prediction model was combined with an efficient global optimization (EGO) strategy to balance exploitation (aims at finding the best prediction) and exploration (aims at improving the predictive model), and candidates were selected based on expected improvement (EI) ranking. Essentially, both of these cases involve solving multi-objective optimization problems using the ε-constrained method, which means selecting a primary optimization objective and treating the others as constraints. These constraints are typically defined by setting ranges for secondary objective variables. By optimizing the primary objective within the bounds of these secondary objectives, the multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a constrained single-objective optimization problem. The advantage of this strategy is that it ensures that the generated solutions satisfy the constraints, meaning the solutions are feasible.
However, selecting appropriate ranges for the secondary objectives relies on empirical knowledge, and the generated solutions may only approximate the Pareto front. Similar traditional solving methods include the weighted-sum method, but determining the weights for each objective also relies on empirical knowledge. These methods are suitable for researchers experienced in the problem domain who can set appropriate parameters to obtain more accurate solutions.
In addition to traditional multi-objective optimization methods, Pareto-based multi-objective optimization algorithms have been successfully applied in materials design. Compared to ε-constrained and weighted-sum methods with only an optimal solution, Pareto-based multi-objective optimization algorithms provide a set of Pareto-optimal solutions adaptable to diverse application scenarios and requirements. Recently, Li et al.
98
employed the ε-constrained method, weighted-sum method, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to design HEAs with a favorable combination of saturated magnetization and hardness. The experimental results underscored the advantage of NSGA-II in directly identifying a set of optimal compositions with the desired multiple properties. Zhang et al.
64
proposed a multi-objective optimization strategy to find the optimal combination of critical casting dimensions (
D
max
), saturation magnetization (
B
s
), and plasticity for iron-based metallic glasses (MGs). The objective functions were constructed by NN models for predicting
D
max
and
B
s
, along with a plasticity empirical formula. Genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization was performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions, which represent the best trade-offs among the objectives.
Highlights
When designing unknown samples to meet a single target performance, the method of obtaining the best candidates through HTVS is straightforward. However, generated virtual samples require comprehensive coverage of the virtual space. Otherwise, the obtained optimal solution may not necessarily be the best. To a vast virtual space, the computational cost can significantly increase. In such cases, inverse design methods like IP, optimization algorithms or PSP, can result in a more efficient search for the global optimum. When designing samples to meet multiple target performance criteria, traditional methods such as the ε-constrained method and weighted-sum method can be employed. These methods transform the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem for resolution. However, their drawback lies in the reliance on empirical knowledge for parameter setting. Utilizing multi-objective optimization algorithms eliminates the need for mandatory parameter settings in traditional solving methods. Furthermore, the solutions obtained exhibit diversity, allowing for the selection of solutions from the Pareto-optimal set based on varying requirements for the objective variables. The application of multi-objective optimization algorithms in materials science accelerates the design of materials with desired multiple properties. Additionally, candidate selection can account for prediction uncertainty through multiple predictions and by calculating EI.
Details of model analysis
ML model can be used not only to explore uncharted chemical spaces but also to extract physical and chemical insights from model analysis. Wen et al.
76
derived three critical features from eight dimensions related to solid solution strengthening (SSS) in HEAs through feature selection. These features were employed to construct an empirical model for SSS, surpassing existing physics-based models for single-phase HEAs hardness prediction. This advancement has contributed to a better understanding of SSS. Similarly, Pei et al.
107
employed GP classification algorithms to reliably and effectively predict promising solutes for toughening magnesium alloys. Based on the ML results, an assessment of the consistency between two existing ductility descriptors, namely the yttrium similarity index (YSI) and the size-misfit parameter (δ
X
), revealed that 92% and 78% of the results aligned with ML predictions, respectively. These descriptors correspond to two distinct deformation mechanisms, Mechanism I and Mechanism II. As depicted in Fig.
8
, they exhibited a strong correlation, providing insight into a significant debate regarding the dominant ductility mechanisms in these lightweight alloys. This discovery represents a crucial step toward unraveling the mysteries of the primary ductility mechanisms in such materials, showcasing the potential of ML in contributing insights into physicochemical mechanisms from data. These two cases, employing ML methods, have contributed to the advancement of domain-specific knowledge, one through the construction of empirical formulas and the other through the evaluation of various physicochemical mechanisms associated with a specific phenomenon. The application of ML in aiding the exploration of undiscovered patterns still offers significant potential.

Feature analysis can further aid in uncovering physical and chemical patterns. To design high-performance ABO
3
perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Li et al.
79
compared candidates with different B-site elements by analyzing the overpotential distribution, as depicted in Fig.
9a
. The type of B-site element significantly influenced the OER catalytic activity, with perovskites containing elements like Co, Ru, Ir, and Ti at the B-site exhibiting lower overpotentials, indicating higher catalytic activity compared to other series.

In addition to simple statistical analysis, hidden physical and chemical patterns can be discovered using various feature analysis methods. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
108
measures the asymmetric loss of information when an empirical probability distribution is approximated by a model distribution. A higher KL divergence indicates a greater information content for the corresponding descriptor, playing a crucial role in distinguishing between samples from two classification categories. Li et al.
79
categorized candidates into two groups based on their OER activity compared to LaCoO
3
and computed the KL divergence values for important features. In Fig.
9b
, the descriptors with the highest information content (KL divergence > 0.4) were emphasized. The results showed that descriptors related to the electronic structure of the metal B-site are closely associated with the OER activity of perovskites, providing physical insights from data-driven models. Similarly, methods like SHAP and feature importance assessment methods inherent to tree-based models (such as RF) can be employed for feature ranking based on their importance.
SHAP is a method for model interpretation, and its advantage over traditional feature interpretation methods lies in its ability to not only rank the importance of features but also to reflect the positive and negative effects of each feature on each sample, as well as the important patterns of how features contribute to the predictions. This effectively unifies the global and local interpretability attributes of a model. Mai et al.
90
, in predicting the maximum absorption wavelength (
λ
max
) of azo dyes, found a strong positive correlation between the sulfur atom count in the R
2
group and λ
max
according to SHAP analysis. Furthermore, as the number of C-N pairs with a topological distance of 4 increased in the R1 group, the likelihood of a redshift in the molecular
λ
max
also increased. SHAP analysis can determine the range within which a feature positively or negatively contributes to the target variable but does not provide the range of values of the target variable corresponding to the feature within that range. SA can be used to explore how the target variable changes when a selected feature varies while keeping other variables fixed. In the study of polymer bandgaps, Xu et al.
73
conducted SA to understand how the target variable varies with key features. The patterns revealed by SA exhibit significant consistency with correlation analysis, and they can highlight inflection points that correlation analysis has not captured.
However, SA involves keeping other variables fixed while focusing on the variation of the feature of interest, which may lead to conclusions that appear less stable. PDP is a global method that infers the relationship between a feature and the predicted values using all data points in the dataset. It replaces the values of the feature of interest with a given value for all instances in the dataset and calculates their average predicted value as the target variable value for that specific feature value. Therefore, the PDP method is more commonly used compared to SA. These feature analysis methods can be used in combination. Lu et al.
68
, in their research on predicting the bandgap of HOIPs, employed both SHAP and PDP methods simultaneously for feature analysis. It was observed that for features such as TIB (signaled the third ionization energy of the element in the B site),
N
X
(the element name in the X site), and
t
f
, (tolerance factor), the trends and inflection points depicted by SHAP and PDP plots closely matched. As for
τ
f
(improved tolerance factor), it can be observed from the SHAP scatter plots that when its value exceeds 3.50, it tends to reduce the bandgap. Furthermore, the PDP chart further illustrates that within the range of 3.46 to 4.13 for
τ
f
, the bandgap is smaller. Similarly, during the analysis of feature impacts on the hardness of HEAs, Zhang et al.
66
observed that the positive significance of the difference in shear modulus (δG) on the hardness was evident in both SHAP and PDP plots. Therefore, these two methods exhibit consistency but also offer different perspectives, making them complementary when used together.
It is important to note that valuable insights can be gained not only from the feature analysis of training samples but also from the analysis of virtual samples. In the study on the formability of HOIPs, Lu et al.
14
conducted separate analyses of the relationships between features and formability probabilities for both the training samples and virtual samples. The SHAP analysis was performed on the training samples, and scatter plots for the 4257 virtual samples, depicting the relationship between features and formability probabilities, were created. The analysis revealed consistent breakpoints for both training and virtual samples with respect to atomic radius at the A-site (ARA) and ionic radius at the A-site (IRA) features. Regarding the tolerance factor (
t
f
), the analysis of the training set indicated that t
f
values within the range of 0.80 to 1.01 favored the formation of perovskites, while the analysis of virtual samples found that when 0.82 <
t
f
< 1.01, the probability of perovskite formation exceeded 90.0%. It can be observed that there is a significant consistency in the favorable feature ranges for the formability of HOIPs between virtual and training samples. Furthermore, due to the broader and more uniform distribution of feature values corresponding to virtual samples, they can be employed to calibrate the feature ranges of training samples. However, the reliability of the insights gained from virtual samples relies on the accuracy of the model. Predictions for interpolated virtual samples may be more accurate, while there is a higher extrapolation risk for virtual samples that fall outside the feature ranges of the training set, and caution should be exercised when using such predictions.
Highlights
The model analysis, driven by predictive results, extracts physical and chemical insights from data. This includes refining empirical formulas, exploring consistency between ML results and different mechanisms, and assessing feature impact on the target variable. Feature analysis can be conducted through simple statistical analysis or using methods such as feature importance ranking based on KL divergence, SHAP, SA and PDP. SHAP calculates the contribution of each feature to the target variable for each sample. It can be utilized as a local analysis method for individual samples or as a global method to compute the average impact of the features of interest on the target variable across all samples. It is widely employed for model interpretability. SA directly quantifies how the target variable changes with variations in the features of interest. However, its results may lack stability because it fixes other features at their mean values when computing the target values corresponding to the features of interest, which does not accurately reflect the distribution of real data. PDP can serve as an alternative to SA, as it utilizes all data during computation, resulting in more stable outcomes. These methods can be combined and mutually reinforce each other. The feature analysis results of virtual samples are consistent with those of training samples because these patterns are determined by the model. Due to the features of virtual samples are more densely distributed within the same range, they could be regarded as supplementary to the training set results. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the results of virtual samples potentially lead to overinterpretation of patterns, especially in regions where the feature distribution of training samples is sparse.
Discussion
In conclusion, ML is playing an increasingly important role in materials design and discovery. Nevertheless, various strategies can be employed at the same stage of the ML workflow, and these choices can significantly influence the final outcomes. In this review, case studies were conducted to explore specific details within the general ML workflow and to analyze the corresponding results comprehensively. Based on the analysis and comparison, suitable strategies were recommended for different contexts.
In the future, the application process of ML in materials should be standardized, including the selection of appropriate strategies for details in the workflow. Significant improvements can be made in data management, enhancing the extrapolation capabilities of ML algorithms, integrating domain knowledge, and improving model interpretability within the ML workflow. We propose the following future directions for exploration in this field, focusing on these key aspects:
(1)
Data management: Data forms the cornerstone of ML, determining the upper limit of model accuracy. More data, especially failed data, are crucial for improving the accuracy and stability of ML models. Due to the scarcity of reported failed samples, Lu et al.’s
14
study illustrates an imbalance with 539 HOIPs and 24 non-HOIPs, posing a significant challenge in correctly classifying HOIPs and non-HOIPs. Similarly, in regression tasks, having only high-performing positive samples in the dataset can lead to an overestimation of the target variable when predicting unknown samples. Hence, there should be greater sharing of experimental data, including unsuccessful experiments. Furthermore, the recording of experimental data should be more standardized and comprehensive, encompassing detailed documentation of processes and experimental parameters. These experimental parameters can be utilized as features in ML, further enhancing model accuracy and optimizing material processing parameters.
(2)
Extrapolation methods: The pursuit of designing materials with breakthrough properties is a paramount goal for researchers in the materials field. Currently, many ML algorithms can effectively fit existing data, but their contribution to groundbreaking advancements in the materials domain has been limited. This limitation arises from the poor extrapolation capabilities of many ML algorithms. However, there is currently limited research on evaluating the extrapolation abilities of models, which requires further development. Additionally, it is urgent to develop algorithms with strong extrapolation capabilities.
(3)
Domain knowledge and model interpretability: A recent report
109
on the role of AI in advancing science identifies domain knowledge incorporation as one of the three major challenges in developing AI systems. The report highlights that current ML and AI approaches are typically domain-agnostic, treating each dataset in the same manner, thereby overlooking the domain knowledge that extends far beyond the original data. The success of ML across various domains is rooted in its remarkable ability to learn from vast amounts of data. However, it remains far from achieving human-level intelligence. Even in domains where machines may outperform humans, considering the immense data requirements and energy consumption, the behavior of machines resembles that of diligent learners rather than intelligent ones
85
. Integrating human knowledge into ML can significantly reduce the data requirements, enhance the reliability and robustness of ML, and facilitate the development of interpretable ML systems
85
. Furthermore, the utilization of various model interpretability methods enables ML models to present the patterns they have identified in an understandable manner. This is crucial for unveiling the mysteries behind the ‘black box’ of ML. Such methods facilitate the validation of existing patterns and the discovery of unknown theories, thereby fostering the continuous deepening of domain knowledge.

Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting the paradigm of two-phase heat transfer research. Recent innovations in AI and machine learning uniquely offer the potential for collecting new types of physically meaningful features that have not been addressed in the past, for making their insights available to other domains, and for solving for physical quantities based on first principles for phase-change thermofluidic systems. This review outlines core ideas of current AI technologies connected to thermal energy science to illustrate how they can be used to push the limit of our knowledge boundaries about boiling and condensation phenomena. AI technologies for meta-analysis, data extraction, and data stream analysis are described with their potential challenges, opportunities, and alternative approaches. Finally, we offer outlooks and perspectives regarding physics-centered machine learning, sustainable cyberinfrastructures, and multidisciplinary efforts that will help foster the growing trend of AI for phase-change heat and mass transfer.

Introduction
Understanding phase-change heat transfer is important to numerous applications related to the advancement of energy conversion and thermal management systems. In particular, liquid-vapor phase-change processes continuously garner the interest of thermal scientists due to their ability to transfer large amounts of energy effectively
1
. Central to these processes is the nucleation of the dispersed phase (i.e., bubbles and droplets for boiling or condensation processes), where the continuous phases are liquid and vapor, respectively. The bubble or droplet dynamics can be manipulated by modulating experimental designs, including surface properties, structures, and materials, to push the limit of heat transfer performances
2
. Historically, bubble and droplet dynamics have been studied through the combination of nucleation theory
3
,
4
,
5
, thermodynamics
6
,
7
,
8
,
9
, and phenomenological correlations
10
. Yet despite phase-change heat transfer’s century-long history, fully understanding its mechanistic relationships by linking experimental factors, complex nucleation statistics, and thermal performance remains an elusive challenge. A primary reason for this obscurity can be attributed to
data inconsistency
caused by a wide variety of operating conditions and experimental protocols along with measurement uncertainties
11
. Another reason is the
difficulty in quantifying boiling and condensation behaviors
because of their highly dynamic, complex, and high-dimensional nature
12
,
13
. Further difficulties arise in the
management and curation of data streams
, which have high implications for predicting and forecasting multi-phase flow patterns. The key concepts in phase-change heat transfer are listed in Box

.
In the era of big data, transforming large quantities of data into useful knowledge plays an increasingly important role across various engineering disciplines. Artificial intelligence (AI), a term coined by John McCarthy in 1955, was defined by him as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” It has emerged as a dominant force for performing data-to-knowledge conversion and presents an attractive complement to traditional computational science. AI technologies simulate human intelligence processes through machines, particularly computer systems. Current AI technologies primarily fall in the category of “narrow” AI, which refers to an AI that can outperform humans on a particular task
14
. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI where machines can learn without explicitly being programmed
15
. Neural networks trained using statistical methods make inferences from data that can lead to decision-making. Deep learning (DL), a class of ML inspired by our brain’s neural network, can learn multi-level representations of data hierarchically
16
. While most existing AI solutions are still considered black boxes, the scope of ML and DL transcends mere nonlinear regression. Notably, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now able to discover new material
17

Box 1 Key concepts in phase-change heat transfer
The boiling and condensation heat transfer performances are typically evaluated by measuring the heat flux in relation to temperature differences between the target surface (i.e., wall) and bulk liquid (i.e., superheat). We summarize important concepts for phase-change heat transfer below:
Heat transfer curve
. The heat transfer curve showcases the temperature difference between the surface
T
s
and the bulk fluid (usually at saturation temperature
T
sat
) and the corresponding heat flux (i.e., the rate of heat transferred per unit projected surface area), where the temperature differences are called the superheat and subcooling for boiling or condensation, respectively. Both boiling and condensation exhibit convection, nucleation-dominated, transition, and film-dominated regimes. The nucleation-dominated regime is commonly referred to as nucleate boiling and dropwise condensation regimes in literature and naturally lies at the heart of nucleation statistics-based research.
Onset of nucleation
. The onset of nucleation (ON), also known as the nucleation incipience, is the point at which the dispersed phase first appears at the heat transfer surface.
Heat transfer coefficient
. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) is the proportionality constant between the heat flux and the temperature difference or the slope of the heat transfer curve. A higher HTC indicates that a greater amount of thermal energy can be transferred (i.e., absorbed or released) at a given temperature difference. In other words, the HTC quantifies the heat transfer efficiency of the phase-change process, and therefore a primary research thrust for thermal engineers is to increase the slope of the heat transfer curve. Because the HTC is intrinsically tethered to trade-offs between the desire for bubble or droplet nucleation and the necessity of removing them from the target surface, understanding the nucleation dynamics becomes an imperative factor to modulate the heat transfer curve
29
.
Critical heat flux
. When plotting the heat transfer curve, the heat flux increases with increasing superheat or subcooling until a critical point. The corresponding heat flux to the critical point is defined as the critical heat flux (CHF), beyond which the HTC decreases sharply, and filmwise boiling or condensation modes develop
29
. Since film-dominated regimes show larger thermal resistance and less effective heat transfer performance, research has focused on strategies to remove bubbles or droplets from the surface before film-dominated regimes begin to dominate

Box 2 Key concepts in AI and machine learning
Understanding AI for phase-change heat transfer requires familiarity with current technologies and their concepts. Below is a short overview of core terminologies in the broadest possible sense, without emphasis on mathematical detail.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are a hierarchical organization of neurons in layers containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of layers is the
depth
of the network. In practice, shallow ANNs may not be sufficiently expressive and have limited learnability
108
. Deep neural networks (DNNs), on the other hand, can learn more complex patterns at various levels of abstraction and are better at generalization
109
. ANNs are represented by a spectrum of different architectures.
Multilayer perceptron
. A perceptron is the simplest form of an ANN binary classifier developed in the 1950s
110
. While a single-layer perceptron consists of only the input units and an output layer, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) contains one or more layers (i.e., hidden layers) between the input and output to learn more complex, nonlinear functions
110
.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are a type of ANNs showing remarkable success in the detection, segmentation, and recognition of objects and regions in images
34
. CNNs typically comprise of convolutional layers for extracting feature maps, pooling layers to aggregate features, and fully connected layers for high-level reasoning prior to making predictions at the output layer
109
,
111
.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
are a class of ANNs that uses sequential or time series data. It includes a recurrent hidden state whose activation at each time depends on that of the previous time
109
. Hence, RNNs are capable of capturing and storing long-dependence relationships, which has led to their common use for temporal problems
109
.
Supervised learning
is a machine learning methodology where a model is trained using labeled data (meaning data that is annotated with correct answers or labels)
109
. The training dataset plays a vital role for supervised learning algorithms to effectively learn. It is also worth noting that while supervised learning is currently the dominant learning paradigm in machine learning, it is not representative of human and animal learning
112
.
Unsupervised learning
, in contrast to supervised learning, focuses on discovering underlying patterns in unlabeled datasets
34
. Although unsupervised learning models learn from raw data without any predefined labels or target outputs, there is often a need for larger training data to yield desired results as complex phenomena can often be challenging to decode without domain expertise or prior knowledge.
Transfer learning
is the adapting of a pre-trained model for a wide range of downstream tasks, using minimal additional data for each new task
113
. For example, leveraging feature representations from models already trained on large datasets such as ImageNet
114
and Common Objects in Context (COCO) datasets
115
, have become a central part of models
116
.
Box 3 Key concepts of digital inference
Digital inference has assisted thermal engineers over the last several decades. With the advancement of DL models for CV, researchers can now extract nucleation features with unprecedented resolutions.
Computer vision
. Computer vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to infer meaningful information from images and videos.
Image classification
. The origin of digital image inference can be traced back to automated image classification approaches, where predictions describing the image or a list of classes of objects in an image are provided based on their classification scores
117
.
Object detection and localization
. While image classification by itself has merits and practicality, the features that it uses have limited capability to provide physically meaningful descriptors for nucleation processes. The next incremental step from coarse to fine image inference is object detection and localization, the task of determining where objects (i.e., bubbles and droplets) are located in a given image (object localization) and which category each object belongs to (object classification)
118
. At this stage, valuable information such as the rough size, distribution, and spatial coordinates of the nuclei can be collected in the form of bounding boxes or centroids.
Semantic segmentation
. Semantic segmentation allows for more detailed spatial analysis (e.g., void fraction) by labeling every pixel according to its class
119
.
Instance segmentation
. Progressing for finer inference leads to instance segmentation, which provides separate labels for each object belonging to the same object class.
Object tracking
. Object tracking for collecting high-fidelity spatio-temporal nucleation statistics is a hierarchical process that has important implications for better understanding mechanistic two-phase nucleation principles. At the lower end of the hierarchy, spatial features such as the two-phase demography (i.e., size, location, distribution) or void fraction provide foundational information describing how bubbles or droplets nucleate, coalesce, and depart. At the higher end of the hierarchy, the extracted features are linked to time, rendering features (i.e., growth rate, nucleation interaction type, departure frequency, departure size, rising velocity) that can express the surface activity with much more context.
Overview
Within the phase-change heat transfer community, the plethora of recent AI-based approaches has motivated heat transfer researchers to explore their capabilities to advance fundamental nucleation sciences under a new paradigm (Fig.
1
). Despite its potential, adaptations or discussions of AI technique have traditionally been slow in this field, which makes this untapped disruptive technology even more attractive. Figure
2
summarizes the number of publications on AI and two-phase heat transfer research areas. According to the results, the publications for pure AI or two-phase heat transfer (approximately 100 K) outweigh those from AI-integrated two-phase heat transfer research (i.e., AI + phase-change) categories by several orders of magnitude (approximately 100). While this ratio suggests that AI-integrated two-phase heat transfer research is relatively new, it also implies that this subfield is growing at a rate that exceeds that of both individual fields. Indeed, with the ongoing AI “gold rush” taking place in this field, the time is ripe to carefully review recent publications. To this end, the current article addresses the pressing need for a thorough review, explaining the core ideas of AI technologies, the innate challenges involved with phase-change processes and limited use of AI in the past (Fig.
1a
), current implementation status and challenges (Fig.
1b
), and future outlooks for two-phase heat transfer research (Fig.
1c
). The article builds on prior reviews that introduced the intersection of AI and heat transfer in either a broad sense
22
, or for different applications facing disparate challenges than those of boiling and condensation heat transfer

State-of-the-art AI technologies for phase-change heat transfer
The article first discusses current AI technologies available in the heat transfer community (Fig.
1b
) categorized based on how they target major and relevant two-phase heat transfer problems existing today. AI technologies are broadly divided into three categories, namely
meta-analysis
,
physical feature extraction
, and
data stream analysis
.
Meta-analysis
Meta-analysis on multiple datasets is generally conducted to provide a holistic description of phase-change heat transfer by either corroborating consistent datasets or revisiting conflicting datasets, usually in the form of tabular data
28
. This is important because both experimental and computational data collection in this field is expensive and requires significant upfront investment. Additionally, various combinations of experimental factors—including the material, thickness, surface roughness or structures, and surface/working fluid wettability—exert significant influence on the datasets
29
. Moreover, the cumulative data available today have high variance and is hypersensitive towards various operating conditions
30
, mounting protocols
31
, characterization procedures
32
, and the personnel’s experience level. Once meta-datasets are collected, data dimensionality is orders of magnitude larger, making it challenging to understand. To address these challenges, a recent movement in the thermal science field seeks to exploit available scientific advances through
machine learning-assisted meta-analysis
(Fig.
3
).

artificial neural networks for meta-regression analysis.

Data-driven hypothesis approach
ML models can be efficient by assisting professionals to make holistic data-driven hypothesis development by learning big data. ML-assisted meta-analysis can play a role in learning knowledge from data and extracting data from knowledge, as described in Fig.
3
. The first step introduces building hypotheses based on accumulated datasets to answer scientific questions in phase-change heat transfer (Fig.
3a
). After two-phase experiments are designed and performed (Fig.
3b
), the experimental factors (tabular data) (Fig.
3c
) are then used to train neural networks to find the relations between the experimental factors and their output (heat transfer performance) (Fig.
3d
), thus helping researchers inform their understanding and decisions with data.
Unlike traditional theory-driven approaches, which rely on the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of the observed phenomena, data-driven approaches can uncover statistical relationships and patterns solely from data even without explicit knowledge of the underlying physics or mathematical functions. This characteristic enables ML models achieving high-accuracy predictions to be trained in a matter of hours compared to the extensive period and resources required to develop new heat transfer theories. However, data-driven approaches typically require larger diverse datasets for generalization, the size of which depends on the specific problem, and lack the interpretability offered by theory-driven approaches.
Regression models
Most ML-based meta-analysis models utilize regression analysis to link experimental factors with non-dimensional numbers or global heat transfer quantities such as CHF, HTC, or pressure drop over the entire system (Supplementary Table
1
). The generic feed-forward ANN architecture, also known as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
33
, and random forest (RF) methods have been the most popular
33
, probably because they are some of the most well-understood techniques in literature today. Both ANNs (or MLPs) and RF are exceptional at modeling complex nonlinear relationships, with the general idea of approaching problems by deconstructing them into smaller simpler units. ANNs are organized into layers of interconnected nodes, in which “weights” are assigned to represent the value of information assigned to an individual node
34
. Similarly, RFs statistically identify important features, create multiple randomly chosen weak decision trees, and collect their votes to make the final electoral decision. To handle complexity and overfitting issues, ANNs can adjust hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers and units, regularization techniques, and learning rates, whereas RFs can modulate the number of trees, the maximal size or depth of the single tree, and sampling rate
35
. ANNs typically have more flexibility in their architecture designs, while RFs, although less explainable than conventional decision trees
36
, are reported to possess potentially better interpretability than the so-called black-box predictions of typical ANNs
35
. In general, no single ML model works the best across all problems, and therefore it is good practice to compare the performance of different techniques or create a hybrid model that combines multiple feature types
37
. Other ML algorithms that have previously been investigated include the support vector machines (SVMs)
33
, boosting algorithms
33
,
38
, cascade feedforward (CF) networks
38
, radial basis function (RDF)
38
, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
39
, deep belief networks (DBNs)
40
, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
41
, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
42
,
43
.
Challenges and opportunities
The training data for meta-analysis models are often inadequate or sporadic, which can pose a great challenge for developing robust ML models. The training data from experiments that exist today are sparse due to the prohibitive cost of acquiring more experimental data points, especially considering the difficulties associated with replicating most nm – μm scale bottom-up fabricated surfaces
2
. On the other hand, training data from simulation models are relatively denser, but are limited to extremely simple cases. Recent studies have suggested that
adding physics into the learning process
and
developing surrogate ML models
can address these issues by efficiently training ML models with limited training resources
44
,
45
.
First, breakthroughs in physics-informed machine learning (e.g., PINNs) have demonstrated that data from both measurements and simulations, and the underlying laws of physics can be integrated into the loss function of the neural network, thereby providing strong theoretical constraints to prevent models from generating unreasonable predictions. This not only allows models to train with less data than is typical for over-parameterized DL models by narrowing the search space, but also enables them to estimate values that extend beyond the trained data scope. Although a major challenge remains in the search and development of physical models that best represent the increased volume, velocity, and variety of available data, other communities suggest that PINNs can succeed
21
,
46
, even for such ill-conditioned problems, in cases where other models cannot. This suggests new research opportunities for meta-analysis implementations in the phase-change heat transfer community.
Second, developing surrogate ML models that sensibly augment the training data to generate diverse problem instances can improve the model’s generalizability even with minimal training data. A surrogate model is a trained emulator that learns to approximate solutions through known input-output behaviors when an outcome of interest cannot be easily measured or computed. Therefore, filling in the gaps of these scattered data points will allow the models to learn higher-dimensional insights that can be extended to unexplored study regimes.
Physical feature extraction
Beyond the meta-data analysis, it is imperative to extract physically meaningful features from visual data. Digital inference and extraction of datasets have the potential to enhance our understanding of new physics within large datasets by enabling a full description about two-phase physics. One area of particular interest is the quantification of nucleation behaviors during two-phase processes, which has been a focus since the pioneering work of Nukiyama and Schmidt
47
,
48
. While visualizing nucleation behaviors has naturally become an inseparable part of phase-change studies
49
,
50
,
51
,
52
,
53
,
54
, the sheer complexity and volume of bubble and droplet activities (Fig.
4a and c
) make quantifying these activities a daunting challenge. In this regard, AI-assisted CV can be effective at performing image analysis tasks with high-level accuracy but with far greater bandwidth
12
,
13
,
55
. Most noticeable advances come from characterizing two-phase nucleation features with the basis of modern CV tasks from CNN models built for digital image inference tasks (Box
3
).

The only studies that have been able to investigate nucleation dynamics across a relatively wide heat flux range are ones that utilize bottom-to-top infrared (IR) imaging techniques, in which the translation from bottom IR bubble statistics to actual bubble morphologies are not well understood. Literature review of
d

Only 11% of the reviewed studies demonstrated fully coupled heat and mass transfer analysis based on droplet statistics, where 4 of the 6 coupled analysis studies were done manually. The references that have helped form the conclusions in this figure for pool boiling and condensation are provided in Supplementary Table
4
and Supplementary Table
5
, respectively.

Overview of nucleation statistics and heat and mass transfer
Concurrent with the advances in AI and CV has been an increasing demand to support a stronger connection between bubble and droplet statistics and thermal performances. For example, a significant portion of extant bubble dynamics studies only reports low- to moderate-heat flux regimes, leaving an extensive range of high-heat flux regimes unexplored during pool boiling (Fig.
4b
; Supplementary Table
4
). Similarly, droplet nucleation statistics are also highly indicative of hidden condensation heat and mass transport mechanics. However, only a handful of studies have attempted to extract spatio-temporal instances (STI) that are essential for decrypting heat transfer analysis. According to a brief literature review of 56 recent studies reporting droplet dynamics from 2015 (Fig.
4d
; Supplementary Table
5
), the vast majority report only spatial features or spatio-temporal group-based (STG) analysis, where relatively simple traditional CV algorithms or manual labor are still favored (Fig.
4d
). In addition, only 11% of the reviewed studies demonstrate heat and mass transfer analysis coupled with droplet statistics, further underlining the need for a stronger connection between the two approaches (Fig.
4d
inset).
Traditional computer vision
For a very long time, rudimentary image processing algorithms have extracted basic nucleation features to describe phase-change phenomena
56
,
57
,
58
,
59
. These traditional CV approaches use relatively simple processing algorithms such as binarization, denoising, flooding, and interactive separation of connected objects to capture the most basic physical descriptors such as bubble or droplet size and distribution
57
,
60
. While these approaches are quite useful and swift, they still ultimately rely on handcrafted features that inevitably require significant setting optimizations often under-reported in the literature
61
,
62
. To address this issue, there have been efforts to develop shape filters or reconstruction algorithms such as built-in circle finder scripts or multi-step shape reconstruction procedures that specifically exploit the circular shape of bubbles and droplets
60
,
63
,
64
,
65
,
66
,
67
. Yet, due to these methods’ inherent imposition of rules, it has been difficult for traditional CV models to adapt to image inventories from the broader research community, with numerous studies reporting unstable predictions, even with a slight change of lighting
66
,
67
.
Machine learning-assisted computer vision
Recent integrations of DL models into CV have brought a paradigm shift in how researchers perceive and utilize visual data to tackle difficult problems. DL models “learn” salient features of the target object, thereby requiring less expert analysis and parametric fine-turning, and possess superior flexibility in adapting to custom datasets compared to traditional CV approaches
68
. For the time being, studies implementing models with CNN backbones have seen the most success due to their proficiency at handling image data
12
,
13
,
55
,
69
.
For boiling, the ability to extract spatio-temporal bubble statistics has proven direct implications for heat flux partitioning analysis (See Supplementary Note
1
), the process of understanding what heat transfer mechanisms constitute the boiling heat flux at any given stage
70
,
71
,
72
, as well as flow instability analysis
73
. However, extracting a sufficient amount of classical boiling features (i.e., departure diameter, nucleation site density, departure frequency) from imaging data has been an inherently burdensome and evasive task. The autonomous curation of high-quality bubble statistics at the large scale has been shown to be achievable through DL-assisted segmentation and tracking
73
,
74
, enabling the quantitative mapping of bubble dynamics between different boiling surfaces at high resolutions
12
.
Condensation studies have shown that heat transfer can be effectively quantified by collecting statistics of group of droplets or individual droplets (See Supplementary Note
2
) and integrating them over the entire surface
13
,
69
. A study on group-based droplet statistics has shown that the overall time-averaged droplet shedding frequency can be used to calculate the heat transfer rate by using Supplementary Equation
5
and
6
, which ultimately reduced the high (20 – 100%) measurement uncertainty of conventional temperature and flow sensors less than 10%
69
. In another study, collecting single-droplet-level statistics imposed with energy balance equation has allowed for the mapping of the evolving heat transfer of condensing surfaces with extreme spatio- and temporal- resolutions of 300 nm and 200 ms, respectively
13
.
The recent demonstrations of statistics-driven heat transfer quantifications are particularly exciting because they enable the robust comparison and de-coupling of the multi-dimensional relationship among nucleation parameters, heat transfer performances, and structural design. In addition, these techniques can be used to simultaneously compare the heat transfer performances on a single surface with different structures or wettabilities
69
, which not only minimizes time and labor resources but also essentially eliminates uncertainties caused during separate experiment trials.
A summary of studies that quantify boiling and condensation nucleation behaviors from 2015–2022 are provided in Fig.
5
and Supplementary Table
4
–
6
. We define real-time prediction for models that have the capability of making predictions in live streams, quasi-real-time prediction for models that require an interventional processing step, and extensive prediction for models that report an undefined amount of time. The extracted physics are categorized as spatial, STG, STI, and hidden, which refers to the non-intuitive features of the hidden layers in ANNs.

Challenges and opportunities
DL-based nucleation feature extraction models are still far from being widely adopted in the heat transfer community, as evident in Fig.
5
. The fact that despite modern advances in CV, manual analysis is still a highly favored method for quantifying nucleation dynamics suggests that there exists a gap between thermal and computer scientists. Therefore, further efforts should be considered to make these ML-based quantification methods more efficient and user-friendly by
fine-tuning the models to be suitable for specific two-phase conditions
and
improving training methodologies
.
One challenge is about how two-dimensional image sequences can accurately represent three-dimensional phenomena. This representation often results in different subproblems specific to two-phase phenomena such as occlusion (situations when an object fully or partially hides another object of the same class from the optical viewpoint), cluster, and low resolution. One method that researchers have investigated involves the refining of initially predicted results through multi-step shape reconstruction processes
75
,
76
,
77
,
78
. While initial object detection methods may vary (i.e., bounding box, regional proposal, image segmentation), the concept of reconstructing the digital inference from initially rough object outlines to its true shape remains the same
75
,
76
,
77
,
78
. However, these models are not programmed or trained to inherently recognize the occlusion phenomena themselves and are therefore limited to weakly occluded instances. Researchers soon realized that the model’s predictive capability can be finetuned to specific problems by modulating the training dataset. By customarily labeling droplets that were blurred by motion, researchers successfully trained the model to predict images captured at low framerates
69
. In another study, a model was trained to accurately predict occluded droplets by custom-labeling droplets that formed underneath larger droplets
79
. Other efforts include the use of synthetic datasets created from generative adversarial networks (GAN)
75
, or simulations
80
. The rationale of using such synthetic datasets to train is to carefully design a dataset with a controlled amount of object occlusion, nucleation sites, object density, and size to emphasize model learning for difficult scenarios. Hence, there must be a continuous effort to explore various training sets to investigate what and how the model learns, depending on the research objective.
Another challenge is centered upon data preparation. Due to the intrinsically complex phenomena being studied, data labeling requires experts. Most upcoming models use supervised learning, which requires training datasets in the form of labeled images. The image labeling process, called image annotation, can take up to several months to manually prepare a complete dataset for training and validation
13
. More often, the ground truth for the labeling is subjective and involves human intervention, making unanimous agreement among annotators impossible
81
. To combat such discrepancies, researchers have proposed using cost-effective, human-in-the-loop curations or semi-supervised learning that can alleviate annotation labor and increase labeling consistency
82
,
83
. For example, a recent study proposed a multi-step cycle of initial pretrained model predictions, human-aided error identification and correction, and retraining on an updated dataset
83
. While training an initial model to start the loop remains an ongoing challenge, abundant research opportunities exist developing in fully autonomous labeling pipelines using deep generative models to conditionally generate sequential visual scenes that mimic real states
84
,
85
,
86
, or even label-free unsupervised learning-based nucleation feature extractors to reduce time and labor involved in training and validating models.
Above all, the effort-to-reward ratio for exploring key features that describe underlying boiling and condensation mechanisms significantly favors researchers today. For example, features that connect nuclei interactions and heat transfer have been rarely discussed in the literature but can now be studied in depth with light algorithmic adjustments. Furthermore, big data trends of long-term nuclei statistics can provide rational mechanistic insights but are yet to be reported. By adding a tracking module to an object detection framework, researchers have proved that features with substantially higher-order insights could be extracted from videos with minimum modifications.
Data stream analysis
Another theme in AI research related to phase-change is to comprehend the
transient
nature of meta-data or visual data during phase-change processes. Given the strong yet complex correlation between “in-motion” data and heat transfer performance, researchers have classified the multi-phase flow patterns into various categories
2
,
29
. For example, the cyclic nucleation behaviors that constitute the heat transfer curves (Box
1
) have traditionally been categorized into natural convection, nucleation-dominated, transition, and film-dominated regimes
29
. Evolving flow patterns in flow boiling systems have been classified into liquid, bubbly, slug, annular, mist, and vapor regimes
87
. Real-time data stream analysis using AI has the potential to identify or predict nucleation phases and patterns, which can be applied in smart boiling and condensation systems (Fig.
6a
) for adaptive or predictive decision-making.
Fig. 6: Data stream analysis.
Understanding streaming data can be utilized to build
a
smart two-phase systems that make real-time adaptations by receiving feedback from systems using either discrete or continuous models.
b
On the one hand, unstable and transient multi-phase flow patterns are classified into discrete outputs when using discrete models. These classifications can offer instant feedback to change device settings when differences in flow patterns are detected.
c
Continuous models have implications for real-time predictions as well as time-series forecasting. The models can use time-series texts or visual images to forecast a CHF event and stops the system in real-time before the event occurs.

Discrete models
It is important to identify transient and unstable two-phase patterns into discrete class outputs, which is equivalent to the traditional ML classification problem
88
. The successful identification of patterns will help devices or systems operate under optimal conditions depending on their specific requirements, as illustrated in Fig.
6
. For example, nucleate boiling in passive two-phase heat transfer devices, such as heat pipes, is typically detrimental to the device’s performance due to significant heat and mass transfer reduction caused by entrapped vapor bubbles inside the wick
89
. By contrast, the creation of small and replenishable droplets and bubbles is favorable to facilitating heat transfer in high-power heat exchangers
1
. In these nucleation-favoring applications, identifying the transition from the nucleation-dominated regime to the film-dominated regime is crucial to maintain high heat transfer performances as well as safe operating conditions
1
,
2
Despite its significance, there have been only a few ML studies that demonstrate these classification tasks (Fig.
6b
). The classification can be executed by using different types of data, ranging from signal patterns collected from sensors to qualitative visual descriptions of gas and liquid phase morphologies
90
. Since visual descriptors are outwardly more intuitive, the majority of studies have utilized visualization-based ML classification models (Supplementary Table
6
). Naturally, CNN models have been heavily adopted to stream classification problems, with many models exceeding 98% prediction accuracy
55
,
91
. One study showed that CNN models could even deal with difficult visual cases, such as the transition from nucleate to film boiling, which trained experts cannot distinguish with any reasonable certainty
55
. It is worth noting that approaches that use structured data (i.e., non-imaging data) are also important, for they allow data stream classification where visualization might be limited or even inaccessible (e.g., in-tube flows) but is rarely addressed
92
,
93
.
Continuous models
In addition to discrete outputs, ML can also be employed to predict and forecast continuous outputs (Fig.
6c
) using regression analysis. Regression methods are proficient at determining casual relations between independent and dependent variables and therefore have major applications for numerical and visual time-series forecasting (Fig.
6c
; Supplementary Note
3
)
94
. Both time-series forecasting methods utilize transient data streams to predict future outcome trends (Fig.
6c
), but visual forecasting approaches reconstruct the data into visual scenes and are viewed to be more computationally expensive.
Continuous models are especially appealing for prediction and forecasting tasks because they can potentially be trained to encode the context of the two-phase phenomena, offering a great advantage over traditional sensors and probes. The models often hypothesize that a DL model can be trained to predict heat and mass transfer using secondary, higher-resolution characterization methods, such as visualization as an input. This would effectively allow the model to make more “physically-intuitive” or “scene-incorporating” predictions. Recent studies have confirmed this hypothesis, showing that vision-based models are highly sensitive to physically interpretable features such as the number and size of bubbles
91
, and there are strong correlations between collected bubble parameters and boiling heat flux intensity
55
.
Challenges and opportunities
Although the main keywords of data stream analysis are “real-time” and “forecasting,” neither one of these goals has been adequately met in the existing literature. A noticeable flaw is the use of previously collected data streams instead of live-streaming data. Therefore, future goals must shift the current paradigm of data stream analysis to
streaming data analysis
, where models train on more realistic data. The main keys to achieving this goal are to improve model transferability, explore indicative features, and expedite prediction time.
The first key is to improve model transferability factoring in the diverse boundary conditions that contribute to the complex and heterogeneous two-phase behaviors. While data supports that models can predict accurately settings familiar to the environments in which they were trained, studies customarily mention the need for additional training datasets for new boundary conditions
55
,
91
. Data augmentation or transfer learning techniques can be leveraged to remediate this issue, but only to some extent because they instigate the constant involvement of computer engineers to update the model
55
,
91
. Considering the inevitability and necessity of building
foundational models
, it remains an open question as to whether sufficient data can be collected and used to train models that incorporate the full complexity of the heterogeneous boiling and condensation phenomenon in varying conditions.
Another method to improve ML models is to identify
indicative features
that best represent the two-phase time-series problems. The features can be identified by engineering new features or selecting a new set of features
95
. As such, this process requires significant domain expertise in two-phase heat transfer to understand new features that can capture complex and nonlinear heat transfer performances during phase-change. Due to these aspects, unraveling the enigmatic features that can realize real-time prediction and forecasting is an ongoing challenge. For instance, a recent study utilized dimensionally-reduced image data to forecast future bubble morphologies based on a bidirectional LSTM network
96
. Images provide a visual representation of nucleation dynamics, which ultimately reflect the influence of experimental factors on the system. Consequently, investigating generalizable features that establish connections between nucleation patterns and desired outputs, researchers can potentially achieve a deeper understanding of nucleation phenomena and develop models that can be applied across various experimental conditions, leading to broader and more robust scientific insights. Future work should improve forecasting ML models by exploring a wide range of data types, including structured data (i.e., numerical data, or categorical data; low-dimensional), unstructured data (text, images, audio, video, or multi-modal; high-dimensional), and their hybrids (i.e., multimodal deep learning).
Additionally, it is crucial to evaluate the features based on their processing time, ensuring that they enable real-time prediction and forecasting. Models that utilize structured data inputs have quicker prediction speeds but at the expense of lower levels of physics. In contrast, models using unstructured data can extract physically meaningful features but are time-consuming, as showcased in Fig.
6
. Typically, graphic datasets are highly information-dense and therefore can easily be inundated with redundant or irrelevant pixels (i.e., background data or noise), which requires additional data processing steps to reduce the data dimensionality or filtering important information only
97
. While dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., principal component analysis, resolution scaling) partially address the latency issues of vision-based models, they do so by sacrificing high-frequency image features and by introducing additional preprocessing steps, which have been underreported in many cases. An alternative solution is to selectively exploit only the important information. One recent study showed that this could be done by using neuromorphic event cameras that emulate the human retina, thereby only outputting “meaningful events” (i.e., pixels that display changes in brightness)
97
,
98
. The fundamentally different way that event cameras encode visual scenes allows them to be proficient for applications with strong constraints on latency, power consumption, or bandwidth
99
. In addition, the ability to remove unwanted, stationary background noise potentially allows neuromorphic cameras to resist from generalizability issues stemming from measurements across multiple labs and institutes which may use different experimental setups. While the practical employment of event cameras is vastly underexplored, models that classified boiling regimes by using simulated event streams demonstrated a 300% increase in prediction speed compared to ML models reported elsewhere. Along the same lines, other potential state-of-the-art DL models, such as vision transformers and spiking neural networks, may find applications in this domain for real-time predictions and forecasting.
Outlook
The rapid growth of AI-based solutions has highlighted the potential benefits for the heat transfer community. The impact of these technologies will depend on the degree of active exploration by researchers into these exciting advancements in computer science. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the AI technologies discussed in this review are not independent attempts, but rather, share a symbiotic relationship (Fig.
1c
). Meta-regression analysis allows for holistic decision-making to find optimal two-phase heat and mass transfer performances. Physical feature extraction generates big data that has not been available in the past, which can advance our understanding and serve as the basis for new physical models. The knowledge gained from these attempts is instilled into data stream analysis models to demonstrate futuristic smart phase-change systems.
Future perspectives
Physics-centered machine learning
Quantifying the turbulent and spontaneous characteristics of the multi-phase physics involved with phase-change heat transfer processes with adequate quality that meets the demands of modern research has always posed a great challenge to researchers. Physical sensors or probes, which have been the gold standard for quantitative heat transfer characterizations so far, have limited spatial resolutions due to their genetic size. Besides that, optical measurement techniques such as infrared (IR) thermometry, fluorescence thermometry, and particle image velocimetry are limited to small domains and laboratory settings. On top of all this, there is no existing tool that can measure fluid and vapor properties simultaneously, which is crucial to understanding the underlying transport physics between the two phases. Although high-fidelity two-phase simulations have evolved over the past decades as an alternative solution to this problem, they are computationally expensive and often intractable without large-scale clusters or supercomputers.
The challenges associated with acquiring high-quality data might be addressed by leveraging AI or ML models that combine data with domain knowledge. Advances in ML models that incorporate known physics have demonstrated great potential to achieve accurate and interpretable results by satisfying both the observed data as well as the underlying physical laws
100
,
101
,
102
,
103
,
104
.In the context of phase-change heat transfer, the physics that domain experts can incorporate into ML models lies on such a wide spectrum, ranging from basic continuity equations to instability laws, that there exists abundant opportunities for researchers to explore integrating physics into their ML frameworks. An example of such implementations could be developing ML models that can use experimentally measured properties of one phase (e.g., vapor or liquid) and predict the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields of the other, which is the crux of many two-phase heat transfer problems. In such examples, the physics-respecting properties of ML models will allow domain experts to assess the model’s validity and reliability in a more interpretable manner when it extrapolates beyond the range of observed data. Therefore, we envision that the fusion of data-driven models and domain expertise presents a promising avenue for accelerating scientific discoveries by combining the advantages of both approaches.
Building cyberinfrastructures for two-phase heat transfer
Beyond answering core science questions, it is imperative to develop an array of cyberinfrastructure (CI) technologies (Fig.
1c
), including open-source and reusable data and scalable algorithms and software for long-term sustainability. The envisioned CI ecosystem should be agile and integrated to catalyze new transformative discoveries in heat transfer. This necessitates sustained community collaboration and continuous improvement at every stage.
Due to the nature of nonlinear, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal features during phase-change processes, it is critical to collect various datasets including meta-data, visual data, and transient data that cover different boundary and operating conditions. Unfortunately, collecting all dimensions of the data from computational and experimental efforts has not been addressed in this area. Therefore, it is critical to initiate data clusters following standard procedures discussed and defined by the community. This will enable researchers to access major assets (data and developed ML tools) that are stored in cloud environments and add their own to continue the phase-change cluster development.
In addition, technologies are needed to ensure the safe sharing of data since data owners take on risks when sharing their data with the research community. For example, CryptoNets88 allows neural networks to operate over encrypted data, ensuring that data remain confidential because decryption keys are not needed in neural networks
105
. At the same time, privacy methods must remain sufficiently explainable and transparent to help researchers correct them and make them safe, efficient, and accurate.
With the growth of training data and the complexity of deep learning models, scalable algorithms and software become necessities for solving large-scale problems and resolving fine-scale physics. Training a neural network is generally a time-consuming and challenging process, where the difficulty of the training process scales as the network becomes larger and deeper. Moreover, approaches that incorporate PDE-based soft regularization only add to this difficulty by making the loss landscape even harder to optimize. Accordingly, the benefits of the developed DL tools outweigh the high costs and challenges associated with their training only if the resulting models are generalizable and scalable. A promising approach to improving the scalability of trained models inspired by curriculum learning is to first train with simpler constraints and then couple pre-trained models using domain decomposition strategies to solve the target problem
45
. Another complementary approach is to build foundational models for ML models that embrace the “pre-train and fine-tune” paradigm for science problems. This paradigm has been highly successful in other domains and holds great promise in accelerating scientific advancements, enhancing model performance, and facilitating the efficient transfer of knowledge across related scientific domains. Building on this progress, creating reusable foundational models to learn unsteady single-phase physics in two-phase processes and coupling these models to make predictions for multi-physics phenomena presents one promising future direction for building a generalizable and sustainable CI.
Communicating across multiple disciplines
This review also elucidates the important role that AI can play in transferring knowledge between multiple disciplines, perhaps with emphasis on material and thermofluidic sciences. The nucleation phenomena described in this paper are highly dependent on surface properties (based on their structures and chemistry). Heat transfer performance can be enhanced using nano- or micro-materials that have desired heat and mass transfer properties. The comprehensive understanding about phase-change physics opens new opportunities for materials scientists in the context of materials design. In earlier studies, these processes were not efficient as scientists needed to search through a large range of materials and architectures, but now they can leverage AI-based design tools. For example, AI-assisted data mining toolkits like matminer have seen success in the material sciences by aiding the development and testing of new materials
106
. With access to new datasets, including metadata, visual data, and transient data, a novel collaboration between the heat transfer and materials science communities becomes feasible. We can formulate topology optimization models, explore inverse design techniques, and delve into the realm of multi-objective design as new dimensions in this research. During this process, building an additional layer of communications with computer and data scientists becomes essential. Many of the AI technologies discussed in this review are prototypes derived from successful models developed by computer scientists. These models can aid in the creation of task-specific new models for two-phase tasks. Data scientists can help develop and optimize data architectures that efficiently curate large data streams into meaningful features and identify important data features to address phase-change heat transfer. Successful studies through this convergence will provide a holistic description of phase-change heat transfer dynamics, enabling blueprints for next-generation phase-change thermal management designs. These new designs will, in turn, be translated to many applications, including energy conversion devices, two-phase electronics cooling devices, and water-energy surfaces.

Transmission electron microscopy
Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has become critical for post-acquisition data analysis in (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, imaging and spectroscopy. An emerging trend is the transition to real-time analysis and closed-loop microscope operation. The effective use of ML in electron microscopy now requires the development of strategies for microscopy-centric experiment workflow design and optimization. Here, we discuss the associated challenges with the transition to active ML, including sequential data analysis and out-of-distribution drift effects, the requirements for edge operation, local and cloud data storage, and theory in the loop operations. Specifically, we discuss the relative contributions of human scientists and ML agents in the ideation, orchestration, and execution of experimental workflows, as well as the need to develop universal hyper languages that can apply across multiple platforms. These considerations will collectively inform the operationalization of ML in next-generation experimentation.

Introduction
The most widely used definition of materials science is the study of structure-property relationships and mechanisms that underpin them
1
,
2
. Such relationships extend across multiple length scales – from atomic arrangements and displacements of the order of angstroms to domains and grain structures of tens to hundreds of nanometers to texture relationships across micrometers. The scientific community has expended an enormous amount of effort over the past century to discover these relationships, finding that most material properties originate from structural phenomena occurring across the length scales from an angstrom to a micron. Whether a defect, a dislocation, a domain boundary, or surface strain, features almost invariably fall between these length scales. However, since optical wavelengths are of the order of a few hundred nanometers, these phenomena exist mostly outside its’ purview, although specialized super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has achieved resolution below the Abbe limit down to ~50 nm
3
,
4
.
Imaging with X-ray photons can reach resolutions of a few tens of nanometers; thus, they are an extraordinarily useful tool in materials science
5
,
6
,
7
,
8
. Furthermore, reaching the resolution limits of X-rays can only be done at dedicated synchrotron light sources, which are both expensive and rare. At the same time, these techniques cannot image individual defects, interfaces, dislocations, dopants, or structural information across interfaces – all of which are under the purview of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
. TEM is significantly less expensive than a dedicated synchrotron facility, leading to its ubiquity in materials research
11
,
13
.
Modern electron microscopes are manufactured and operated in two distinct flavors - the first is called conventional TEM (CTEM), where a planar wavefront interacts with the material, and the transmitted wave is recorded with a pixelated electron detector
14
. In the second approach, rather than a plane wave, the electron wavefront is collimated down to an angstrom-scale probe, which is raster scanned across the sample and is thus referred to as scanning TEM (STEM)
15
. Unlike CTEM, the STEM detectors are placed in the diffraction or front focal planes
16
. There is a dizzying variety of detector geometries, but the single most commonly used detector is a ring-shaped single-pixel (integrating) detector, also called an annular detector
17
. With annular detectors, the entire electron count falling on the ring is summed up to generate a single value, and thus a 2D raster scan pattern generates a 2D image from these summed values. In the past decade or so, there has been an interesting divergence: biological EM, especially cryo-EM, has chosen CTEM as their de facto technique, while materials science has increasingly focused on STEM
18
,
19
. The reason for this divergence is the development of aberration correction. In STEM, the imaging resolution with annular detectors is governed by the diameter of the electron probe
20
,
21
,
22
. The smaller the probe, the better the resolution. Correction of spherical aberrations can now generate sub-angstrom probes even for accelerating voltages as low as 30 kV
23
,
24
. Additionally, when STEM detectors are operated in the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode, where the inner collection semi-angle (β) is larger than ~85 mrads, the obtained image contrast is linear and easily interpretable
17
. Individual atomic columns can be distinguished and differentiated based on this technique.
As a result, STEM has emerged as a powerful tool to study materials structure and functionality across length scales from nanometer to atomic
25
and recently to the deep sub-atomic domains
26
. As atomic-resolution studies of 2D and 3D materials become more routine, these observations have been coupled with computer vision techniques to map minute deviations of atomic positions from high symmetry
12
,
27
,
28
,
29
. These approaches have unlocked order parameter fields associated with structural and ferroelectric phase transitions
30
,
31
,
32
and allowed chemical expansion
33
phenomena to be visualized in real space. Such studies, in turn, can be further used to determine the generative physics of materials systems
34
,
35
,
36
. However, a significant drawback of HAADF-STEM is the high dose rates to which samples are exposed, commonly over a million electrons/angstrom
2
37
.
One of STEM’s most primary advantages is that the electron beam can generate both elastic and inelastic scattering, the latter of which can provide spectral information. In elastic scattering, while the electron energy remains unchanged, the electron beam deviates or deflects from its path due to interaction with the electromagnetic potential in the sample. Coherent elastic scattering is the underlying physical basis for both imaging and diffraction measurements. In contrast, inelastic scattering occurs due to beam electrons exchanging their energy with the material’s own orbital electrons and is thus the basis for spectroscopy. The two most widely used spectroscopic techniques in the electron microscope are electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX/EDS/XEDS). EELS measurements have provided insights into the single atom level chemistry
38
by probing the low-energy quasiparticles and provided in-depth information on the dark plasmons and light-induced plasmonic phenomena. Apart from resulting in highly interpretable images, another strength of STEM imaging is that when using annular detectors, both the inelastic and elastic scattering information can be captured simultaneously. Modern electron microscopes have thus evolved into complex multimodal platforms that can simultaneously perform imaging, diffraction space experiments, and spectroscopy, leading to the famous observation that it is “
A Synchrotron in a Microscope
”
20
,
39
.
Another advancement in the field of electron microscopy has been detector development. As mentioned previously, CTEMs use pixelated detectors, while STEMs conventionally use single-pixel annular detectors. Putting a pixelated detector in place of a single-pixel HAADF detector allows microscopists to use exotic detector geometries in post-processing. Even more exciting is the ability to solve for inverse problems, also called ptychography – where the spatial redundancy in the scanning data is used to solve for the microscope parameters and the sample scattering independently of each other. Yet another area is using such data for nanoscale diffraction experiments to calculate strain or polarization with precision that cannot be matched by HAADF-STEM
40
,
41
. The advantages of pixelated detectors have long been known, as Harald Rose speculated on their use cases fifty years back, but the large data volumes they generate have been prohibitive. While standard HAADF-STEM images are on the order of tens of megabytes, these datasets, also called 4D-STEM (2 scanning dimensions, 2 diffraction dimensions in the pixelated detector) are a thousand times larger
42
. Only recently has computing power become widely available to handle such data with comparative ease – a prediction that Earl Kirkland accurately made in the late eighties
43
.
The developments in STEM imaging and spectroscopic techniques over the last decade have brought forth two closely intertwined problems: namely the analysis of bespoke multidimensional datasets in terms of materials functionality and the development of new approaches for microscope operation. For the post-acquisition analysis problems, Noel Bonnett envisioned one of the original perspectives on the field early on
44
,
45
. In 25 years since his visionary papers were published, many of the predicted advances have indeed been realized. Over the last several years, multiple opinion pieces and roadmaps for ML in (S)TEM have been reported
46
,
47
. Particularly over the last four years, the advances in deep learning algorithms and low entry barriers due to the development of high-level languages such as Keras/TensorFlow, JAX and PyTorch have resulted in broad interest in deep learning methods for the tasks such as image segmentation
48
, unsupervised analysis of imaging and spectral data, and learning correlative structure-property relationships
49
.
The rise of large and multimodal electron microscopy datasets has also led to growing use of unsupervised deep learning methods to process such data
50
. There has been however, several recent exciting developments in this field. It was demonstrated last year that spectroscopic and imaging modalities need not be handled separately and can “learn” from each other to generate fused data with SNR levels beyond the reach of any current instrument
51
. Additionally, several papers have recently demonstrated that strain and structural quantification from 4D-STEM datasets can be more effectively performed with pre-trained neural networks on simulated synthetic datasets
52
,
53
,
54
. Such examples have also pushed even CTEM, the old workhorse, into new, dose-limited regimes that were not possible earlier. Similar tools now exist even in the synchrotron space, where pre-trained neural networks outperform conventional gradient descent algorithms for ptychography both in speed and data requirements
8
,
55
.
Despite the progress in instrumentation and post-acquisition data analysis, the basic principles of STEM operation have mostly stayed the same over the last several decades. In almost every case, a human scientist operates the microscope, and it is that scientist who optimizes the microscope performance, explores the sample, and selects regions for further detailed imaging or spectroscopy
56
. The realization of this limitation has led to a strong interest in active learning methods for STEM, in which an ML algorithm controls measurement pathways. Apart from this, simulations can be combined with Bayesian methods to generate idealized experimental routines for data collection, as shown for example in a recent ptychography work
57
. However, despite the strong enthusiasm, there is a growing need for the community to understand what learning can do and what constitutes an automated experiment. In brief, an automated experiment is defined by real-time analysis, which is used to alter the trajectory of experimental decisions. Here we discuss emerging developments in this domain and comment on future opportunities.
ML in microscopy
Prior to discussing active experiments, we briefly overview several emerging cases for ML in STEM. The vision for the application of ML in microscopy was developed by Bonnett and others almost 25 years ago
45
. However, the practical implementation had to wait for new computational tools and resources to become sufficiently powerful to work with large-dimensional data sets typical for imaging and hyperspectral imaging. The first practical applications of unsupervised ML methods to spectroscopic data dates back to Bosman et al.
58
.
There are many problems where it is essential to discover the underlying structure-property relationships from multimodal spectroscopic imaging modes in electron microscopy. ML techniques need to disentangle statistical spectroscopic characteristics to facilitate practical interpretations. The challenge with this task is that there is often no good way to form suitable labels. Thus, the philosophy involves learning a constrained low-rank identity function that can disentangle important features of spectroscopic response. Early methods applied linear clustering techniques to associate spectra with characteristic responses
59
. While computationally efficient, these models can only identify groups of characteristic responses and thus cannot deconvolute continuous transformations that occur at interfaces, defects, and topological structures.
Various unsupervised linear ML methods have been applied to accommodate continuous transformations of spectroscopic responses. For example, techniques such as principal component analysis, dictionary learning, and non-negative matrix factorization have been applied across multiple imaging domains
58
,
60
. These techniques are deceptively powerful. It is common for these techniques to discover statistical correlations that result in eigenvalues that match physical intuition. However, it is quite rare that the eigenvectors and reconstructions preserve spectroscopic physics. This behavior is the result of several mathematical limitations of the algorithms. First, these methods consider each data point as an independent uncorrelated dimension eliminating important spatial and temporal information. Understanding a phase or translational shift in diffraction images is out of the question. Secondly, these methods are linear, whereas spectroscopic signals and noise profiles are highly non-linear. These trends must be approximated through overparameterization, or the resulting model is usually significantly underfit. Due to the computational efficiency and ease of implementation, these methods provide an excellent starting point for ML analysis; nonetheless, it is essential that the results are rigorously validated to avoid making incorrect interpretations of underfit data
61
,
62
.
On the other side of the coin, it is possible to use unsupervised neural networks in the form of autoencoders to disentangle spectroscopic features in hyperspectral images. Autoencoders are a class of neural networks formulated to learn an identity function using three functional blocks. The first block is an encoder that tries to disentangle the statistical information from the raw data; the second block compresses this information in an embedding layer; and the final block is a decoder that takes the compressed information and reconstructs the spectra. Since autoencoders are based on neural networks, it is possible to use logical operations that consider important geometric constraints. For example, convolutions can include translational invariance, harmonic convolutions can learn rotational equivariance, recurrent neurons can consider sequential dependences, and transformers can learn attention maps.
Despite these capabilities, training robust neural networks is challenging, as they are overparameterized. Given enough neurons, autoencoders become universal identity functions capable of memorizing any observable. To make autoencoders practically valuable, it is essential to add bottleneck layers and statistical regularization mechanisms that force the model to learn a compact representation of the data, rather than just memorizing it. In turn, a variety of regularization strategies have been applied. In the first example of a regularized autoencoder for disentangling spectroscopic features in materials spectroscopy, Agar et al. applied scheduled ||L
1
|| activity regularization on a ReLu-activated embedding to disentangle sparse, non-negative characteristics of ferroelectric switching in band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy
63
. In an alternative approach, variational constraints have been included to construct variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders (VAE) add a Kullback–Leibler (KL)-divergence regularization term to the loss function:
\({KL}[N\left({\mu }_{n},{\theta }_{n}\right),N(\mathrm{0,1})]\)
. This step adds a penalty if the observed distribution in a minibatch deviates from a prior distribution – usually a Gaussian. This process allows learning a smooth latent space that is generally more interpretable.
This concept can be expanded in several ways. For example, a hyperparameter β can be included to modify the KL-divergence regularization term. When regularization scheduling is employed, this term can be used as a disentanglement metric
64
. Such regularization scheduling has been used to disentangle mechanisms of ferroelectric switching
62
. In an alternative modification, learnable geometric transformations can be learned using so-called j(r)-VAEs. These models include a spatial-transforming layer in the embedding to predict an affine transformation grid that learns the geometric orientation and transformation. This information is subsequently passed to the decoder, facilitating the disentanglement of geometric transformations from spectroscopic characteristics.
VAEs have been applied for numerous spectral and image analysis problems emerging in the context of electron and scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy. These include identification of elementary atomic building blocks and their distortion in crystalline materials
65
, analysis of rotationally invariant molecular representations in evolving graphene
66
, and semi-supervised learning of molecular shapes from the microscopic data
65
,
67
. Here, the repositories such as PyroVED (
https://github.com/ziatdinovmax/pyroVED
) contain collections of VAE including rotation- and shift-invariant networks, as well as simple, conditional, semi-supervised, and joint versions.
While these approaches have proven to be quite robust, there are justified concerns about the over reliance on machine learning models to derive physical conclusions. ML methods that include only statistical or only soft physics constraints need to be rigorously validated before any physics conclusions are derived. Conversely, this situation creates tremendous opportunities to include hard physics constraints and governing equations to restrict the output to be physics-conforming, dramatically enhancing interpretability.
In the imaging and spectroscopy domain, much work has been conducted on denoising and sparse reconstructions of images. Controlling spatio-temporal dose distribution to preserve sample integrity is a strong motivator for sparse and/or low dose acquisitions
18
. Some methods require an a priori set of sampling points, determined before an experiment, from which a full reconstruction is later derived. For example, ML based compressive sensing algorithms coupled with microscope hardware allow for collection of a random (or pseudo-random) subset of pixels in an image without sacrificing image quality
16
. Kernel based Gaussian process methods
17
estimate information sharing a priori to constrain and localize variability in high fidelity multivariate reconstructions. These methods use a statically chosen set of sampling points before an experiment is started, but there are also existing methods for utilizing on-the-fly information (points updated during experiments) in AE, which will be discussed later.
Another broad set of problems involves analyzing images to identify the objects of interest, including localization and characteristics. Many of these problems, including atomic identification, have been extensively explored well before the emergence of deep ML. However, the emergence of the deep DCNNs (deep convolutional neural networks) has made this problem almost routine
48
,
68
. We note that these semantic segmentation methods are supervised in nature, meaning the algorithm is trained on the human-labeled data and is subsequently applied to a much larger data set.
Visual feedback is a necessary part of image analysis, both when training a ML model and interpreting its results. Values such as accuracy and uncertainty can be calculated to determine the trustworthiness of a model’s results, but often the best and most meaningful evaluation comes from seeing the model’s results overlayed on top of – or displayed next to the original image. This comparison allows a microscopist to easily see where the model agrees or differs with their expectations, and to interpret and explain results. This type of feedback is also important during the design and training of a ML model. Microscopy images vary significantly between material systems and even within a single material due to noise, imaging artifacts, and beam-induced changes; thus, image acquisition parameters can have a powerful effect on the resulting image. It follows that the preprocessing steps and ML models that produce good results on one image may not translate well to another set of images, making visual feedback throughout the process of designing or tuning a model essential. Some models overcome this barrier and can generalize to multiple material systems by demanding a minimum amount of information about image(s) each time the model is run
20
,
21
. Providing this information to a model using a command-line interface might not be intuitive to users who would benefit from applying such a model to their own data. A graphical user interface (GUI) designed to guide users through the process of selecting an image, preprocessing it, training the model, and interpreting the results greatly improves the accessibility of ML models to microscopists
69
.
The type of user interface needed for a model depends on the intended users. A microscopist may prefer to interface with an existing ML model through a polished GUI such as a web app that guides them smoothly through applying it to their data
69
. One such web app – pyCHIP – allows users to select model parameters that fit their image’s feature size by adjusting a slider bar which dynamically updates a grid overlaid on their image. PyCHIP also simplifies the selection of ‘support sets’ for a few-shot ML model by allowing users to click on regions of the image containing interesting features and adding custom labels
69
. This kind of interface works well for someone looking to apply a model as-is to their dataset. A data scientist on the other hand may appreciate a more dynamic relationship with the model such as through a Jupyter Notebook, allowing them to look under the hood and modify model parameters as needed to tune it to their dataset. The Pycroscopy Python package for example, provides Jupyter notebooks containing well documented code and instructions for utilizing its ML models in different ways
70
. Both web app GUIs and Jupyter Notebook UIs aid in the interpretability and accessibility of ML models for microscopy applications.
The early successes in post-acquisition image and spectroscopy analysis in STEM have naturally generated much excitement in extending these methods towards the real-time data analytics and subsequently automated experiments. In the latter case, the real-time data analysis is used as a basis for a real-time decision making, e.g., choosing the sequence of measurement points for EELS measurements or finetuning the microscope parameters for different parts of the sample.
However, the transition to automated experimentation has proven to be a considerably more complex problem then initially anticipated. First, during an active experiment, the data becomes available sequentially—a very different situation from the static data sets typically used in classical ML methods. Secondly, the microscope performance changes during operation and especially between the subsequent experiments. Consequently, a neural network trained on one day will perform much worse on subsequent days—the celebrated out of distribution drift effect. Third, and less recognized until now, is the workflow planning process. In other words, a human operator performs the sequence of operations following a specific, implicit, or explicit goal. In certain cases, it is obvious (e.g., when we tune the microscope, we aim to improve the resolution), but it is often not trivial to explain a workflow, such as the process of discovery. Hence, a key part of defining automated experiment workflows is the reward, which we next discuss.
Automated experiments: control, algorithms and reward
Discussion of automated experimentation requires explicit analysis of three dissimilar components. The first and obvious component is the engineering controls: the microscope control and command language that determines what operations can be performed and initiated from the external control electronics. The second component is the ML algorithm: that code analyzes the data streaming from the instrument, reduces the data, and generates a sequence of commands returned to the microscope. Third and, often overlooked, is the reward—the perceived goal of the experiment. Given a list of possible operations, an experiment targeting different specific goals will follow different experimental paths. For example, exploring the same sample of the oxide film will lead the scientist to different regions if interested in electrocatalytic activity on the surface vs. magnetoresistive phenomena dominated by the interfaces. Below, we discuss these three elements in more detail.
Engineering controls: Engineering controls currently strongly hinge on the availability of the manufacturer-provided application programming interfaces (APIs) for instrumental control. For example, early work on the electron beam material sculpting
71
, direct beam writing
72
, atomic manipulation
73
, and non-rectangular scans
74
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relied on the custom modifications of microscope electronics and home built controls. The introduction of the improved version of the Nion SWIFT API in the summer of 2021 have permitted unparalleled access to multiple instrument components, including the illumination system, stage, projection system, and detectors and has made these experiments almost straightforward
75
.
Recent approaches based on low-level Python APIs in JEOL microscopes have also achieved task automation for materials focused electron microscopy
76
,
77
,
78
,
79
,
80
. In the AutoEM system developed by Olszta et al., centralized control is based on asynchronous communication protocols that allow for variable timing between instrument control (action) and instrument readout (reaction), which is essential to account for latencies in both data collection and analysis
78
. Importantly, such latencies can vary depending on the nature of the experiment itself. For instance, in large area statistical montaging, data collection is the bottleneck since it is limited by the speed of mechanical motion (~0.1 fps images), while data analysis via few-shot ML-based classification is fast (~100 fps images). In other cases, such as high-speed in situ experimentation, data collection may fast (1-10k fps images) but a similar data analysis then becomes the bottleneck. In the latter case, only a subset of frames can be processed, limiting the ability to make decisions on rapidly changing phenomena. Here it becomes desirable to have interchangeable models, which a modular system like the AutoEM controller allows. Descriptive models are useful for scenarios where the goal is to identify, describe, and relate features, such as crystal phases, defects, or particles
81
,
82
.
However, we increasingly require predictive models that can forecast the future state of a chemical or material system for anticipatory control of long-latency instrument parameters. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successful in forecasting for other domains facing similar problems. Long short-term memory models (LSTMs), a type of RNN, have recently been applied to in situ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
83
. The new model, called EELSTM, inputs a series of prior spectra, such as the initial stages of a chemical reaction, and forecast the future time state of the reaction. They can then be implemented on-the-fly and used to direct an experiment, compensating for long-latency instrument or sample reactions. This area is largely unexplored and presents a tremendous opportunity for more intelligent and impactful automated experimentation.
Algorithms
:
The second key element of automated experimentation is the algorithm, whether machine learning or simple image analysis. Generally, the algorithm has access to the data generated by the microscope at certain level of aggregation, e.g. direct data flow from the detectors or data aggregated at the level of individual images, spectra, or hyperspectral data sets. The algorithms perform certain transformation of the data and return the control signals to the microscope. It is important to note these algorithms can vary in complexity from elementary edge filters or Fourier transforms to complex deep convolutional networks. The choice of the algorithm is determined by the specific task to be accomplished, dimensionality and property of parameter space in which it operates, variability of the data, and by the availability of the compute capabilities and required latencies.
Rewards: Finally, the key and often unrecognized element of the automated experiment is the reward. This is a new element that appears in active learning and more generally stochastic optimization problems, and generally represents the goal of the experiment. Often, the reward function is understood implicitly. For example, tuning the microscope necessitates reducing the effective probe size and minimizing asymmetries. In case when the reward function is well understood and can be readily determined from the data, the problem can be conveniently cast as the optimization over a certain parameter space, for example via Bayesian optimization
57
.
In general, reward functions for imaging and spectroscopy experiments can be very non-trivial and are closely aligned with the goal of the experiments. For example, when exploring ferroelectric oxide thin films, the experimentalist may be mainly interested in the formation of dislocations and presence of second phase inclusions in the material, properties of the topological defects, evolution of the electronic and phononic properties at structural or topological defects, and many other aspects of material behavior. The sequence of actions taken by the experimentalist will depend on this perceived reward, and the experiment will balance the exploration and exploitation component. Here, exploration generally refers to the overview of the structural elements present in the material, whereas exploitation refers to the experimental measurements on specific elements that are a priori known to be of interest. The reward function can also change during the experiment. For example, an initial reward function is often calibration and optimization of the imaging conditions, performed using the standard (or well known) sample. Secondly the exploration often aims to ascertain the statistically significant features of the sample and identify outliers (defects, dislocations, etc.). After that, an experimental workflow can be driven by the exploration of objects known to be of interest, or driven by operator curiosity. These considerations necessarily must be considered for the ideation and orchestration of automated experimentation, as will be discussed below.
On the fly analysis: reconstruction and segmentation
The first step in automated experimentation is real-time analysis of a data stream from the microscope detectors. This analysis can include denoising and interpolation to improve human operator perception, as well as more complex operations, such as semantic segmentation and feature discovery (e.g. finding atoms on sparse images). This semantically segmented data can inform human operator decisions, or subsequently used to autonomous experiments.
For pre-acquired data sets, these analyses can be performed via a broad variety of ML algorithms including compressed sensing, Gaussian processes, or supervised learning. The mathematics behind many of these methods is fairly complex and will not be discussed here. However, the development of open code ecosystem renders them easy to implement once the Python plug-ins for the instrument are available. It is important to note that for any algorithm it is vital to establish the balance between the data and the prior knowledge in some form. For example, compressive sensing and simple Gaussian Processes are purely data driven strategies that seek to interpolate and denoise the data under some general requirements on the smoothness of the image. At the same time, pre-trained neural networks will remember the significant features of their training data, potentially leading to contamination of the processed data, as humorously illustrated in the generative approaches shown in Fig.
1
.

.
The generative network allows to transform horse into zebra. However, it also attempts to perform similar operation with humans.
Full size image
For active learning on microscope these issues are amplified. By definition, information only becomes sequentially available during such an experiment. For unsupervised learning problems, this creates an obvious problem of the analysis of increasing data set at each step, with the interpretation of emerging components changing over acquisition time. For supervised ML problems based on a pretrained model, a key issue becomes out of distribution drift. In other words, the neural network trained for one state of the imaging system will start to fail for different parameter setting.
A typical automated experiment (AE)
79
on the microscope should be capable of performing (a) accurate semantic or chip-level segmentation on images to recognize and extract information on atoms or other relevant features, followed by (b) discovering relationships between beam control parameters and how those affect structure-property relationships of the material under investigation. The final goal is to find out a roadmap, assisted by theory, to obtain target structure by atomic manipulation with the least possible human intervention.
ML/deep learning methods become the obvious choice to accomplish the first task since their applications have proven to be successful at feature detection in many fields such as computer vision, biology, and medicine, as already discussed. These networks tend to work reasonably well on the datasets with large sample sizes, with large variabilities belonging to each category. However, datasets consisting atomically resolved STEM or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, the features such as atoms, defects are almost identical (periodic). Changes in imaging conditions on same material system give rise to a different set of data distribution. As a result, one network yielding reasonably accurate prediction may give suboptimal performance on a dataset coming from another set of experimental parameters due to out-of-distribution drift. In addition, deep networks trained on a cumulative dataset with instances from multiple experimental, or simulation conditions are not always sufficient to recognize subtle distinctions in atomic features. Retraining networks by varying hyperparameters every time is also time and resource consuming, limiting its applicability within an AE environment. Therefore, to accomplish the task of feature recognition during a live experiment, the network must adapt to changes to the imaging conditions and successfully locate features while quantifying associated uncertainties to make the analyses efficient and accurate.
In our recent work, we have demonstrated how an ensemble learning
84
iterative training (ELIT) workflow
85
can be employed to overcome some of these challenges. Within the ensemble learning (EL) part of the workflow, each new model is trained with different random initialization of weights and random shuffling of training data, with a stochastic weight averaging (SWA) procedure. At the end of training, the model averages over multiple points along the trajectory of stochastic gradient descent. The examples on the static datasets on graphene and NiO-LSMO further show how EL is capable to select of artifact-free features and pixel-wise uncertainty maps by combining multiple networks. Switching from image-specific to materials-specific descriptors and training networks on the first frame of images obtained at the initial stages of the experiment can help to account for out-of-distribution effects and improve model performance. Once an initial prediction is obtained, the network is retrained iteratively to realize all features by focusing its attention on features present in the (heavily degenerate) data. It increases the feature detection limit of the network.
Pre-trained ELIT models provide a good start to establish this workflow during a real-time AE. Here, initial training datasets do not necessarily have to come from experiments. These datasets can be obtained by performing first-principles simulations (e.g., density functional theory (DFT), ab initio DFT, molecular dynamics (MD)) on the same material system. The models trained on such accurate simulated data may not account for experimental noise or nonidealities. Hence, these generally fail to approximate features from the experimental data. However, simulated datasets must be carefully augmented to include possible data transformations to minimize the differences between the simulated and experimental structures. Possible augmentations include addition of random zoom-ins, rotations, contrast scaling, and noise. Once the datasets are prepared, ELIT models are trained. During an AE as shown in our recent work
86
, we can utilize the pre-trained ELIT models to detect features from a live data stream by iteratively training the models to analyze local atomic environments, with the possibility of using detector feedback to guide beam conditions such as dwell time.
To successfully assist the next set of experiments and discover structure-property relationships, one must also infuse the fundamental theoretical understanding within the AE loop. The last decades have seen a tremendous growth in the field computational physics, materials science, and related areas, due to significant advancements in computational capabilities including accessible central processing units (CPUs)/graphical processing units (GPUs), efficient algorithms. Performing physical simulations from the atomistic scale using first-principles techniques to mesoscale/finite scale using quantum Monte Carlo and finite-element methods are all within our reach. As expected, the surge of data that gets generated via these simulations also comes with a wealth of knowledge on thermodynamic, electronic, magnetic properties of materials and physical/chemical phenomenon.
However, a strong disparity still exists between the time, length scale, and associated latencies of running an experiment (e.g., generating one image frame using electron microscope takes fraction of a second) and execution of simulation (e.g., performing geometry optimization on a system in Å to nanometer scales and estimating physical properties take multiple CPU hours). Hence, integration of theory into AE is non-trivial and requires developments of smart approaches
87
,
88
,
89
,
90
to enable on-the-fly synchronized learning from the experimental observations and simulations. In our recent work
91
, we have established a workflow that employs deep neural networks to identify atomic features (type and position), followed by constructing simulation objects in an automated fashion to directly pipe those into DFT and MD simulations environment. Here, various image patches and corresponding simulation objects are chosen by the human expert in the loop to decide the structure fragments from the entire image perspective, suitable to perform simulations. For e.g., segments of graphene that has maintained its ideal coordination after few seconds under the electron beam, may not be the most interesting to investigate compared to regions where it has already begun to form defects. Similarly, it becomes more likely for a successful transition-metal adsorption to take place or dynamic reconstruction of ring arrangements if the regions with symmetry or bond breaking are explored. In addition, performing simulations on the smaller counterparts, as opposed to the entire large-scale system, also help to match the disparity in the time and length scales, while helping to approximate the overall evolution of the material.
While this workflow is already in place and has led to successful results, it also opens new avenues for exploring structure fragments
92
,
93
,
94
in a broader possible way, which can act as proxies to conduct theoretical investigations during an AE. Moreover, these proxies could be unique in nature that directly relate to the features as recognized by the deep networks to fundamental causal mechanisms. It is established
95
,
96
,
97
,
98
that experimental variables can be directly related to properties such as microscopic polarization or lattice parameters. But to determine how these can be controlled, we can incorporate insights from structural distortions connecting to the electronic degrees of freedom, that ultimately control most functionalities
99
,
100
,
101
,
102
such as phase transitions, electronic properties (e.g., linear magnetoelectricity, ferromagnetism and polarization and metal-to-insulator transition in transition metal oxides) in solids. Here, these can be exploited as theoretical proxies to establish underlying causal mechanisms
103
to further elucidate the physics involved for assisting next set of measurements.
Direct experiments
The real time analytics of the STEM data stream further opens the pathway for the implementation of automated experimentation, meaning real-time decision making by the automated agent. During an experiment the human operator typically goes through multiple steps of tuning, selection of region of interest, exploration at different resolution, and spectroscopic measurements. Correspondingly, it makes sense to explore the actions performed by the ML agent in the context of human operation. Following the terminology accepted in active learning community, we refer to the decision-making process adopted by ML agent, i.e. selection of actions based on the state of the system, as
policy
. The simplest form of an automated experiment is based on predefined policies, which we have previously termed an ‘open loop’ experiment
74
. In this case, the (pre trained) ML algorithm is used to identify the objects of interest, and predefined sequence of action is taken dependent on observation. We note that in most cases of human-driven experiment the policies are also predetermined (albeit can be very complex), since analysis of the data is usually performed after the experiment and human learning (that will affect policies) typically happens much slower than a single experiment.
A typical example of such experimental measurements uses the real-time analysis of the imaging data stream to identify the a priori known objects of interest, such as specific defect configurations, extended defects, or edges. For example, one of the most common materials science studies is the ‘needle in the haystack’ search. In this study, it is necessary to be able to both acquire large volumes of representative data—a classic challenge for highly local electron microscopy—and detect features of interest with human-like reasoning. The aforementioned AutoEM system is one example of such a platform that can acquire data repeatably and at scale in an ‘open loop’ experiment. Data can subsequently be triaged using a few-shot or other ML approach to target desired features of interest. The instrument can then move to those objects, change magnification, select new imaging parameters, etc., constituting a ‘closed loop’ experiment with rich statistical information, as shown in Fig.
2
. Here the challenge is not simply object detection, but rather the movement of the stage and on-the-fly tuning, which is often quite imprecise and prone to error
54
,
104
. Costly and time-consuming registration and image correction routines must be applied to achieve the desired precision for the many hundreds or thousands of acquisitions that might be executed in a typical experiment
105
,
106
,
107
,
108
. There is an important opportunity to improve stage hardware, alignment stability, and overall timing to facilitate emerging automated experimentation

A similar approach can be applied for the electron-beam modification experiments. In this case, the real time analysis of the STEM data stream can be used to identify objects of interest such as specific atomic configurations. Figure

shows the conversion of live ADF data into classified atomic groups using neural networks within the ensemble learning iterative training (ELIT) scheme
85
, where the computations are performed either on an edge computing device, a connected multi-GPU workstation, or even directly on the instrument machine itself. This approach was used to realize controlled experiments where atomic precision of the electron beam relative to specific atomic groups is required – for instance, targeting and ejecting selected S atoms in MoS

86
. Direct fabrication of atomic devices can be accomplished in this way, as shown in Fig.
3
with the placement of single (sulfur) vacancy lines in MoS
2
. We note that in this case the modification policies were also defined prior to the experiment (‘open loop’).

Indirect experiments and DKL experiments
A more complex task in the context of imaging-spectroscopy is the inverse experiment, where the goal is to discover the structural elements that exhibit a specific spectroscopic feature. We note that in this case the aspect of interest is defined before the experiment (i.e., the policy is fixed), and is assumed to be reduced to one (or several) aspects. For example, for a given EELS spectrum, the aspects of interest can be either peak structure, area under specific peaks, or even pre-trained neural network, as is the case in the EELSTM model
79
. Aspects of interest are typically scalar quantities; therefore, a spectrum may be ‘scalarized’ into such an aspect by operating on the spectrum in a defined manner. Scalarizing the spectrum in a specific manner allows physics to enter the workflow, which is decided by the user, i.e., the ‘human-in-the-loop.’ If a spectrum is acquired from within a parent structural image, a relationship can begin to be built between the local structural information from where the spectrum was acquired and an aspect of interest of the spectrum. A similar argument can be made for how a human operator uses their expertise to decide from where they should acquire high-cost measurements, given an observation of a structural space.
These relationships can be discovered autonomously with even only a handful of structure-property pairs on-the-fly and with no prior training, in what is known as deep kernel learning (DKL). When equipped with such structure-property relationships, this approach allows temporally expensive or high dose measurements to be performed in an intelligent manner. In this way, DKL falls within the category of active learning. This of course has implications for beam-sensitive specimens, but also, it crucially allows exploration of the sample space much more significantly, and the exploration itself is determined by the specified “scalarizer” at the start of the experiment. This design means that depending on the scalarizer, different structure-property relationships are learned by the model, and therefore different regions in space will be probed based on that selection. DKL is not limited to EELS
109
, but virtually any multidimensional signal can be used, such as diffraction data in 4D-STEM
54
. How the DKL model learns can be visualized by their exploration pathway (order of acquiring data points). DKL operates by leveraging a deep neural network to embed local structural descriptors (image patches centered at the measurement position) to a low dimensional latent space, where a gaussian process (GP) kernel operates to reconstruct the full data given the acquired data. DKL experiments for both EELS and 4D-STEM (diffraction data), in addition to the impact of choosing different scalarizers, are shown in Fig.
4
.

, where two different scalarizers reveal different exploration pathways (shown as red dots) – peak ratio and peak maximums within specified spectral bands were used to incorporate physics into the model. DKL operating on diffraction data is shown in
c
, where a convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern is reduced into the center of mass (CoM), and the magnitude of the CoM and direction of the CoM are used as scalarizers to guide the automated experiment. In both EELS and 4D-STEM versions of DKL, the choice of scalarizer clearly impacts the exploration pathway as well as the structure-property relationship learned.

For this scheme to be possible on an instrument in real time, there must be access to both the structural image data and the measurement data (EELS, diffraction pattern, etc.). Positioning of the electron beam and readout of the detector signal must also be possible. We note that in many (traditional) systems, the EELS detector operates on a separate machine entirely, making this type of experiment extremely challenging or not possible. The DKL algorithms were implemented on the Nion instruments, where these requirements are easily satisfied
via
access to the scan controller, all detectors, and practically all low-level hardware components through the Nion Swift API
71
. No external hardware is needed, aside from a possible connection to a GPU or multi-GPU workstation for faster model training. While API-level control is not an absolute requirement, it is extremely useful, particularly for complex experiments which are difficult in advance to know what controls are needed. Further, more microscope manufacturers appear to be trending toward increased control of their systems, for example, with JEOL’s PyJEM Python package

From two to many: building characterization workflows
As discussed above, the operation of the microscope typically involves multiple operator-initiated steps including initial tuning and overview scans and identification of initial objects of interest, as illustrated in Fig.
5
. With these, the imaging, tuning, and spectroscopic cases can be repeated multiple times during the experiment. We note that while this process is familiar to any microscopist, there are several specific aspects that should be enumerated explicitly.
Fig. 5: Workflow analysis during a STEM-EELS experiment.
After the initial tuning, the operator selects the region of interest and performs multiple zoom-in and zoom out stages, retuning, and selection of locations for the spectroscopic studies. This sequence of actions can be represented as a workflow, i.e. sequence of microscope operations performed by the human. The operations implemented by human implicitly define the hyper-language used by the microscope. The workflow design via ML agent is essentially reinforcement learning problem targeting the specific reward via sequence of actions possible within the language.
Full size image
The first specific aspect is the hyper-language, i.e. the sequence of operations and associated parameters that the human operator can execute. Despite differences among microscopes from different manufacturers and between microscopes of different types (STEM, SEM, SPM), the hyper-languages for many of these systems will be essentially identical and should evolve on the convergent paths between different communities. A second key aspect is the workflow, defined here as the sequence of steps performed by the human operator using the available hyper-language. The third component is the reward – meaning the perceived goal of the experiment. We note that while reward is a very familiar concept for scientists in the fields such as stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning, the definition of the reward function in scientific experiment is highly non-trivial and domain dependent. For example, for traditional ML problems such as autonomous driving the reward function is defined as getting from point A to point B in the least time without crashes. Services such as Google Maps provide the preferred path, reducing the problem to driving.
Comparatively, the reward in scientific experimentation is often a very complex function determined by the prior knowledge and perceived goal of the experiment. The reward can combine the elements of curiosity and general discovery, falsification of hypothesis, or quantitative measurements. For example, it is common to explore new material system in the pure discovery mode, i.e. elucidating the observable structures and morphologies. The more detailed studies can be informed by the prior hypotheses, for example establish the presence of specific structural elements that can account for the macroscopic behaviors. Finally, the experiment can be motivated by the quantitative measurements, e.g. establish the structure of the polarization distribution across the specific ferroelectric domain wall or the strain field around the dislocation.
Following the comparison with the stochastic optimization community, we introduce the concept of a policy guiding the experiment. Generally, in RL a community policy defines the deterministic or probabilistic action taken given the (observed) state of the system. Correspondingly, the policy in the human-driven experiment implicitly defines the selection of the actions by the operator. This process includes elements well established in the RL community, including the exploration and exploitation. The former is exploring the image plane for object of interest. This process can be random, or driven by curiosity, outlier detection, etc. The latter is exploitation, including discovery of specific microstructural elements, hypothesis falsification, or quantitative measurements. While it is difficult to generalize, we argue that the policies used by the human operator will change only weakly during the experiment. For example, depending on the observations the operator can choose a different reward function (i.e. explore the dislocations rather than second phase inclusions), but is unlikely to update the knowledge base during the experiment. These characteristics suggest that workflow planning in the automated experiment can be treated similarly to the RL problem, where the reward function is defined prior to the experiment and workflow development includes updating the policies that define the microscope operation possible within the hyper-language commands for a given system.
Real-time local decision making
One of the principal challenges with deploying ML models is making them practically relevant to the experiment and the scientist. Depending on the experiment, these practical requirements could be vastly different. Thus, it is essential to consider the design of the experiment, algorithms, infrastructure, and hardware when designing real-time analysis for automated experiments in electron microscopy. The primary constraint is that the analysis must happen on a time scale relevant to the experiment. This could mean that the analysis needs to happen in hours to minutes to provide the experimentalist insight to guide the following experiment. If trying to guide active learning and autonomous experiments, the analysis should happen commensurate with the experimental collection speed, usually in minutes to seconds. Finally, it could be required that ML be used for real-time controls and triggering that requires millisecond to nanosecond latencies.
Advances in computational resources have made achieving real-time hours-to-minute analysis possible. Excluding fringe cases limited by high-velocity data, many empirical models can be reasonably approximated using neural networks. These processes are simple to implement at scale since they are embarrassingly parallel. Achieving the desired throughput merely requires purchasing and co-locating the correct number of GPUs. When a pre-trained model exists, most electron microscopy experiments can be analyzed in minutes on a local GPU-accelerated workstation.
The implementation of the active learning and automated experiments on STEM necessarily brings forth the consideration of the available computation power, data storage, and data transfer. This can be performed both at the local level and via the integration with distributed cloud resources (and potentially other microscopes). In the former case, data analytics and decision making are performed locally on the computational tools collocated with the microscope. In the second case, the microscope, potentially with some form of point of generation data compression, is integrated with the large-scale cloud resource.
However, achieving real-time analysis can be challenging if a model needs to be trained or fine-tuned for a specific experiment. Model development typically requires hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal parameters to train a model to the specific statistical distributions of the training dataset. Hyperparameter search is generally done using brute force techniques or using e.g., hyperparameter optimization software or architecture tuning tools, each requiring many GPU hours. It is still an open challenge to provide burstable GPU access to experimentalists to train large-scale ML models rapidly. Alternatively, it is possible to reduce the computational complexity of the model and training process. Most ML tasks barely consider computational complexity or optimization speed, as providing more computing resources and computational time is comparatively easy. In turn, most machine learning algorithms are overparameterized and over-precise (in terms of bit-depth). The result is flat loss landscapes that are easy to optimize using simple momentum-based stochastic gradient descent optimizers like stochastic gradient descent. Such first-order optimizers sacrifice performance and efficiency for computational simplicity. When optimization speed becomes critical, more advanced optimizers are required. One approach is to use quasi-second-order optimization methods that approximate the Hessian. These methods are inherently more computationally complex but result in significantly better optimization steps, particularly on highly regularized models. Moving beyond first-order optimizers is necessary to achieve real-time electron microscopy analysis.
When trying to automate experiments in minutes to seconds, the primary limitation is established by infrastructural challenges associated with stable and high-speed networking and the high availability of computing resources. The distributed nature of scientific instrumentation makes it uncommon to have networking >1 Gbps at microscopes. Upgrading networking infrastructure requires a reconceptualization of network topologies which tend to bear high costs. In turn, administrators are slow to make high-speed networking (>10 Gbps) available. In an ideal scenario, this limits data velocities to <100 MB/s. In practice, many layers of complexity render connecting scientific instruments to centralized computing impractical. Additional latencies appear from competing network traffic, data ingestion at parallel file systems, and transfer to computing resources. Furthermore, typical job scheduler management systems used in HPC facilities are antithetical to electron microscopy, which requires immediate computational availability when experiments are ready. The solution is to analyze the edge by leveraging technologies such as remote direct memory access; data transferred over networks can be transferred directly to the GPU over the peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) bus without CPU involvement and thus minimal latency.
Everything becomes more complicated when analyzing real-time controls and triggering that requires inference with <ms-to-nanosecond latencies. General-purpose hardware such as CPUs and GPUs cannot be used as an instruction process, and input/output (I/O) imparts latency commensurate with scientific experiments. The only viable solution is to directly deploy machine learning models on the extreme edge in programmable logic. The convergence of researchers with knowledge of electron microscopy, machine learning approaches, and programmable logic is currently not well addressed. When deploying machine learning on programmable logic, there are tradeoffs between model performance, computational operations, and hardware resources that must be carefully considered to meet the required figures of merit for an application. This must be achieved through codesign. Recently, several developments have assisted in machine learning codesign on the extreme edge. Packages including Brevitas and QKeras make simpler compressed machine learning models using quantized-aware training. The optimization of these models is assisted by second-order optimizers such as a HAWQ specifically designed for quantization.
Similarly, the design cycles to deploy models on programmable logic (e.g., field-programmable gate arrays [FPGAs]) and application-specific integrated circuits have been facilitated by tools such as HLS4ML

, PyTorch

, and Onnx to HLS (high-level synthesis) that can be synthesized into internet protocol (IP)-blocks. These frameworks provide a simple abstraction that allows tuning tradeoffs between model complexity, resource utilization, and latency. Developing the physical and cyberinfrastructure to simplify edge ML in electron microscopy offers tremendous opportunities for growth and could enable entirely new imaging modes and complex atomic-scale manufacturing.
Microscope as a part of distributed system
With these considerations in mind, we can design a STEM ecosystem needed to support remote autonomous experiments employing edge computing and storage systems, as shown in Fig.
6
:
Local and remote access: Microscopes are manually operated using custom software installed on control computers co-located with instruments, which are typically connected only to local hub networks. The network access from remote computing nodes is established to both their hardware and software which are protected by access controls and firewalls.
Operation system (OS) and software: Microscope software is typically proprietary and runs on Windows OS, and the measurements are stored on the local computer, and the storage systems often use custom mechanisms and formats. Both control and data access from remote Linux servers may be required, which entails interfacing different OSs, including programming environments, file and data formats, remote file mounts and host firewalls and access mechanisms. For example, in ecosystem shown in Fig.
1
, files on Windows based network attached storage (NAS) are mounted on remote Linux systems using cifs and sshfs.
Networking: Network connections to control computers carry both measurements and control traffic, typically, over the same IP path and network interfaces. Over long network connections, this non-separation can potentially lead to the loss of instrument control when large measurement transfers occupy the entire available bandwidth. Suitable end-to-end network channels and mechanisms are provisioned between the microscope control computers and remote servers.

based on separate end-to-end channels for control and data that are serviced by software modules that communicate across Windows and Linux OS. The control channels enable the scientists and automated codes to remotely access the microscope control computer and execute steering commands. The microscope measurements are collected on the NAS and made available on remote computing systems. In addition, a management plane is utilized by the science users and administrators to manage microscope, systems, NAS from the control node.

shows this design for ORNL ecosystem for the microscope infrastructure. A Nion microscope with an attached applicability statement 2 (AS2) controller is controlled by the instrumentation control computer running Swift software. Upon the completion of a manual or remote command, the measurements from the microscope are transferred and stored on NAS, which is configured to export its file system, thereby making it available for analyses codes that utilize powerful remote computing systems such as servers with multiple GPUs. A control channel is used to remotely access the instrument control computer for sending control commands and parameters to steer the microscope experiments. Upon command execution, the control computer may send back the results or other data. Pyro client-server codes are developed

to support remote steering of microscope experiments across the ecosystem. Pyro provides a Python API for network access and is installed it on the control computer’s Swift virtual environment and on the remote computing systems. The computing capabilities of remote computing systems, namely, DGX1 with 8 GPUs and Linux server with 2 GPUs, are integrated into this ecosystem, and same approach is applicable to high performance computing (HPC) systems which typically are Linux based.
The alternative PNNL ecosystem design is shown in Fig.

, utilizing a universal JEOL-based platform running the pyJEM API. The system integrates low-level API commands with an asynchronous, centralized controller that networks all aspects of the instrument and facilitates on-the-fly machine reasoning using sparse data analytics and other ML models. The system abstracts direct control of illumination, stage, and detectors, permitting highly reproducible, standardized experimentation. Importantly, it can rapidly incorporate new analytic models and harness on-premises edge computing hardware, including an NVidia Jetson AGX Xavier-based supercomputing system, for real-time classification, segmentation, and denoising of data. The system is interlinked with PNNL’s DataHub lab-level data architecture, permitting automated curation of data and recall for subsequent priming of experimentation. The instrument can be operated in both ‘open-loop’ and ‘closed-loop’ modes and observed remotely via a secure terminal connection. A key advantage of this architecture is that the underlying controller and analytics can be deployed on any JEOL hardware system, enabling rich automated experimentation for a broad set of the microscopy community.

Data infrastructure for shared instrument cloud and automated microscopy
New powerful experimental microscopy instruments that are capable of generating 100 s of TB/day are being built. Simultaneously, a new generation of powerful computational resources including e.g., Exascale systems at DOE Leadership Computing Facilities and on-demand cloud computing resources (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, NSF Jetstream) while new automation software and services are available to researchers. Thus, there exists an opportunity to weave these varied experimental and computational resources into a cohesive distributed data infrastructure composed of software, services, and resources that facilitate data transfer and movement, advanced computing, flexible policy definition and execution, reusable and shared data, models, and workflows. With such an infrastructure, it will be possible to realize ML-guided real-time analysis and feedback-based microscope operation and to build a connected cloud of instruments vastly increasing the efficiency of instruments and potentially enabling new modes of discovery. We share here key aspects of the enabling distributed data infrastructure followed by an aspirational example of an ML-guided near real-time STEM experiment.
We envision the development of a shared data infrastructure to allow scientists at any networked facility to share data, workflows, and models, instantly accessing the best performing AI algorithms for image analysis from the model repositories and reusing data collected from many instruments from data repositories to enabling an optimized research process. Here, we discuss some of the key data infrastructure components of the instrument cloud.
Workflow Repository and Orchestration: A set of instrument cloud capabilities are abilities to define, orchestrate, share, and reuse workflows. For example, researchers may define workflows, comprised of steps, that coordinate and orchestrate simple and complex actions - perhaps conditional on the results of previous steps or other state. Such actions may include: 1) specifying where and when data should be replicated to locations where processing occurs; 2) defining which functions are applied to data for processing; 3) depositing data and metadata in a shared data repository at the end of the experiment; 4) triggering actions conditional on workflow state, and much more (e.g. Exaworks
/
Automate/Gladier).
Data Collection and Movement: A core component needed to realize a distributed data infrastructure is the software-defined movement of data between heterogenous systems. These software and services should allow data to be moved, as needed, reliably and seamlessly between e.g., the systems where data are collected, cloud storage, and eventually repositories where the data are made available to the community (e.g. Globus).
Flexible Computing: Microscopy workloads may necessitate computation on a continuum of systems ranging from laptops, cloud, GPU clusters, all the way to Exascale system. Microscopy workflows may require regular retraining of ML models, on-demand model inference, data cleaning and processing, and more (e.g. Parsl, FuncX).
Data Repository: The instrument cloud should have access to repositories of previously collected data, potentially shared across many institutions. These repositories should enable search for existing data, or read and write of data and metadata with defined data structures and metadata schemas. The repository acts to provide 1) raw or processed data for the training of models to guide future experiments, 2) metadata to allow users or agents to search and discover what data are already available and what experiments have been conducted, and 3) a place to share data with the wider community (e.g. materials data facility [MDF]/Foundry).
Model Repository: The instrument cloud should also have access to similarly read, write, and search for and shared models. For example a model repository could contain 1) the latest and versions of models trained and used as part to track provenance; and 2) provide to simplify inference with registered models.
Finally, we define an aspirational ML-guided automated STEM experiment flow that leverages the instrument cloud capabilities described above. In this scenario, shown in Fig.
8
, data are collected at a high-powered microscope at ORNL or PNNL that generates data at rates too fast to process with local compute resources. Instead, the data are moved to a processing facility, (e.g., at the nearby Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) or PNNL’s Constance / Deception Supercomputer). Upon data generation, a script automatically begins streaming the data to the OLCF system for processing. Processed data and metadata are added to a central repository that may also connect data from external resources. At the same time, a policy is defined that automatically initiates the GPU-heavy workload of model retraining upon collection of a new dataset for a specific material. The new model(s) are stored in a model repository that may also access external models. Finally, the trained model and weights are sent back to the data collection for inference using a local GPU. Critical to this flow is seamless and automated data and metadata collection, data registration in a repository, flexible computing, a policy engine to define where and when various compute happens. Similar examples have been developed for common workflows at beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source for processing at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility for near real-time feedback (e.g. Gladier).
Fig. 8: An example workflow built using distributed data infrastructure to enable an AI-guided microscopy experiment.
This general flow encompasses (1) automated data collection at the microscope, and movement of these data to a processing location; (2) registration of these data in a data repository; (3) periodic or policy-driven retraining of models on data collected in the data repository; (4) registration and versioning of the newest model in a model repository and (5) movement of the model back to the data collection location or inference from a cloud service. External data, metadata and models allow for sharing across workflows.

Towards the future
Scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy has become one of the foundational tools in modern materials science, condensed matter physics, chemistry, and biology. The impact of this technique is directly related to the amounts of quantifiable information on materials structure and properties it can derive. The success of fields such as Cryo EM and small crystal electron crystallography suggest that the availability of the data analysis methods and operational workflows greatly amplifies the value derived from technique developments and suggests tremendous potential for the field growth.
One of the rapidly emerging trends in STEM is the development of the automated experiments. Here, we overview some of the challenges that transition from human-driven to automated experiment EM will bring. On the instrument side, this necessitates the development of the instrument-level hyper-languages that allow to represent the human operations via minimal primitives. On the ML side, it requires development of the supervised ML algorithms that are stable with respect to the out of distribution drift effects and active learning methods that can be trained on small volumes of data. On the computational and network side, it requires development of edge computing infrastructure capable of supporting rapid analysis and decision making, and connect the instrument to the global cloud. The latter in tern opens the pathway to the effective data and code sharing, formation of the distributed human-ML teams, and emergence of the lateral instrumental networks.
However, the transition to the automated experiments also requires deep changes in the way scientific community plans and executes experimental activities. To date, all examples of the automated experiment in microscopy we are aware of are performed with the workflows based on fixed policies and a priori known objects of interest. The only examples of beyond human workflows include the inverse discovery experiments based on the deep kernel learning. Going beyond simple imitation of human operation and unleashing the power of automated experiment requires clearly defining the experimental reward, i.e. specific goals. This can include the discovery (curiosity learning), hypothesis falsification, or quantitative measurements. Many of these rewards are defined only within a broader scientific context of specific domain applications. Secondly, this requires formulating the deterministic or probabilistic policies, i.e. algorithms connecting the specific action expressed in the hyper language and the observed state of the system (image or spectra). These policies can be defined prior to the experiment to balance the exploration and exploitation goals. Alternatively, and much more interestingly, the policies can evolve along the experiment to achieve the desired reward within the given experimental budget.
Overall, the current state of the AE in STEM is nascent but fast changing. However, given the rapid emergence of the Python-based APIs and cloud infrastructure, remotely controlled microscopes, and especially given recent advances in active learning methods including Bayesian Optimization, reinforcement learning, and other forms of stochastic optimization, this field is likely to grow quickly in the coming years.

Abstract
To reduce global warming, many countries are shifting to sustainable energy production systems. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are being considered due to their high hydrogen generation efficiency. However, low faradaic efficiency in scaling SOEC technology affects costs and limits large-scale adoption of hydrogen as fuel. This review covers SOECs’ critical aspects: current state-of-the-art anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials, operational and materials parameters affecting faradaic efficiency, and computational modeling techniques to resolve bottlenecks affecting SOEC faradaic efficiency.

Introduction
During the Industrial Revolution, overdependence and overutilization of fossil fuels led to an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, etc. Due to this increase, the average global temperature also has increased by 1.2 °C since 1880—with the greatest changes coming in just the late twentieth century
1
. In order to tackle this issue, many countries are reviewing energy transition strategies to shift towards carbon neutrality
1
,
2
. For instance, almost all members of the United Nations signed the Paris Agreement in 2016 to keep the average global temperature rise to below 2 °C by 2100 as compared with pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit this increase to just 1.5 °C
3
. Consequently, many countries are transitioning towards clean and low-carbon energy to promote decarbonization
1
.
Hydrogen (H
2
) has received significant attention as a clean energy carrier from both researchers
4
and policy makers
5
, and is an important part of the energy mix in a low-carbon energy future
6
. Green H
2
is the cleanest form of H
2
with zero carbon emissions, which is produced using renewable energy
1
. An increased use of renewable energy is important to achieve a sustainable green H
2
7
. Currently, renewable energy H
2
production technologies include water electrolysis and biogas steam reforming. Electrolysis using wind- or hydro-generated electricity is considered to be one of the best green H
2
production sources
8
. Electrolysis can be performed using three types of electrolysis cells: (1) alkaline electrolysis cells (AECs); (2) proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis cells; and (3) solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs)
9
. Among these, SOECs can generate H
2
with the highest efficiency
10
,
11
,
12
. Despite the merits of SOECs, the major drawbacks in scaling SOEC technology are their low faradaic efficiency and high energy costs—or costs per kilogram of H
2
—that limit the large-scale adoption of H
2
as a fuel.
This current review focuses on various operating and materials factors affecting the faradaic efficiency of SOECs, the recent advances in the computational materials science aimed to model various SOEC intrinsic processes, and the needed future computational developments that would complement the ongoing experimental efforts and generate new ground-breaking knowledge required to improve the SOEC faradaic efficiency. In particular, SOEC electrolyte materials are investigated deeply.
Materials used in the SOECs
In this section, the state-of-the-art materials for electrodes (e.g., cathode and anode) and electrolytes (e.g., oxygen-ion conducting and proton-ion conducting) are reviewed. The first subsection describes the advanced electrode materials, while the second subsection provides an update on recent developments in common electrolyte materials.
Electrodes
In SOECs, the selection of two electrodes—anodes and cathodes—is a vital parameter in determining the overall performance of H
2
gas production. Electrodes in SOECs should have the following properties: (a) high ionic conductivity for allowing geometric extension of reaction zone in the entire volume of electrode; (b) high electronic conductivity to improve collection of electrons; (c) a highly porous microstructure for promoting the diffusion of gas, which is a fundamental parameter for oxidation/reduction reactions that ultimately results in increasing the efficiency of SOECs; and (d) high catalytic activity. The active reaction site occurs at the triple-phase boundary, which is the interface between the electronic conductor, the ionic conductor, and the gas diffusion pore
10
,
11
,
12
.
The most common cathode materials that are used in SOECs are nickel (Ni)-based composite materials with yttria (Y
2
O
3
)-stabilized zirconia (ZrO
2
) (YSZ) and yttrium (Y)-doped barium cerate zirconate (BCZY)
10
,
11
,
12
. The main advantages in using Ni-based cathode electrodes are their high electronic conductivity, that they are excellent reforming catalysts, and that they are an electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of water. The Ni-composite electrode acts as a fabrication of supported cell geometry, which allows for the formation of a thin electrolyte, a reduction in ohmic losses, lowering the activation potential, and promoting the electrochemical activity during SOEC operation. Cathode electrode materials are chosen based on the following properties: (1) optimal properties at high temperatures; (2) chemical stability in reducing atmosphere; and (3) a minimal mismatch of thermal and chemical expansion coefficients relative to those of the electrolyte material to prevent mechanical stress. Despite the investigation of different cathode materials, no material exists to meet all of these requirements. One of the most promising strategies for improving stability and electrochemical catalytic activity is the addition of doping materials like manganese (Mn), neodymium (Nd), iron (Fe), and chromium (Cr).
Commonly used anode materials are perovskite (ABO
3
)-based materials
10
,
11
,
12
. The A-site is occupied by large trivalent lanthanide ions (e.g., La
3+
, Pr
3+
, Sm
3+
, Gd
3+
) and is substituted by divalent alkali earth ions (e.g., Ca
2+
, Sr
2+
, Ba
2+
) in order to increase the electronic and ionic conductivities
13
. The B-site is substituted by small trivalent or tetravalent three-dimensional (3D) transition metal ions (e.g., Mn
3+/4+
, Fe
3+/4+
, Co
3+/4+
, Ni
3+/4+
). Strontium-based lanthanum manganite (LSM) is the most commonly used anode electrode material. LSM has a thermal expansion coefficient close to one of the electrolytes, which stabilizes the cell mechanism. LSM is known to have a high electronic conductivity, but a poor ionic conductivity. Other perovskite-based materials—such as double-perovskites and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP)-based materials—also are widely used as anode electrode materials due to their high potential stability and improved performance under a redox atmosphere. The RP-based materials show a higher oxygen-ion conductivity than regular perovskite materials
10
,
11
,
12
. In double-layered perovskite materials (e.g., AA
0
B
2
O
5+
δ
), the A-site is normally occupied by a trivalent lanthanide ion and the A
0
-site by barium (Ba) or strontium (Sr), while the B-site is a mixture of the first-row transition metal ions.
Electrolytes
The most important electrochemical system component is the electrolyte. It has a large impact on cell performance through its contribution to the ohmic internal resistance. The ideal electrolyte used in SOECs should possess a high ionic conductivity, a negligible electronic conductivity, a good thermal and chemical stability, a matching thermal coefficient, a lower activation energy, a high density, and a minimum reactant crossover
13
.
SOECs can be further subdivided into two categories—oxygen-ion conducting cells and proton-ion conducting cells, as shown in Fig.
1
. The most distinct difference between the proton-ion and oxygen-ion SOEC is the electrolyte-conducting ion, which further results in different working principles. In the case of the proton-ion conducting electrolyte, H
+
ions/protons are transported from the anode electrode to the cathode electrode, where H
2
gas is produced. In the case of the oxide-ion conducting electrolyte, the oxygen ions migrate from the cathode side of the cell to the anode side. Steam is fed to the anode side in the case of the proton-ion conducting electrolyte; however, for the oxygen-ion electrolyte, it is fed to the cathode side. There are several advantages of using a proton-ion electrolysis cell, such as dry and pure H
2
gas that can be directly produced at the cathode side of the fuel, which further simplifies the system and reduces operational costs. Compressed H
2
can be directly produced through increasing the operating pressure. Thus, in-situ electrochemical compression can potentially increase the total energy efficiency
14
. The operating temperature of the proton-ion electrolysis cell is around 673 to 973 K, which is lower than that of the oxygen-ion electrolysis cell of 973 to 1273 K. The lower operating temperature leads to a lower cost in sealing materials and interconnection, which increases the overall durability of the cell. A detailed description of the different oxygen-ion and proton-ion electrolyte materials is provided in ref.
15

Oxygen-ion conductivity arises due to the mobility of oxygen point defects, which can be oxygen vacancies or the transport of oxygen in the positions of the interstitials via a hopping mechanism
16
. Zirconia- and ceria-based materials are widely investigated as potential candidates for the oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte. In the case of ceria-based material, partial electronic conductivity at elevated temperatures and a reduced atmosphere occurs, which is due to the reduction of the Ce
4+
to Ce
3+
ions. Such partial electronic conductivity causes a decrease in faradaic efficiency
17
. YSZ is commonly used as an oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte because it can be used in high temperature applications
16
. YSZ is developed by using cubic fluorite structure yttria (Y
2
O
3
) as a dopant within the zirconia (ZrO
2
) structure. Despite having excellent conductivity during SOEC operation, the degradation of material and a reduction in the performance of SOEC hindered the further investigation and development of YSZ material. The degradation issues and low ionic conductivity of YSZ has led to the development of scandia (Sc
2
O
3
)-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) material, which shows higher ionic conductivity than YSZ at intermediate temperatures. In addition, the current density of ScSZ-based electrolytes is approximately twice that of the YSZ-based electrolytes
18
. However, the cost of Sc in addition to small Sc ion size would lead to diffusivity and separation into impurity phases
19
. LaGaO
3
-based materials have shown high conductivity and a high transfer number of O
2−
ions, thus making them a promising electrolyte candidate at intermediate temperatures
18
. However, the incompatibility of the Ni-based cathode and LaGaO
3
-based electrolyte is a major issue in LaNiO
3
formation
20
.
In summary, due to the high operating temperatures of oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes, the degradation of the cell occurs at a faster rate. Even the current state-of-the-art YSZ oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte suffers degradation in the high corrosive environment of electrolysis and shows a lower ion conductivity and lower catalytic activity at lower operating temperatures
17
. Most of the delamination failure occurs at the interface region between the cathode electrode and the electrolyte, which is primarily caused due to the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient of the materials
20
. For this reason, the trend has shifted towards the proton-ion conducting electrolyte materials, which offer more advantages as mentioned earlier.
Due to their easy synthesis, high thermal stability, and low cost, perovskite crystal structure (ABO
3
)-based proton-ion conducting electrolytes, as observed in Fig.
2
21
, have gained more attention than fluorite (AO
2
) and pyrochlore (A
2
B
2
O
7
)-based electrolytes
22
. In a typical perovskite structure, the A-site is occupied by an alkaline-earth element (e.g., Ba, Sr, Ca), while the B-site is occupied by a tetravalent element—usually Ce or Zr. For an electrolyte, protonation is required, which increases the number of charge carriers while still keeping the material neutral. Thus, to promote protonic conductivity, it is important to dope the B-site with trivalent elements (e.g., Y, Nd, Sm, Yb, In, Eu, Gd, etc.). Doping with trivalent elements leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies that play a crucial part in the formation and mobility of protons. Protons are transported through three major steps: (1) dissociative adsorption; (2) Grotthuss mechanism; and (3) rotational diffusion. With dissociative adsorption, oxygen defects are created after the addition of trivalent elements to keep a neutral charge in the system. For every two dopant atoms, one oxygen vacancy is created. In the presence of water vapor, these oxygen vacancies are occupied by the hydroxyl ions that are formed by dissociation of water into H
2
(protons) and hydroxide ions, as shown in Fig.
3
. With the Grotthuss mechanism, the mobile protons or the H
2
ions interact to form a weak bond with oxygen atoms, as seen in Fig.
4
. With rotational diffusion, the protonic defect rotates and reorients itself to facilitate the transport of protons from one oxygen atom to the neighboring oxygen atom
16
, as shown in Fig.

The most commonly investigated proton-ion conducting electrolyte materials are barium cerate (BaCeO
3
) and barium zirconate (BaZrO
3
). Among these two materials, BaCeO
3
has a high proton conductivity
23
,
24
,
25
; however, it also has a low chemical stability, which makes it unsuitable for applications. On the other hand, barium zirconate-based electrolytes exhibit good chemical stability under carbon dioxide and a water-containing atmosphere. However, due to the refractory nature of BaZrO
3
, high sintering temperatures (e.g., >1600 °C) are required, which makes the fabrication of this material highly unfeasible.
In general, further research and developments in proton-ion conducting electrolytes can make the ideal choice as the electrolyte materials, which will have high ionic conductivity, negligible electronic conductivity, and good thermal and chemical stability.
Factors affecting the efficiency of SOEC
A much-desired electrolyte material property is negligible electronic conductivity. Unfortunately, non-negligible charge carriers—other than protons—are known to exist
26
,
27
,
28
,
29
. Fig.
5
schematically illustrates the charge carriers in a proton-ion conducting electrolyte. The existence of partial charge carriers—such as an oxide-ion, hole, and electron—decreases the protonic transfer number and overall efficiency of the cell. In the oxidizing environment, the formation of electron holes occurs, and the presence of holes causes the internal leakage current, which further results in a decrease of the faradaic efficiency

Iwahara et al.
33
reported that the faradaic efficiency of the proton-ion conducting electrolyte is between 50 and 95%. Babiniec et al.
34
measured a faradaic efficiency of only 32% at 100 mA and 973 K for the cell having a thin BCZY27 electrolyte layer and a Ni-BCZY27 fuel electrode. Using BZY20 as the electrolyte material, the faradaic efficiency ~63.6% at 1.3 V and 873 K was reported by Lei et al.
35
Details of more faradaic efficiencies with a variety of electrode and electrolyte materials can be found elsewhere
36
. Low faradaic efficiency decreases the overall performance of the electrolysis cell. In order to tackle this issue, studying different factors influencing the efficiency is paramount.
An important factor in increasing faradaic efficiency is to reduce the electronic conductivity of the electrolyte material. The effects of temperature, O
2
partial pressure, H
2
O partial pressure, chemical composition, and external current (externally applied voltage) on the electronic conductivity have been studied thoroughly in the literature
32
. In addition to the above factors, additional strategies are discussed that help in increasing the faradaic efficiencies.
Temperature
The activation energy for the electronic conductivity is greater than the oxygen-ionic and protonic conductivities
37
,
38
. Thus, as the temperature increases, a significant increase in the electronic conductivity is observed. To reduce the unwanted effects of electronic contribution, lowering the operational temperature of the electrolysis cell can be the best option to consider
39
. This strategy is an ongoing process by developing new electrolyte materials
38
,
40
,
41
,
42
, novel thin film technologies
43
,
44
,
45
, and an innovative highly active electrode system
46
,
47
,
48
. It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that decreasing the operating temperature decreases the electronic conductivity for BZY, BCZY, and BCY materials
39
,
49
. In addition, lowering the operational temperature helps in maintaining the low ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and low polarization resistance of the electrode.
Water and oxygen partial pressure
Under humidifying atmosphere, protons are formed due to the dissociation of water. The oxygen vacancies (
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
) that were previously generated by acceptor doping are occupied by the hydroxide ion, thereby forming a protonic defect (
\({{OH}}_{o}^{.}\)
) which leads to the formation of a weak bond between proton and the regular lattice oxide-ion, as observed in Fig.
2
. The hydration reaction is as follows
32
,
50
:
$${H}_{2}O+\,{V}_{o}^{..}\,+\,{O}_{x}^{o}\leftrightarrows 2{{OH}}_{o}^{.}$$
(1)
While in an oxidizing atmosphere, the oxygen occupies the
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
, which leads to the appearance of electronic holes (
\(\dot{h})\)
. The redox reaction is as follows
32
,
50
:
$$0.5\,{O}_{2,{gas}}+{V}_{o}^{..}\,\leftrightarrows\, {O}_{x}^{o}+2\dot{h}$$
(2)
Heras-Juaristi et al.
49
investigated the partial conductivity of oxygen-ion (
\({\sigma }_{v}\)
), proton (
\({\sigma }_{H})\)
and electron hole (
\({\sigma }_{h})\)
as a function of partial pressure of water (
p
H
2
O) in the BCZY27 material, as observed in Fig.
6
. At high temperature (800 °C) and high partial pressure of oxygen (
p
O
2
= 0.2 atm), as shown in Fig.
6a
,
\({\sigma }_{h}\)
was the main contributor towards the total conductivity (
\({\sigma }_{{total}})\)
of the material. While at lower
p
O
2
(~10
−5
atm), as seen in Fig.
6b
, the contribution of
\({\sigma }_{h}\)
towards the
\({\sigma }_{{total}}\)
decreases. This means that the high
p
O
2
leads to larger electronic conductivity, which can be explained by Eq.
2
, where higher
p
O
2
is thermodynamically favorable for the formation of more electrons. In all four cases, as shown in Fig.
6a
through Fig.
6a
, a decrease in
\({\sigma }_{h}\)
with an increase in the
p
H
2
O is observed, which is due to the suppression of electron-hole formation, while an increase in
\({\sigma }_{H}\)
as a function of
p
H
2
O also was observed due to the formation of a thermodynamically stable proton defect as explained in Eq.

p

helps in increasing the overall faradaic efficiency.
Chemical compositions
Chemical compositions play an important role in the overall conductivity of SOEC materials. In this section, studies related to the effect of A- and B-site doping on the protonic/hole conductivities are included.

o
C and a Zr-enriched phase (
x
= 0.8), hole conductivity is predominant. A possible explanation for this behavior is related to: (1) the grain boundary features, where decreasing the grain size results in an increase in both grain boundary density and resistance to ionic transportation, while no detrimental effect on electronic transport is observed; and (2) the grain features, where in case of more packed perovskite structures, the ionic conductivity decreases, while the relative contribution of p-type electronic conductivity increases

materials, which reduced the oxygen-ion conductivity, while an increase in the proton transport was observed. Kato et al.

studied the transport properties of zirconates formed with various alkaline-earth elements (e.g.,

A
= Ca, Sr, Ba, or Ba/Sr). They found that when the A-site is substituted by Ba, the material becomes predominant electronic conduction, as the hole transfer number is equal to 0.72. While, when the A-site is substituted by Sr and Ca, the hole transfer number is equal to 0.33 and 0.15, respectively. These results suggest that a notable difference in the electronic transport variations is observed due to modification in the A-site and B-site of the ABO
3
structures. The conductivity of ABO
3
materials is inversely proportionate to the electro-negativity of the A and B elements
28
. Han et al.
58
investigated the effect of doping elements (e.g., Y, In, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb) on the transport number in BaZrO
3
. The authors observed that the lowest transport number of electron hole was found for the doping element ‘Y.’ Furthermore, both Ba-excess and Ba-deficiency led to an increase in the electron hole transport number. The doping element tends to distort the ideal cubic structure to become orthorhombic; further, an increase in the orthorhombic parameter is observed with an increase in the size of the dopant ion. However, Y shows a contrasting trend that yields a smaller parameter, which in turn reduces strain energy and increases defect mobility
59
.
External current
Finally, the external current or external applied voltage also have a significant impact on faradaic efficiency. Therefore, many recent studies have focused on investigating the effect of external current on faradaic efficiencies. Zhu et al.
36
developed a model to predict faradaic efficiency as a function of electrolysis cell operating conditions. They found that faradaic efficiency increases as imposed current density increases. This is because the cell behaves as a concentration cell at an open circuit (e.g., zero imposed current), driving the protons towards the steam side and resulting into reverse proton flux, which leads to a decrease in faradaic efficiency. A similar trend was observed from other studies
60
,
61
,
62
,
63
. However, for the same materials and operating conditions, an opposite trend was reported
64
,
65
,
66
,
67
. A possible explanation was that as the imposed current density increases, the ohmic heating within the membrane and charge transfer polarization at the electrode–electrolyte interface increase leading to an increase in temperature and a decrease in faradaic efficiency
36
. This discrepancy suggests that there is a knowledge gap, and no published paper explains the discrepancy that can be qualitatively assessed. Thus, more efforts and research are required to study this problem.
Other factors
In addition to the above strategies of lowering the operating temperature, an increase in the partial pressure of H
2
O, the doping strategy, and two additional approaches can be used to mitigate electron leakage: (1) the use of an electron-blocking layer between the electrode and the electrolyte, which protects the grains of the electrolyte from reduction and consequently reduces the electronic conductivity;
68
,
69
and (2) a double-layer electrolyte strategy, especially in the case of Ce-based electrolyte, to block the electron conductivity due to a reduction in Ce

Current modeling and simulation efforts
Computational modeling is a powerful tool that has allowed researchers to physically understand and explain the mechanism behind the experimentally observed properties and trend. Modeling at the atomic/molecular level (e.g., microscale) plays a vital role in understanding the different reaction pathways. It is an effective way to understand or reveal the interaction mechanisms between reactants and the catalytic surface. For this reason, the microscale modeling technique—density functional theory (DFT) – ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), molecular dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), and multiscale modeling approaches are reviewed in detail in the following subsections.
DFT and AIMD modeling
One of the main problems with SOECs is the stability of the materials
72
. DFT has been used in studying the stability and degradation of the materials. Rashkeev et al.
73
developed the DFT and thermodynamic model to investigate the mechanisms of oxygen delamination in SOECs consisting of a YSZ electrolyte and an LSM oxygen electrode. The authors found that the diffusion of atoms across the interface at high temperature significantly affects the structural stability of materials and interfaces. In addition, La and Sr substitutional defects in the ZrO
2
oxide and at the interfaces significantly change the oxygen transport, which may lead to the development of pressure at the interface and eventually leading to the delamination process. Nikolla et al.
74
investigated the stability and degradation of Ni in the presence of carbon-based fuels. They found that alloying the Ni surface increases carbon tolerance by oxidizing the C atoms rather than forming C-C bonds. Similar simulations on Ni and Cu (111) and (211), as well as Cu-Ni and Cu-Co alloys in the presence of CH
4
, were carried out by Galea et al.
75
. Despite the fact that C was discovered to have a very high thermodynamic and kinetic barrier to CH
4
dissociation, C was discovered to strongly adsorb onto the Ni (211) surface and grow graphitic carbon over the terrace. This dissociation barrier prevents breakdown and creates possibilities for electrochemical oxidation occurring directly. The Cu-Ni and Cu-Co alloys demonstrated that Ni and Co have little impact on the Cu surface and that the Cu enrichment of the alloy surface limits stability. Raja et al.
76
studied the stability of BaZrO
3
at high temperature using AIMD. This study revealed that the high-temperature stability of BaZrO
3
is mainly due to the phonon contribution to the free migration energy of the O vacancy. Ribeiro et al.
77
used AIMD-based calculations to study the temperature-dependent phase change in YSZ as a function of Ti content. The results from this study suggest that YSZ structures doped with small amount of Ti are both energetically and kinetically more stable than the undoped YSZ structures, and ideal proportion being 3% TiO

doping.
DFT-based methods are also used to study hydration, adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion at the interface and in the bulk region. The adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion of hydrogen in pure Ni and the Ni/YSZ slab with two different interfaces (Ni/cation and Ni/O) were studied by Weng et al.
78
using DFT. The H-atom binds preferentially at the hollow site on the Ni surface with an adsorption energy of −2.68 eV, while the H
2
molecule gets adsorbed on the top site of the Ni surface with an adsorption energy of −0.34 eV. The calculated energy barrier for H
2
dissociation on both surface is 0.1 eV. Comparing the diffusion energies of H through the surface and bulk suggests that the surface path is more favorable. In addition, the author found that the barrier for the H migration through Ni/O greater than through Ni/cation. Bhatia et al.
79
used DFT calculations to examine the behavior of hydrogen on three flat Ni surfaces—Ni(100), Ni(110), and Ni(111)—and two stepped Ni surfaces—Ni(531) and Ni(210). It was found that hydrogen diffuses faster on the flat surfaces, but the stepped surface showed a greater mobility in comparison to the diffusion into the metal from the surface layer. Jing et al.
80
performed DFT calculations to investigate the hydration process in yttrium-doped strontium zirconate (SZY) and YSZ materials. The authors found that the SRO(001) surface of SZY and the Ni(111) surface of YSZ is more favorable for water absorption. In the case of proton migrations from surface to bulk, DFT calculations showed that the energy barrier for YSZ is larger than that of SZY for both hydroxide ion migration and proton-hopping. While in the case of proton migration in both bulk structures, the energy barriers are relatively small and comparable. Klarbring et al.
81
used non-equilibrium AIMD to study the diffusion and ionic conductivity in Sm-doped ceria using color diffusion algorithm. In the case of ionic conductivity, the results from AIMD showed good agreement with the experimental values. In case of O–diffusion, the external field used did not influence site preference of the Sm-dopants, which previous studies showed that O-vacancies prefer positions close to Sm atoms
82
,
83
. AIMD calculations were performed by Fronzi et al.
84
to investigate the proton diffusion in the undoped BaZrO
3
cubic structure. Three strain conditions were applied – fully relaxed, isometric tensile strength and compressive strain conditions. The authors found that applied external strain has no-linear effect on the proton diffusion constant and an enhancement in the proton diffusion was observed under compressive strain conditions. Zhu et al.
85
studied the proton diffusion behavior caused by presence of
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
in Ca doped BZY
2
material using experimental techniques, DFT and AIMD-based calculations. Experimental study suggested that Ca
2+
can be successfully doped at the B-site forming the BZCa
1
Y
2
. Due to the weak bond strength of Ca-O bonds, oxygen vacancies tend to form next to Ca, according to DFT simulations. Calculations using AIMD have shown that BZCa
1
Y
2
has a greater diffusion coefficient than BZY
2
, which is supported by the much-decelerated trapping effect with the presence of
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
.
DFT-based calculations have been used to investigate the role of catalysts on the electrocatalytic activity in electrode-based materials, which affect the electrochemical performance
86
. Using the DFT model, Cadi-Essadek et al.
87
assessed the stability of various Ni cluster configurations on ZrO
2
and YSZ. The authors found that the formation of an Ni-Ni bond was easier than an Ni-electrolyte interaction. This results in the formation of preferred pyramidal shape instead of flat structures. The stability of Ni clusters was affected by temperature and resulted into the aggregation of Ni-other atoms or clusters. Ingram et al.
88
used DFT calculations and kinetic modeling to investigate relevant reactions associated with the direct utilization of methane on different electrocatalysts. This allowed to compare relative activity of different materials and identify the optimal performing material. The author found that a family of materials (e.g., Ni, Co, Rh, Ru, Ir) offer maximum activity for all relevant reactions. Using DFT-based calculations, Muñoz-García et al.
89
investigated catalytic activity of both Zr substitution with Fe and Mn in a barium zirconate (BZO) environment for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. Their study showed that the lowest overpotential as the ORR catalyst was obtained by BZM, while Fe in the stoichiometric BZF surface appears to be insufficient for both ORR and OER. In DFT, the oxygen p-band center has been used for fundamental understanding of an array of perovskite compounds for use in catalyzing the ORR and OER. Properties predictions using the O p-band includes catalytic properties, such as a high-temperature surface exchange rate for the ORR

. Choi et al.
95
used quantum mechanical calculations (DFT and AIMD) to study the ORR on Sr-doped LaMnO
3
. The authors found that B cations are more active than A cations for oxygen reduction on a number of perovskite-type ABO
3
cathodes is supported by the fact that O
2
species are preferentially adsorbed on the Mn site rather than the La site. A DFT-based study carried out by Jacobs et al.
96
suggests that under a consistent computational framework, robust linear correlations between a variety of significant metrics of catalytic activity and the oxygen p-band bulk descriptor can be found. More DFT-based studies on different aspects of electrode materials can be found elsewhere
97
.
DFT calculations have been used in investigating defect chemistries and thermodynamics, which gives insights about SOEC materials in operating conditions. Bjørheim et al.
98
for the first time, used first-principle calculations to investigate the phonon contribution to the defect thermodynamics (
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
and
\({{OH}}_{o}^{.}\)
) of the ZrO
2
terminated (001) surface of BaZrO
3
material. The vibrational formation entropy of the surface
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
is significantly higher than that of the bulk
\({V}_{o}^{..}\)
, which is due to the smaller structural relaxations. However, in case of the
\({{OH}}_{o}^{.},\)
it displays near identical vibrational spectra at the surface and in the bulk structure. Using first-principle DFT calculations, Bjørheim et al.
99
investigated the impact of phonons on the hydration and defect thermodynamics of undoped and acceptor (e.g., Sc, In, Y, Gd) doped BaZrO
3
material. They found that for all of the dopants, the vibrational formation entropy of oxygen vacancy is significantly lower than the protonic defect, which is also the dominant contributor to the entropy of hydration. In addition, the calculated hydration entropy becomes more negative in the order of Y < Gd < In < Sc, because both the formation energy and vibrational formation entropy of oxygen vacancy and protonic defect become more negative with increasing dopant ion size. In addition, Bjørheim et al.
100
also investigated the structural, electronic and thermodynamic properties of neutral and positively doubly charged oxygen vacancies in BaZrO
3
using AIMD calculations. The author observed that, due to both the charged oxygen vacancy’s severe deformation of the local structure and its substantial negative formation volume, phonons are demonstrated to contribute significantly to the charged oxygen vacancy’s formation energy at high temperatures (1 eV at 1000 K). The ensuing lattice distortions for the neutral vacancy, and consequently the phonon contributions to the free formation energy, are much less. As a result, from 0 K to 1000 K, the charge transition level for oxygen vacancies (+2/0) varies from 0.42 to 0.83 eV below the conduction band bottom due to phonon effects on the relative stability of the two defects. By combining the ab initio results with thermodynamics modeling, defect formation at finite temperature and pressure were investigated by Björketun et al.
101
, who found that protonic defects are thermodynamically stable only at low temperatures, which is in agreement with the empirical results. By taking into account the configuration of complex defects, Takahashi et al.
102
investigated the influence of fundamental factors that affect the hydration of BaZrO
3
doped with trivalent cations (e.g., Al, Sc, Ga, Y, In, Lu). They found that Al- and Ga-doped BZOs are more likely to form oxygen vacancies, which results in low hydration energies and stable proton sites at the closest neighbor (1NN). However, BaZrO
3
that have been doped with Y, In, and Lu prefer protons at the second nearest neighbor (2NN). DFT-based thermodynamic modeling was performed by Lee et al.
103
to investigate the effect of humidity and pressure of H
2
/O
2
gas on the defect chemistry and transport characteristics of BZY in the temperature range of 800 to 1200 K. The authors found that oxygen vacancies formed to compensate for extra Ba vacancies may cause a slight increase in protonation, while a decrease in overall proton diffusivity was observed due to trapping of protons near the Ba vacancies. DFT and AIMD-based calculations have also been used to study the generation, migration, dissociation and transport of electron-hole pairs in photovoltaic or solar cells
104
,
105
. Similar studies can also be performed to study the electron-hole pair migration and interactions in the SOECs.
Screening new materials and performing fundamental research can be easily enabled through the Material Genome Initiative (MGI)
106
,
107
database, and DFT and AIMD-based studies have been successfully using the MGI database in exploring new materials
108
,
109
. MGI is of significant importance to expedite the material discovery and development process.
The main issue with DFT and AIMD-based studies is the limit on the number of atoms that can be efficiently simulated. In addition, temperature-dependent phenomena and harsh environmental chemistries (e.g., electron migration energy calculations, secondary chemistry calculations with explicit electrons in the system) that tend to lower the faradaic efficiency cannot be simulated using DFT. Also, the timescale that DFT simulations could access is another limiting factor.
MD modeling
In recent years, MD studies have played a crucial role in studying the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) on the oxygen diffusion pathway and proton diffusion in different SOEC materials, especially electrolyte materials. Chang et al.
110
studied the GB effect of ionic transport at higher temperatures using Buckingham potential in MD. This study also showed the presence of GBs, degraded ion transport characteristics. At lower temperatures, GBs dominate ion transport, while at higher temperatures, the influence of GBs was eliminated because the migration energy barrier was overcome. Fisher et al.
111
studied the oxygen diffusivity in pure zirconia and 8 mol% YSZ over a temperature range of 1273 to 2673 K using MD. The authors found that open GB enables oxygen transport and the rate of diffusion in the bulk structure of YSZ crystals is slow. A number of intrinsic vacancies are present at the interface of pure ZO
2
bicrystals, according to MD simulations, and these promote GB diffusion at elevated temperatures
112
. An MD study by Fisher et al.
113
investigated the structure and ion transport properties of three interfaces in 8 mol% YSZ, which included tilt and twist GBs. The authors found that symmetrical tilt GB decreases the overall conductivity because of the trapping of vacancies in the GB region. However, twist GB enables rapid diffusion with an opportunity to provide means for enhancing the ionic conductivity of YSZ ceramics. Gonzalez-Romero et al.
114
studied the physical characteristics (e.g., GB energies and oxygen diffusion) of Σ3, Σ5, Σ11, and Σ13 GBs in model of YSZ bicrystals as a function of the concentration of yttria and temperature. Lee et al.
115
performed a hybrid MC-MD modeling study on the defect distribution near tilt GBs in YSZ and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) materials. They found that in both materials, oxygen vacancy segregation precedes dopant segregation near the GB. Moreover, GDC showed a stronger dopant segregation than YSZ despite a smaller size mismatch between host and dopant cations. From this result, the authors made a conclusion that dopant segregation is initiated by vacancy segregation and largely controlled by dopant-vacancy association. Similarly, many MD studies on the GBs of YSZ material have been studied

117
,

,
119
.
MD studies have successfully been used to describe how the concentration of doping elements can affect oxygen migration, oxygen diffusivity, and defect interactions. Using Buckingham-type potentials in MD, Devanathan et al.
120
studied the effect of doping concentration on oxygen migration and defect interactions in YSZ. They found that with 6 to 25 mol% yttria in YSZ, the activation energy of oxygen diffusion was found to be 0.6 to 1.0 eV. Also, the formation of
\({\rm{Y}}-{V}_{o}^{..}-{\rm{Y}}\)
with a binding energy of −0.85 eV could play an important role in any conductivity degradation of YSZ. Oxygen vacancy migration properties were studied by Kilo et al.
121
by using experimental and MD methods (Buckingham potential). The authors found that experimentally, the oxygen diffusion was highest for the 10 mol% yttria in YSZ. While MD results consistently showed higher diffusion coefficient values than the experiments, the MD predicted activation enthalpy of migration showed a good agreement with the experimental results. Araki et al.
122
studied the oxygen diffusion in 4, 8, and 14 mol% yttria (e.g., 4YSZ, 8YSZ, 14YSZ) in YSZ subjected to uniaxial tension in the [100], [110], and [111]. An increase in the oxygen diffusivity along the tensile direction in all three cases (e.g., [100], [110], [111]) was observed for 4YSZ and 8YSZ. However, in the case of 14YSZ, the oxygen diffusivity remained unchanged, probably due to the higher yttria content. Shimojo et al.
123
investigated the structural and dynamical properties of YSZ for the three dopant concentration—4.85, 10.2, and 22.7 mol% yttria in YSZ. The authors found that dopant Y ions play a significant role in oxygen diffusion. At lower dopant concentration, Y ions promote the migration of O ions; however, as the concentration increases, a decrease in diffusion constant was observed. The restriction by the Y-Y edge causes a decrease in the diffusivity with an increase in the dopant concentration
124
.
In addition, phase composition and structural stability were analyzed using MD. Ogawa et al.
125
modeled zirconia polycrystal and investigated the microscopic mechanism of high-temperature deformation. The material was deformed at 1500 K under tensile stress up to 8 GPa. The model was found to be stable up to 2 GPa, and largely elongated at stresses above 6 GPa. A disordered layer at the GB was observed and seemed to play an important role in the deformation process. Chang et al.
126
investigated the effect of the cubic/monoclinic phase composition on the oxygen-ion diffusion in zirconia-based solid electrolytes using Born-Meyer-Buckingham potential in MD. They found that due to the presence of an unfavorable monoclinic structure for small-ion penetration, the pure cubic-phase system had more effective thermal motions with extended and continuous movements than the dual-phase system. The diffusion coefficient analysis revealed that the pure monoclinic structure was unaffected by the material composition, while the phase and material composition controlled the diffusion mechanisms.
Most of the above MD studies used short-range Buckingham potential and long-range Coulombic potential for investigating different aspects in the SOEC materials. The Buckingham potential is a simplified version of the Lennard-Jones potential, which cannot accurately capture the effects of temperature and pressure on the interaction between atoms. On the other hand, the reactive potential - ReaxFF developed by van Duin et al.
127
includes many-body interactions, which allows for accurate interactions between the atoms. ReaxFF also considers the effect of temperature and pressure on the interactions between atoms, which is of significant importance in case of accurate predictions of SOEC materials in different conditions.
In 2008, van Duin et al.
128
developed a ReaxFF to study proton diffusion across the GB using the MD simulations. This study paved the way for decades-long simulations using ReaxFF. Cammarata et al.
129
studied the structural changes and proton mobility for the undoped, singly, and doubly Y-doped BaZrO
3
with varying temperatures ranging from 100–1200 K using ReaxFF MD. The MD results well-reproduced the behavior already observed by the quantum mechanics (QM) calculations where two important conclusions were inferred: (1) the clustering of yttrium in BZY were seen; and (2) out of the three oxygen site sets, two yttrium-clustered models acted as multilevel protonic traps, which delayed the protonic diffusion in the bulk. This was due to the large number of proton-hopping events that occurred between those oxygen atoms that were surrounded by clustered yttrium atoms. Thus, proton conductivity in these materials can be improved by avoiding such clustering. Li et al.
130
studied the O
2−
transport properties, as well as the migration mechanism in Y doped BaZrO
3
with/without edge dislocations using ReaxFF MD. In addition, they studied the effect of dopant concentration and temperature on thermodynamic and kinetic properties of bulk and dislocation system. The authors found that below 20 mol% Y content in BZY, O
2−
ion conduction is promoted, while the maximum O
2−
conductivity was observed for the model having 30 mol% Y doped in dislocated BZY. Moreover, dislocations in the model accelerate the O
2−
diffusion when the temperature is less than 1173.15 K due to the formation of double-bottle diffusion channels. Using ReaxFF MD, Ottochian et al.
131
studied the effect of isotropic and biaxial strain on proton conduction in Y-doped BaZrO
3
at different temperatures (e.g., 1500–2000 K). They observed that compressive pressure led to an increase in the proton conductivity, while the effect of biaxial strain is more complex. In the case of intermediate biaxial strain, an increase in the proton conductivity was observed because of the shortened O-O distance. However, an opposite trend was observed in case of higher compressive biaxial strain, due to strong localization of proton far from the B-site cations. Merinov et al.
132
developed a ReaxFF force field for studying the electrode–electrolyte interface. These parameters have facilitated to re-calculate the primary energy barrier for proton diffusion in BZY which shows a good agreement with experimental values. More MD-based studies with different FF can be found elsewhere
133
.
The inaccuracy in predicting the electron affinity or ionization potential restricts the applicability of ReaxFF in redox reactions
134
. This led to the development of an electron version of ReaxFF termed ‘eReaxFF.’
135
In this potential, electrons-like or hole-like particles are explicitly included. This method has been successfully used to simulate the electronic motion in carbon-based
135
, lithium-electrolyte
136
, Ag metal
137
, and polyethylene electrical breakdown systems
138
.
As mentioned previously, electron holes (e.g., electronic conductivity) significantly decrease faradaic efficiency. Therefore, to simulate electronic current leakage, the electrons/hole pair should be explicitly included, which is currently not involved in almost all force fields, except for the eReaxFF. However, the parallel version is only incorporated in the Amsterdam Density Functional package
139
. Since the parallel version is still not available in most MD software packages, the dependency of the serial version is increased, which ultimately limits the size of the eReaxFF MD that can be efficiently simulated.
In addition to the classical interatomic force fields, recently, machine-learned force fields (MLFF) have emerged as an ideal solution to drastically augment length and timescales accessible to MD simulations and retaining first-principle accuracy. Verdi et al.
140
developed a MLFF based on MD and Bayesian interface to describe the thermodynamic properties of zirconia. This MLFF accurately captured the temperature-induced phase transformation below the melting point. Guan et al.
141
recently developed a global neural network potential (G-NN) for the YSZ. They carried long-time molecular dynamics simulations for YSZ at 6.7, 8, 10, and 14.3 mol % over a wide temperature range (800–2000 K). In addition, Guan et al.
142
developed a stochastic surface walking global exploration with G-NN potential (SSW-NN) to investigate changes in the microstructure of YSZ with different concentrations of Y. Wang et al.
143
developed a MLFF to investigate anisotropic fracture behavior of BaZrO
3
material. The author observed that the fracture strength in the [110] crystal orientation is more significant than the [100] crystal orientation. Niu et al.
144
using AIMD and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) studied the proton migration in Y-doped BaZrO
3
material. The author observed that at shorter time, the performs superdiffusion through the O–H, while at longer time, proton diffusion first becomes subdiffusive due to OH ion rotation and then gradually turns to normal diffusion. Kholtobina et al.
145
investigated the temperature dependencies of surface energies for (111) and (110) CeO
2
with extended two-stage up-sampled thermodynamic integration using Langevin dynamics (TU-TILD). This method was used together with machine learning potentials called moment tensor potentials (MTP). The authors found that the increase in the temperature from 0 to 2100 K led to the decrease of the Helmholtz free energy of (111) CeO
2
from 0.78 to 0.64 Jm

MC modeling
This section includes a review of MC-based studies on the order of reaction mechanism, oxygen diffusivity, conductivity, electrode degradation, and defect interactions. Some important processes and aspects of cell physics occur on a timescale much longer than the MD timescale (e.g., in nanoseconds). MC methods, which are at a larger length and timescales are suited to study these phenomena. MC-based modeling does not include identifying new reaction pathways, but rather focuses on the complexities associated with the interaction of particles
146
. Modak and Lusk
146
used kinetic MC (KMC) techniques to simulate open circuit voltage and an electrical double layer of doped electrolyte. The study was mainly focused on electrical-physical processes and the results from KMC modeling showed a good agreement with the predictions from the analytical model. The main idea for developing these algorithms was to use it as a sub-model in a more complex and realistic KMC simulator, which accounts for oxidation reaction on the surface of the anode.
KMC has also been used to investigate the reaction mechanism and oxygen-ion diffusion conductivity. Pornprasertsuk et al.

DFT results suggest that a decrease in the conductivity with a higher dopant concentration is due to the higher migration energy required to travel across two adjacent Y-Zr and Y-Y pairs. While the KMC results reveal that the increase in migration energy is due to the higher probability of oxygen vacancies encountering Y-Zr and Y-Y pairs. Another study by Pornprasertsuk et al.

used quantum calculation-based KMC to study oxide-ion diffusion process and the space charge double layer at the electrode–electrolyte interface subject to applied alternating potentials, as well as the dependence of impedance and double layer capacitance on the thickness of the electrolyte. The simulation showed that at lower frequencies, oxide ions have sufficient time to migrate across the electrolyte and accumulate at the electrode–electrolyte interface creating a double layer with a space charge. Longer time is needed for thicker electrolytes to reach the same level of oxide-ion vacancies at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Wang et al.

developed a KMC model based on a series of reversible elementary steps for simulating ORR at the cathode-electrolyte interface and hydrogen-oxidation mechanism near the anode-electrolyte interface. They found that increasing applied bias voltage, operating temperature, and relative permittivity YSZ and decreasing the thickness of YSZ increased the ionic current density and efficiency of the cell. Krishnamurthy et al.

developed a DFT-based KMC model to study the diffusion of oxygen in YSZ. Oxygen diffusivity was found to increase with an increase in the yttria mole fraction before attaining a maximum value of ~0.1 mole fraction yttria. To understand the physical mechanisms underlying the observed behavior, analytical models were developed. Based on the analyses, two factors that explained the observed behavior were: (1) an increase in the number of high migration energy Y-Zr and Y-Y edges; and (2) an increased dopant induced and vacancy dopant correlations at higher yttria content. Dholabhai et al.
151
used a DFT-based kinetic lattice Monte Carlo (KLMC) model to investigate the optimal dopant concentration in GDC for maximum ionic conductivity. They found that higher dopant concentrations increase the vacancy concentration, which thus increases ionic conductivity. However, at higher concentrations, vacancy-vacancy repulsion impedes the diffusion process, which thus reduces the ionic conductivity. At a 20 to 25% mole fraction of Gd, the maximum ionic conductivity was predicted. Gunn et al.
152
developed hybrid MC (HMC) and adaptive KMC (AKMC) models based on Buckingham potentials to study the thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic properties in the gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC). HMC demonstrated the movement of oxygen vacancy from bulk to surface, while the AKMC was crucial in finding multi-atom concerted diffusion mechanisms spanning over large distances.
Other factors like the aging of electrodes and defect interactions were also studied using MC. The KMC simulation model developed by Zhang et al.
153
was used to study the thermal aging of infiltrated electrodes by considering the surface diffusion mechanism. The effects of temperature, infiltration loading, wettability, and electrode configuration were studied, as well as the geometric parameters, which included the infiltrate particle size, the total and percolated quantities of the three-phase boundary length and infiltrate surface area, and the tortuosity factor of the infiltrate network. This parametric study led to the following conclusions: (1) lowering the temperature can slow the degradation kinetics of triple-phase boundaries (TPB) and the surface area of the infiltrate particle; however, it can lead to a high level of tortuosity factor of the infiltrate network and slow the electrode reaction kinetics; (2) increasing the infiltration loading accelerates the coarsening rate of infiltrate particles; (3) increasing the wettability increases the coarsening rate of the infiltrate particles and decreasing rate of TPB; and (4) the tortuosity factor of the infiltrate network decreases with time and eventually attains stability. Eisele et al.
154
developed a DFT-based Metropolis MC (MMC) model to estimate the influence of defect interactions on the hydration of BZY. The results that were obtained concluded that the non-ideal experimental behavior for the varying yttrium fraction, proton fraction, and temperature were due to the ionic defect interactions. The DFT-based KMC model developed by Gomez et al.
155
showed that the proton conduction can be hampered by the presence of other protons. Using the thermogravimetric and a.c. impedance study, similar behavior was observed by Yamazaki et al.
156
.
KMC models usually use physical property data generated by DFT, MD, or experimental analyses. If inaccurate parameters are selected at the DFT level, then the output from the KMC studies will yield inaccurate results. In the case of a large number of variables confined to different constraints, KMC can be computationally inefficient.
Multiscale modeling
The operation of a cell depends on complex interactions between multi-physics, such as multi-phase fluid flow, mass transport, heat transfer, and electrochemical reactions. Multiscale modeling provides an opportunity to give a mechanistic description of material performance, and thus to guide optimization designs of material and structure. Therefore, handshaking of different length-scale studies, as observed in Fig.
7
, will improve the understanding of SOEC properties and their effects on the SOEC behavior.

developed a multiscale model combining DFT, transition state theory (TST), and continuum modeling for the oxygen-based reactions at the electrode to elucidate critical steps and predict device performance. The reaction rates predicted from TST were used as an input in the continuum model for obtaining overpotential-current density relations. The proposed multiscale model yields a quantitative agreement with the overpotential-current density data from the experiments. A new hybrid molecular-continuum model-pointwise coupling methodology was presented by Asproulis et al.
158
. The atomistic models were utilized to calculate transport properties, provide accurate boundary conditions, and substitute constitutive relations for the pressure among others, while the solution was advanced through the continuum solver. The calculation of the macroscopic variables was performed through averaging the corresponding microscopic properties. Ren et al.

investigated the effect of oxygen vacancy location on CO
2
reduction reaction at the three-phase boundary of Ni/samarium-doped ceria surface using DFT calculations. Moreover, based on the DFT results, the microkinetic model was developed to determine the rate-controlling step under different operating voltages at 1000 K. The results reveal that in case of interface oxygen vacancy, CO desorption is the rate-controlling step regardless of electrode overpotentials. However, in the case of non-interface oxygen vacancy, the rate-controlling step will change with an increase in cathode overpotential.
A multiscale approach was developed by Khaleel et al.
160
, in which the microscale electrochemistry model (e.g., Lattice-Boltzmann algorithm) calculates the performance of the porous electrode material based on the distribution of reaction surfaces, the material structure at the microstructure level, and the oxygen-ion transport through the material. The macroscale calculations (MARC software) were used to calculate the current density, cell voltage, and heat production after the microscale electrochemistry modeling has calculated the total fuel cell current-voltage relation.

Future perspectives and path forward
Despite the advantageous capabilities of SOECs for green H
2
production, its use is still limited on the industrial scale. The selections of materials for the cathode, anode, and electrolyte all play a crucial role in the performance of a cell. At the individual level, each component of the cell needs to be 100% effective and efficient to utilize the promising features of SOECs.
The main issue with electrolyte materials is current leakage due to a non-negligible electron conduction, which decreases faradaic efficiency. A computational model is a powerful tool that can be used to systematically study, analyze, and understand the problems related to current leakage within electrolytes. On the atomistic level, DFT studies can be performed to understand the surface chemistries and electron-hole mobility, which is directly related to current leakage. On the other hand, MD studies can be used to investigate the effect that temperature has on electron/hole formation, as well as mobility and bulk chemistries, by using methods that explicitly include electron/hole pair modeling such as AIMD and eReaxFF. Explicit electron/hole pair modeling also can be useful in understanding the factors affecting the faradaic efficiency of the cell and H
2
generation. In addition, MC simulations in combination with DFT/MD can be used to investigate the defect evolution and accumulation on a larger timescale. Finally, the multiscale modeling approach plays a significant role in understanding complex processes at a different length scale. The handshaking of a different length-scale study will help in solving the current problems like faradaic efficiency related to SOECs.
In addition to a different length-scale study, the implementation of parallel methods like the graphics processing unit in a different length-scale software package such as MD will help computational modelers in the future to simulate larger models. Incorporating the MGI database with machine learning techniques and data analysis will expedite the process of investigating and exploring new materials related to SOECs, which will significantly help the scientific community.

Abstract
Time-dependent density functional theory continues to draw a large number of users in a wide range of fields exploring myriad applications involving electronic spectra and dynamics. Although in principle exact, the predictivity of the calculations is limited by the available approximations for the exchange-correlation functional. In particular, it is known that the exact exchange-correlation functional has memory-dependence, but in practise adiabatic approximations are used which ignore this. Here we review the development of non-adiabatic functional approximations, their impact on calculations, and challenges in developing practical and accurate memory-dependent functionals for general purposes.

Introduction
Over the past almost 40 years, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has enabled the calculation of electronic spectra and dynamics in systems that would have been otherwise out of reach to treat quantum-mechanically

,

,

,

,

,

. While ground-state density functional theory (DFT) is the mainstay of electronic structure, being itself the most widely-used method for materials and molecules as well as the starting point of almost all other treatments of materials, it does not give excitations, or more generally the response to a time-dependent external field whether weak or strong. DFT-flavored methods that do provide excitation energies include ΔSCF
7
which, while originally justified only for the lowest state of a given symmetry, was later shown to have a rigorous basis through the generalized adiabatic connection approach of ref.
8
; the method however is usually used in a very approximate way with ground-state DFT functionals replacing approximations to the orbital-dependent excited state functionals appearing in the theory. Ensemble-DFT
9
,
10
,
11
, recently extensively reviewed in ref.
12
, provides another in-principle exact route to excitation energies, but existing formulations of either ensemble-DFT or ΔSCF do not give access to other response properties such as spectral oscillator strengths. Alternative methods based on approximations to the true wavefunction, or on other reduced quantities such as the one-body Green’s function or reduced density-matrices, require more computational resources. There are simply no computationally feasible alternatives to TDDFT for some of the applications on complex systems particularly when driven away from their ground states. Some examples over the past 5 years are described in recent reviews

The computational efficiency of TDDFT is all the more appreciated considering the climate crisis we face today. Instead of simulating the many-electron interacting TDSE, the Runge–Gross theorem
1
,
2
,
3
assures us that we can, in theory, find the exact time-dependent density and all observables from solving the time-dependent Kohn–Sham (KS) equation:
$$\left(-{\nabla }^{2}/2+{v}_{{{{\rm{S}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\right){\phi }_{i}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=i\partial {\phi }_{i}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)/\partial t$$
(1)
(in atomic units) where the KS potential is:
$${v}_{{{{\rm{S}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)={v}_{{{{\rm{ext}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)+{v}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}}[n]({{{\bf{r}}}},t)+{v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[n;{\Psi }_{0},{\Phi }_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}},t)$$
(2)
Here:
$${v}_{{{{\rm{H}}}}}[n]({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=\int\,{d}^{3}{r}^{{\prime} }w(| {{{\bf{r}}}}-{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }| )n({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },t)$$
(3)
is the Hartree potential,
$$\begin{array}{ll}n({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\,=\,N\mathop{\sum}\limits_{\sigma ,{\sigma }_{2}..{\sigma }_{N}}\displaystyle\int\,{d}^{3}{r}_{2}..{r}_{N}| \Psi ({{{\bf{r}}}}\sigma ,{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2}{\sigma }_{2}..{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{N}{\sigma }_{N}){| }^{2}\\ \qquad\quad=\,\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i}^{N}| {\phi }_{i}({{{\bf{r}}}},t){| }^{2}\end{array}$$
(4)
is the one-body density, and
\(w(| {{{\bf{r}}}}-{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }| )\)
the electron-electron interaction. The last term in Eq. (
2
) is the time-dependent exchange-correlation (xc) potential,
v
XC
[
n
; Ψ
0
, Φ
0
](
r
,
t
): a functional of the density, the initial interacting wavefunction Ψ
0
and initial choice of KS wavefunction Φ
0
. Solving for
N
single-particle orbitals scales far better with system-size than solving for Ψ, the correlated wavefunction of
N
electrons. In linear response applications, a perturbative limit of these equations gives the density response, from which excitation spectra can be extracted; there, instead of
v
XC
, its functional derivative, the xc kernel
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },t-{t}^{{\prime} })\)
is required. What makes this reformulation of many-electron dynamics possible is the Runge–Gross theorem proving the one-to-one mapping between the density and potential for a fixed initial state
1
, and the assumption of non-interacting
v
-representability
39
. (We note that the rigorous mathematical foundations of both aspects are somewhat unsettled
40
,
41
).
The Runge–Gross theorem guarantees that all observables, beyond just the time-dependent density, can be accessed with knowledge of the corresponding functional of the density and initial KS state. However, the identification of these functionals for observables not directly expressed in terms of the density is a challenging problem that has only been examined in a limited number of studies
42
,
43
,
44
. In practice, an approximation is made by using the KS wavefunction directly. We also note that the theorem holds for the density, but can be generalized to spin-densities, and in practice spin-densities are often used especially when properties related to magnetization are of interest.
A key element in these calculations is the xc potential,
v
XC
[
n
; Ψ
0
, Φ
0
](
r
,
t
), which is unknown and needs to be approximated. Almost all the calculations today use an adiabatic approximation; that is, a ground-state xc potential evaluated on the instantaneous density. Digging into the theory however reveals that the exact xc potential has memory-dependence: it depends on the history of the density,
\(n({{{\bf{r}}}},{t}^{{\prime} }\le t)\)
as well as the initial interacting and KS states, Ψ
0
and Φ
0
. In the linear response regime, memory-dependence endows the xc kernel with a frequency-dependence. Ever since the early days of TDDFT, researchers have been striving to build approximations which include this memory-dependence. Here, we review these efforts and their successes, reasons for why they are not widely used, and discuss prospects of future developments. Before doing so, we demonstrate, using an exactly-solvable model system, the implications of memory-dependence for both dynamics and excitations, and discuss some exact conditions related to memory dependence.
Significance of memory-dependence
The lack of memory-dependence in adiabatic TDDFT has been held responsible for errors in their predictions for many real systems, and sometimes significant failures, e.g. refs.
44
,
45
,
46
,

,
52
,
53
,
54
,
55
,
56
,
57
. In practise, an adiabatic approximation has two sources of error: one coming from the choice of the ground-state approximation, and one from making the adiabatic approximation itself. In some cases, the spatial non-local property of the xc functional is more important, and is lacking in the commonly used local or semi-local approximations, e.g., for excitons
58
, and some charge-transfer excitations
59
,
60
, and including long-range dependence yields good results even within an adiabatic approximation. But in other cases, memory-dependence is essential in both real-time non-perturbative dynamics and in linear response, as in refs.
22
,

,
45
,
46
,
47
,

,

,

,
52
,
53
,
54
,
55
,
56
,
57
. In the real-time regime, adiabatic functionals cannot describe resonantly-driven dynamics, or dissipation and relaxation from electron-electron interaction in large systems, for example. To isolate the effect of the lack of memory-dependence alone, a useful tool is to consider the adiabatically-exact approximation
4
,
61
,
62
, which consists of using the exact ground-state (g.s.) approximation:
$${v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{A}}-{\rm{ex}}}}}[{n};\Psi _0,\Phi _0]({{{\bf{r}}}},{t})={v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{exact}}\,{\rm{g.s.}}}}}[{n}(t)]({{{\bf{r}}}})$$
(5)
The “best” adiabatic approximation possible is then to propagate with
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{A-ex}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\)
, which would require finding the exact g.s. xc potential at each instant in time. This is numerically quite demanding for all but the simplest systems but very instructive when carried out
62
,
63
,
64
,
65
,
66
, especially when the resulting density and xc potential can be compared with the exact time-dependent density and xc potential. Finding the latter for a given target density can be generally achieved through iteration procedures
40
,
67
,
68
,
69
,
70
,
71
, or more simply for two-electron cases with only one doubly-occupied KS orbital, e.g. refs.
72
,
73
,
74
,
75
,
76
. Section “Example: asymmetric Hubbard dimer” gives an example on a very simple system, comparing propagation with the adiabatically-exact xc potential against the exact propagation.
In the linear response regime, the KS spectrum is corrected toward that of the true spectrum through the xc kernel which is the density-functional-derivative of the xc potential
26
,
27
(section “Non-adiabatic approximations in TDDFT”). The adiabatic approximation yields a frequency-independent kernel, but the frequency-dependence of the exact xc kernel is crucial to capture certain properties: for example, states of double-excitation character in molecules
45
,
77
, corrections to the band gap in semiconductors to which the mere KS gap gives an underestimate
78
,
79
unless hybrid functionals within generalized KS are used, and the excitonic Rydberg series in semiconductors
80
. The
exact
xc kernel has been found by inversion in a few works
81
,
82
,
83
, and recently, the general pole structure of the kernel was related to zeros in the density response from counterbalancing behavior of neighboring oscillatory modes, allowing a parametric reconstruction of the kernel
80
.
Example: asymmetric Hubbard dimer
To demonstrate the impact of the adiabatic approximation, we consider one of the simplest interacting two-electron systems, the Hubbard dimer:
$$H=-t\mathop{\sum}\limits_{\sigma =\uparrow ,\downarrow }({a}_{1\sigma }^{{\dagger} }{a}_{2\sigma }+{a}_{2\sigma }^{{\dagger} }{a}_{1\sigma })+U\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i}{\hat{n}}_{i\uparrow }{\hat{n}}_{i\downarrow }+\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i}{v}_{i}{\hat{n}}_{i}$$
(6)
where
t
is a site-to-site hopping parameter,
U
is an on-site interaction strength, and Δ
v
=
∣
v
1
−
v
2
∣
controls the asymmetry of the two-site system. This has been thoroughly studied in the ground state, see ref.
84
for a review which also provides a parametrization of the exact ground-state xc potential for this system, tuning the correlation, and examines limiting cases such as the symmetric limit, and the weakly- or strongly-correlated limits. As emphasized in ref.
84
, while the study of lattice models is insightful and shares features similar to real-space systems, it is not representative of most TDDFT applications which are done in real-space. Depending on the physical system at hand, the reduction of dimensionality and local nature of the interaction may be valid approximations
85
. The key parameter in determining the degree of correlation is the ratio of the asymmetry to the on-site interaction, Δ
v
/
U
84
,
86
; even for large interaction strengths
U
, the system is weakly correlated (meaning, the next lowest energy determinants to the KS ground-state determinant are not “nearby”) if the asymmetry Δ
v
is large enough that two electrons essentially sit on the same site in the ground state. Ref.
86
focuses on the exact features of the xc kernel in the same system.
Since only three singlet states span the Hilbert space, the ground-state Levy constrained search over all wavefunctions can be readily performed numerically given a target density
64
,
65
,

. This means that, at each time-step, it is straightforward to find the adiabatically-exact xc potential and use it to propagate to the next time-step. In this way, we can directly isolate the effect of making the adiabatic approximation on the dynamics, without any approximation to the ground-state functional.
Figure
1
shows the dynamics driven out of the ground-state by a
π
-pulse resonant with the lowest excitation, for parameters
t
= 1/2, Δ
v
= − 15, and either
U
= 10, or
U
= 20 in the strong correlation case. In either case, this excitation has a charge transfer character with respect to the ground state: for
U
= 10 the ground state has close to two electrons sitting on the lower site, while the lowest excitation has one electron transferred to the other site, while for
U
= 20 (Mott–Hubbard regime), the ground-state has close to one electron on each state while the lowest excitation has close to two electrons on the lower site. Driving the Hubbard dimer initially in its ground state with a weak
π
-pulse at this lowest excitation energy thus shows a large change in the site occupation Δ
n
=
n
1
−
n
2
as shown in the left panels of Fig.
1
. In both cases, the adiabatically-exact evolution shows only a small partial charge transfer (particularly small in the strongly correlated case) before returning to oscillate around the ground state density. This failure can be traced to the inability of the adiabatically-exact xc potential to capture dynamical step features
72
, in particular, a non-adiabatic step feature associated with charge-transfer
59
,
65
,
66
,
73
, evident in the oscillations and large change in the xc potentials shown on the right-hand-side; a full discussion of the xc potentials and densities in similar dynamics (using a continuous wave flat envelope driving instead of a
π
-pulse) can be found in refs.
65
,
66
. The dynamics seen here is very similar to that found in real molecules
47
where adiabatic approximations also began to charge transfer and then appeared to give up (see also Fig.
3
) shortly; the fact that even the adiabatically-exact fails indicates it is an issue with memory-dependence.

As mentioned above, the problem can be traced to the lack of dynamical steps and peaks in the xc potential, and this appears to especially drastically affect resonant-driving because it leads to spurious pole-shifting: when driven away from its ground-state, the resonant frequencies of a system predicted by adiabatic TDDFT are detuned from the values predicted from linear response of the ground-state
50
,
102
but excitation energies of a system should not shift with the instantaneous state (see also Fig.
3
shortly). The density-dependence of the KS potential results in the response of a general state having spuriously shifted poles, while the exact generalized xc kernel acquires a frequency-dependence that corrects this shift
102
,
103
. Adiabatic TDDFT is trying to predict resonantly-driven dynamics but keeps being driven out of resonance by the density-dependence. In fact, one could obtain a larger charge-transfer by instead applying a “chirped” laser that has a time-dependent frequency that adjusts to the instantaneous resonant frequency of the adiabatic approximation during the driving
103
. In general, the spurious pole-shifting can muddy the interpretation of the underlying dynamics of molecules when properties of the time-resolved dynamics are measured by a probe; the shifts of peaks in the experimental time-resolved spectrum correspond to different nuclear configurations, while in an adiabatic TDDFT simulation it would be hard to disentangle this from the spurious peak-shifting.
Ref.
104
argued for the case of using the linear-response TDDFT formulation of Ehrenfest dynamics rather than a real-time formulation due to this problem when simulating coupled electron-nuclear dynamics. This was demonstrated using a model system to compute the errors in predicting the underlying nuclear dynamics when the spectra are calculated in either formulation. An analog of this molecular dynamics situation for the Hubbard molecule is demonstrated in Fig.
2
, where the system under the same
π
-pulse as in Fig.
1
is probed at various times during the pulse by a weak pulse that measures the spectrum at that time. Note that the field is off during the probe measurement, so the exact absorption spectrum should have peaks at the same frequency each time, albeit with different oscillator strength. This condition is not respected by the adiabatically-exact propagation, as evident in the middle panel. The table gives the values of the peak frequencies at the times indicated during the evolution, exact and predicted from the adiabatically-exact evolution, and the external potential
v
ext
(
ω
AE
) whose linear response from the ground-state lies at the dominant peak in the exact and adiabatically-exact calculations. At
\({{{\mathcal{T}}}}=0\)
, there is a small difference between the adiabatically-exact and exact transition frequency. Even though the targeted single excitation is far from the doubly-excited state, a small amount of mixing still occurs and its contribution is hidden in the frequency-dependent part of the xc kernel that is neglected in the adiabatic propagation.

U
= 10 case): at the times
\({{{\mathcal{T}}}}\)
indicated during the dynamics in the top panels of Fig.
1
, the field is turned off and the system is probed to measure its absorption spectrum.
The top figure shows the exact, the middle shows the predictions from the adiabatically-exact approximation demonstrating the peak-shifting, while the table shows the predictions of the external potential values that would be deduced by comparing the peak position to frequencies predicted from linear response.

Leaving now the Hubbard playground and returning to real systems, Fig.

shows a sampling of results on molecular or solid-state systems where errors due to the adiabatic approximation lead to significant errors in their predictions of dynamics or spectra.

: time evolution of the dipole moment and energies computed with different methods. The frequency and strength of the pulse are adjusted to represent a resonant single-photon absorption in each case. The adiabatic LDA and PBE functionals are not able to transfer a significant amount of the charge in contrast to the configuration-interaction singles (CIS) and CIS-doubles (CISD) calculations. Analysis on a model system showed that the exact xc potential develops non-adiabatic step and peak features essential in the charge-transfer process

The position of the peaks should not change in the exact system, but peak shifting happens due to the adiabatic nature of LDA and X3LYP functionals.

have been accurate enough to reveal useful information about electron dynamics. Why this is so, is only partially understood; it is likely that few-electron, few-state systems are the most challenging cases for TDDFT and that often real systems are complex and large enough that e.g., peaks have significant widths and blur some of the problems discussed here. It is also true that in some applications the dominant effect driving the dynamics is the external potential, and the essential role of the xc potential is to partially counter self-interaction in the Hartree-potential and that a ground-state description of this is adequate. Further, often the observables of interest in real systems involve averaged quantities (e.g., the dipole moment rather than the spatially-resolved electron density) that can forgive even relatively large local errors in the density
105
. In situations where the system does not begin in a ground-state, it has been argued that the adiabatic approximation is likely to work best when the KS initial state is chosen to have a similar configuration as that of the true initial state
105
,
106
,
107
, and that if, in the true problem the natural orbital occupation numbers do not significantly evolve even as the natural orbitals themselves may evolve significantly, then the adiabatic approximation can be justified to do a reasonable job even for strongly perturbed dynamics
105
. A final consideration is that the adiabatic approximation, by virtue of not having any memory-dependence, in fact satisfies a number of exact conditions that are related to memory (section “Memory-related exact conditions”).
Memory-related exact conditions
We note that some insight into the structure of the exact xc potential can be gained from an exact expression resulting from equating the Heisenberg equation of motion for the second time-derivative of the density of the KS system to that of the interacting system

where the interaction component

satisfies:
$$\nabla \cdot (n({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\nabla {v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{W}({{{\bf{r}}}},t))=\nabla \cdot \left[n({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\int\,{n}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },{{{\bf{r}}}},t)\nabla w(| {{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }-{{{\bf{r}}}}| ){d}^{3}{r}^{{\prime} }\right],$$

(10)
where the two-body reduced density-matrix (2RDM) is:
$${\rho }_{2}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1}^{{\prime} },{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2}^{{\prime} })=N(N-1)\int\,d{r}_{3}..d{r}_{N}{\Psi }^{* }({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1}^{{\prime} },{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2}^{{\prime} },{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{3},..,{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{N})\Psi ({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{3},..,{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{N}).$$

The one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) is:

and
ρ

is the 1RDM of the KS system.
Through Eqs. (
7
)–(
9
), the dependence on the history of the density
\(n({t}^{{\prime} } <\, t)\)
and the full interacting and KS initial states Ψ(0) and Φ(0) is transformed into a more time-local dependence on the KS 1RDM, the true 1RDM, and the xc hole. It has been argued that adiabatic approximations tend to make less error on
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{W}\)
because the spatial integral appearing there is somewhat forgiving, while
\({v}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}^{T}\)
is responsible for the dominant non-adiabatic effects, including the dynamical steps and peak structures
69
,
74
,
105
,
109
. Further, the choice of initial KS state has a key effect on the size of
\({v}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}^{T}\)
, as evident from its dependence on the difference between the interacting and KS 1RDMs; as mentioned earlier, a judicious choice can ease the job of the xc functional approximation. Attempts to build a memory-dependent functional based on this decomposition will be discussed in the section “Density-matrix coupled approximations”.
Several of the known exact conditions for the ground-state xc functional have analogs in the time-dependent case, e.g., one-electron self-interaction-free conditions (

But there are also exact conditions that are inherently associated with the time-dependence of the system, and these typically have implications for memory-dependence of the functional. Here we briefly discuss two of the conditions that have been key ingredients in the development of non-adiabatic approximations, and refer the reader to refs.

in functional approximations leads to increased accuracy and reliability of the TDDFT predictions: Although their importance depends on the type of system of interest (e.g., finite-sized molecule versus extended solid) and the type of dynamics (mere spectra versus far from equilibrium), they can be responsible for errors in functionals that do not satisfy them, and can lead to violation of basic quantum principles e.g., unphysical self-excitation

Zero force theorem
The zero force theorem
111
,
115
,
116
,
117
(ZFT) ensures that the xc potential does not exert a net force:
$$\int\,n({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\nabla {v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[n;{\Psi }_{0},{\Phi }_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}},t){d}^{3}r=0.$$
(13)
Since the net force exerted by the Hartree potential vanishes, Eq. (
13
) ensures that the inter-electron Coulomb interaction does not exert any force on the system (as in Newton’s third law of classical mechanics). This also holds in the ground-state, but in the time-dependent case violation of this condition has a particularly severe consequence, leading to numerical instabilities due to the system self-exciting over time
114
,
118
,
119
. The linear response limit of Eq. (
13
) reveals a deep connection between spatial- and time- non-local density-dependence, which we will return to in the section “Finite-frequency LDA”.

Generalized translational invariance
Translational invariance requires the wavefunction in an accelerated, or “boosted“, frame to transform as:
$$\left\vert {\Psi }^{{{{\bf{b}}}}}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1}...{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{N},t)\right\rangle =\mathop{\prod }\limits_{j=1}^{N}{e}^{-i{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{j}\cdot \dot{{{{\bf{b}}}}}(t)}\left\vert \Psi ({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1}+{{{\bf{b}}}}(t)...{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{N}+{{{\bf{b}}}}(t),t)\right\rangle$$
(15)
where
b
(
t
) is the position of the accelerated observer and
\({{{\bf{b}}}}(0)=\dot{{{{\bf{b}}}}}(0)=0\)
such that the accelerated and inertial systems coincide at the initial time. The boosted density transports rigidly:
$${n}^{{{{\bf{b}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=n({{{\bf{r}}}}+{{{\bf{b}}}}(t),t).$$
(16)
Ref.
117
proved that in order to fulfill Eq. (
16
) the xc potential must transform as:
$${v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\bf{b}}}}}[n;\Psi_0,\Phi_0]({{{\bf{r}}}},t)={v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[n;\Psi_0,\Phi_0]({{{\bf{r}}}}+{{{\bf{b}}}}(t),t)\,.$$
(17)
In fact, a
v
XC
that fulfills Eq. (
17
) automatically fulfills the ZFT Eq. (
13
)
117
. The generalized translational invariance (GTI) and ZFT are closely related, particularly in the linear response regime
125
. A special case of Eq. (
17
) is the harmonic potential theorem (HPT), which states that for a system confined by a harmonic potential and subject to a uniform time-dependent electric field, the density transforms rigidly following Eq. (
16
) where
b
(
t
) is the position of the center of mass

Non-adiabatic approximations in TDDFT
From soon after the birth of TDDFT to today, non-adiabatic approximations have been derived and tested. We review these, in roughly chronological order, below. The earliest ones focussed on the linear response regime, where instead of needing an approximation for the full xc potential
v
XC
[
n
; Ψ
0
, Φ
0
](
r
,
t
), an approximation for the xc kernel
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },t-{t}^{{\prime} })=\frac{\delta {v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)}{\delta n({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },{t}^{{\prime} })}\)
, or its frequency Fourier transform is needed
26
,
27
,
127
. The TDDFT linear response formalism is based on the density-density response function,
\(\chi ({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\)
which describes the linear density response of the system at frequency
ω
to a perturbation
δ
v
:
\(\delta n({{{\bf{r}}}},\omega )=\int\,d{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }\chi ({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\delta v({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\)
. In TDDFT:
$$\begin{array}{ll}\chi ({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\,=\,{\chi }_{{{{\rm{S}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\\ \qquad \qquad\quad \,\,+\,\displaystyle\int\,d{r}_{1}d{r}_{2}{\chi }_{{{{\rm{S}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1},\omega ){f}_{{{{\rm{HXC}}}}}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2},\omega )\chi ({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\end{array}$$
(18)
where
χ
S
is the KS density-response function, giving the density-response to a perturbation of the KS potential
v
S
, and
\({f}_{{{{\rm{HXC}}}}}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2},\omega )=\frac{1}{| {{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1}-{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2}| }+{f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{1},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{2},\omega )\)
. Being evaluated at the ground-state density eliminates the initial-state dependence, due to the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem of ground-state DFT
128
, and memory-dependence corresponds to frequency-dependence of the xc kernel, since
\(\frac{\delta {v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)}{\delta n({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },{t}^{{\prime} })}\)
is not merely proportional to a delta-function in the time-difference which gives a constant in the frequency Fourier transform. The instantaneous dependence of the xc potential with respect to the density in the adiabatic approximation yields a frequency-independent kernel.
Finite-frequency LDA
The Gross–Kohn (GK) approximation
127
,
129
is a straightforward first attempt to extend the LDA into the dynamical regime, retaining the spatially-local dependence on the density while introducing time-nonlocal dependence via the finite-frequency response of a uniform electron gas. That is, the xc kernel is approximated by:
$${f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{GK}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )=\delta ({{{\bf{r}}}}-{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }){f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[{n}_{0}({{{\bf{r}}}})](q=0,\omega )$$
(19)
where
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[n](q,\omega )=\int\,{f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[n]({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega ){e}^{i{{{\bf{q}}}}\cdot ({{{\bf{r}}}}-{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} })}d{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }\)
is the xc kernel of a uniform electron gas of ground-state density
n
at wavevector
q
and frequency
ω
. The time-nonlocal dependence of the GK approximation is explicit when considering the response xc potential in the linear response regime corresponding to Eq. (
19
):
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{GK}}}}}[n]({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=\int\,{f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[{n}_{0}({{{\bf{r}}}})](t-{t}^{{\prime} })\delta n({{{\bf{r}}}},{t}^{{\prime} })d{t}^{{\prime} }\)
.
The uniform electron gas xc kernel,
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[n](q,\omega )\)
is known exactly for a range of densities in some limits, e.g., in the long-wavelength limit
q
= 0,
ω
≠ 0 in refs.
127
,
130
, and the static limit
q
≠ 0,
ω
= 0 in refs.
131
,
132
where parameterizations based on quantum Monte Carlo have been developed in ref.
133
. An early interpolation between the two limits was given in ref.
134
focussing on the metallic density range. More recently, ref.
135
developed an interpolation over a wide range of densities while incorporating first-principles constraints, with ref.
136
building upon this, embracing even lower densities and more exact conditions. We note that taking the limit
ω
→ 0 first then
q
→ 0 of the kernel reduces to the adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA). The order in which the limits
q
→ 0 and
ω
→ 0 are taken is crucial, as the outcome depends on their order
78
,
125
. It should also be noted that a fundamental difference between the uniform gas kernel and that of inhomogenous systems is the long-wavelength finite-frequency behavior as
q
→ 0, where
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}(q\to 0,\omega )\)
tends to a finite constant, while for non-metallic systems, the kernel diverges as
α
(
ω
)/
q
2
which has important consequences for the optical response of solids
3
,
58
,
137
(see also section “Bootstrapping many-body perturbation theory”). Finally, we note that ref.
138
tabulated
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[n](q,\omega )\)
for a wide range of wave-vectors and frequencies through a correlated equations of motion approach including single-particle-hole and two-particle two-hole excitations, within a correlated basis functions formalism for computing matrix elements. This revealed a double-plasmon excitation for which such a non-adiabatic kernel is essential (c.f. section “Specific cases”), and ref.
138
further showed the possibility of using these results to obtain such features in spectra of inhomogeneous systems.
Returning to the GK approximation, Eq. (
19
) can be viewed as a “double LDA”, in that both the ground-state density of the system
n
0
(
r
) varies slowly enough in space that the density-functional argument can be replaced by the local density considered as part of a homogeneous system, and also that the response of the system varies slowly enough that only the zero wavevector component is used.
A question is whether an approximation may still be reasonably accurate well beyond the situation for which it was derived, as is the case for the ground-state LDA. In the ground-state case, a key reason often given for why LDA gives useful results for non-uniform densities of molecules and solids is its satisfaction of exact conditions
139
,
140
such as sum-rules on the xc hole. Unfortunately, the GK approximation violates several of the exact conditions discussed in the section “Memory-related exact conditions” that are important for the time-dependent problem. Refs.
117
,
126
pointed out that it violates the HPT: instead of yielding a rigid sloshing of the density in a uniform field-driven harmonic well with a center that follows the classical center of mass motion, GK results in a density-dependent shift in the frequency of this motion, and a damping of the oscillations. The problem is that a potential
v
XC
(
r
,
t
) that sees only the density at that point
r
over time cannot tell whether the change over time is from a sloshing motion or a compression/expansion motion.
In fact, GK’s violation of the GTI condition, of which HPT is a special case, was shown in refs.
116
,
117
to imply that the xc kernel for a non-uniform system at finite frequency has a density-dependence that is long-range in space such that a local-density or gradient expansion approximation simply does not exist. The ZFT also demonstrates this: taking the linear-response limit of Eq. (
13
) by writing
n
(
r
,
ω
) =
n
0
(
r
) +
n
1
(
r
,
ω
) and
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},\omega )={v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}})+\int\,{f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega ){n}_{1}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega ){d}^{3}{r}^{{\prime} }\)
, one arrives at:
$$\int\,{f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega )\nabla {n}_{0}({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }){d}^{3}{r}^{{\prime} }=\nabla {v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[{n}_{0}]({{{\bf{r}}}})$$
(20)
Inputting the GK kernel Eq. (
19
) yields
\(\nabla {n}_{0}({{{\bf{r}}}}){f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{unif}}}}}[{n}_{0}({{{\bf{r}}}})](q=0,\omega )\)
on the left-hand-side, which is a clearly frequency-dependent quantity, quite incompatible with the right-hand-side which is frequency-independent! The argument can be generalized to show that even a short-ranged xc kernel violates the condition when applied to slowly-varying ground-state densities, and that
\(\int\,{f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },\omega ){d}^{3}{r}^{{\prime} }\)
must diverge. In fact, Eq. (
20
) implies that spatial and time non-local density-dependence are intimately related in the exact xc kernel, since the spatial integral of the frequency-dependence must yield a frequency-independent quantity. Thus the ZFT, which is a seemingly natural statement embodying simply a Newton’s third law type of physics leads to quite an extraordinary result: time non-local density-dependence implies spatially non-local dependence, and that a local-density approximation, or gradient expansion, with memory simply does not exist
125
,
141
. Since this is true even in the limit of slowly-varying densities, the effect has been dubbed “ultra-nonlocality”.
The effect of the violation of the GTI and ZFT by the GK approximation on dynamics was shown to yield unphysical behavior on dynamics in sodium clusters in ref.
118
, including the appearance of spurious low-frequency modes and instabilities. Ref.
118
also presented a way to directly impose these conditions through constraints on the potentials, applicable in principle to any xc kernel or potential approximation.
Time-dependent current-density functional theory
While ref.
126
pointed out GK’s violation of the HPT theorem, it also suggested an avenue for a remedy: to separate out the translational motion of the density from that of the compression/expansion and to use the finite-frequency uniform-gas kernel only for the latter. Ref.
142
further developed this notion that memory resides with a “fluid element” and that, although there is no spatially-local time-nonlocal description in terms of
n
(
r
,
t
), we can search for such a description in terms of
\(n({{{\bf{R}}}}({t}^{{\prime} }))\)
where
\({{{\bf{R}}}}({t}^{{\prime} })={{{\bf{R}}}}({t}^{{\prime} }| {{{\bf{r}}}}t)\)
is the position of the fluid element at time
\({t}^{{\prime} }\)
which at
t
is at position
r
. In this way, the current-density naturally enters the picture because this is what dictates the trajectory
R
(
t
), through
\({\partial }_{{t}^{{\prime} }}{{{\bf{R}}}}({t}^{{\prime} }| {{{\bf{r}}}},t)={{{\bf{J}}}}({{{\bf{R}}}},{t}^{{\prime} })/n({{{\bf{R}}}},{t}^{{\prime} })\)
with the boundary condition
R
(
t
∣
r
,
t
) =
r
. The Dobson–Bünner–Gross functional thus applies the GK functional in a frame that moves with the local velocity
\({{{\bf{J}}}}({{{\bf{R}}}},{t}^{{\prime} })/n({{{\bf{R}}}},{t}^{{\prime} })\)
, resulting in a functional that satisfies the HPT and GTI
142
.
At around the same time (in fact the “received” date is earlier for ref.
142
than for ref.
143
although the “published” date is after), the Vignale–Kohn current-density functional was developed, which elevated the current-density from simply assisting to actually being the basic variable of the functional
125
,
143
,
144
. Time-dependent current-density functional theory (TDCDFT) is based on the one-to-one mapping between the current-density and the vector potential acting on the system, for a given initial state, which had been proven earlier in refs.
145
,
146
. The KS equation has the form:
$$\left(\frac{{(-i\nabla +{{{{\bf{a}}}}}_{{{{\rm{S}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t))}^{2}}{2}+{v}_{{{{\rm{S}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\right){\phi }_{i}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=i{\partial }_{t}{\phi }_{i}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)$$
(21)
where there is a gauge-freedom between the longitudinal part of the KS vector potential and scalar potential, e.g., putting all the time-dependent external fields and xc fields into the vector potential would yield
a
S
(
r
,
t
) =
a

r

r
) +
v
H
(
r
,
t
) +
v
XC,0
(

), but other gauge choices can be made. Even if only a scalar potential is applied to an interacting system, the resulting current-density is typically only reproducible by a non-interacting system with a vector potential; the TDDFT KS current-density usually differs from the physical current-density by a rotational component, even when the exact xc functional is used
75
,
121
,
122
,
123
,
124
.
A key motivation for using TDCDFT is that the current-density at a given point in space contains spatially non-local density-dependence, which can be seen from inverting the continuity equation:
\(\nabla \cdot {{{\bf{j}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=-{\partial }_{t}n({{{\bf{r}}}},t)\to {{{{\bf{j}}}}}_{L}({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=\int\,{\partial }_{t}n({{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },t){\nabla }_{r}\frac{1}{4\pi | {{{\bf{r}}}}-{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} }| }{d}^{3}{r}^{{\prime} }\)
, which implies that spatially local functionals of the current-density have spatially non-local density-dependence. In fact a local approximation in terms of the current-density does exist, and, when considered through the linear current response of a slowly spatially-varying electron gas, forms the basis of the Vignale–Kohn (VK) approximation
125
,
141
,
143
,
144
. The central role is played by the tensorial xc kernel which is the functional derivative of the xc vector potential with respect to the current-density, for the ground-state of a slowly-varying periodically modulated electron gas. This functional is constructed in the linear response regime, built up from both longitudinal and transverse responses of the uniform electron gas
147
,
148
,
149
,
150
together with the imposition of several exact conditions: the zero force and zero torque identities (section “Memory-related exact conditions”), the Ward identity and symmetry/reciprocity relations
125
. The resulting functional for the linear response xc vector potential takes the following form
125
,
143
,
144
:
$$\frac{-i\omega }{c}{a}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}1,i}=-{\nabla }_{i}{v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}1}^{{{{\rm{ALDA}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}})+\frac{1}{{n}_{0}({{{\bf{r}}}})}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{j}\frac{\partial {\sigma }_{{{{\rm{XC}}}},ij}({{{\bf{r}}}},\omega )}{\partial {r}_{j}}$$
(22)
where:
$${\sigma }_{{{{\rm{XC}}}},ij}={\tilde{\eta }}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}\left(\frac{\partial {u}_{i}}{\partial {r}_{j}}+\frac{\partial {u}_{j}}{\partial {r}_{i}}-\frac{2}{3}\nabla \cdot {{{\bf{u}}}}{\delta }_{ij}\right)+{\tilde{\xi }}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}\nabla \cdot {{{\bf{u}}}}{\delta }_{ij}$$
(23)
where
u
=
j
(
r
)/
n
0
(
r
) is the velocity field, and
\(\tilde{\eta }\)
and
\({\tilde{\xi }}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}\)
are complex viscosity coefficients, expressible in terms of the longitudinal and transverse response kernels of the uniform electron gas, and functions of the frequency and ground-state density
125
,
143
,
144
. Although the original form looked more complicated, it was shown to be equivalent to the form above in ref.
144
, giving a physical interpretation in terms of a Navier–Stokes form for the current-density where a hydrodynamical viscoelastic stress tensor has complex viscosity coefficients of the electron liquid. The VK approximation becomes exact in the limit that the length scale of the variations of the ground-state density
q
−1
and perturbing potential
k
−1
are such that

q
< <
ω

F
,
k
F
where
k
F
,
v

are the local Fermi momentum and velocity . Therefore, this theory is applicable to the study of high frequency phenomena, but due to its satisfaction of some exact conditions and spatially-non-local density-dependence, it has also been successfully applied in the static regime where long-range effects are important (more shortly). It has also been extended to the non-linear regime in ref.
144
. Building on the VK approach, refs.
151
,
152
derived a GGA and meta-GGA to move beyond the slowly spatially-varying assumption.
The Vignale–Kohn approximation has memory-dependence and spatially nonlocal density-dependence (local in current). Due to these features, it has successfully predicted linewidths of collective modes in two-dimensional quantum strips and quantum wells
153
,
154
,
155

,
161
(routinely underestimated by adiabatic LDA or GGA). However, it has been shown to generate unphysical damping of excitations and dissipation in finite systems
162
, does not provide a significant correction to the band-gap, and does not work well for the optical response of semiconductors unless either an empirical factor is used
163
,
164
or it is combined with other non-empirical polarization functionals where it corrects for bound exciton widths in insulators and semiconductors and Drude tails in metals
165
. Even if only applied to metallic extended systems, some caution should be applied since the longitudinal and transverse electron gas response functions entering the Vignale–Kohn functional are not well-known for all frequencies and wavevectors
147
,
149
. The non-linear extension of the Vignale–Kohn approximation has also been used to study decoherence and energy relaxation of charge-density oscillations in quantum wells
166
. A different nonlinear non-adiabatic functional based on Landau Fermi liquid theory was presented in ref.
167
and was the precursor of deformation functional theory which will be shortly discussed.
TDCDFT via an action functional
TDCDFT was also the framework for a general formulation where memory is included through an action functional defined on the Keldysh contour in order to preserve causality
168
:
v
XC
should depend only on the past-density, not the future, which means its functional derivative
\({f}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[n]({{{\bf{r}}}},t-{t}^{{\prime} })\)
should be zero for
\(t > {t}^{{\prime} }\)
169
and this property would be violated if
v
XC
was the functional derivative of an action defined in physical time rather than on the Keldysh contour. (We note that some caution is needed when using the Keldysh contour in TDDFT: the Runge–Gross one-to-one mapping on the Keldysh contour has not yet been proven
120
but the contour can be still be used rigorously in variational formulations e.g., as demonstrated in ref.
170
). Regarding a real-time resolution of the causality paradox, we refer the reader to ref.
171
.
The use of Lagrangian coordinates in the action functional resulted in xc potentials that again preserve the GTI and ZFT
172
; the Lagrangian description arises naturally when thinking of the convective fluid element motion in TDCDFT. The same authors developed a computationally simpler approach that avoids Lagrangian frames, and instead constructs a family of translationally invariant actions on the Keldysh contour which automatically satisfy GTI and ZFT, and they derive a memory-correction to ALDA built using the uniform electron gas kernel of refs.
127
,
130
in this framework
168
. The effect of memory in this approximation was highlighted in creating viscous effects in both the linear and non-linear regime in plasmon dynamics and absorption in spherical jellium gold clusters.
Time-dependent deformation functional theory
When TDCDFT is recast in the Lagrangian frame, the natural spatial coordinate to use at time
t
becomes the initial point
ξ
=
ξ
(
r
,
t
) of the trajectory which at time
t
is at position
r
. Refs.
170
,
173
,
174
,
175
showed that by separating the convective motion of the “electron fluid elements” from their relative motion, the many-body effects are contained in an xc stress tensor which depends on the time-dependent metric tensor of the
r
→
ξ
transformation; since this tensor corresponds to Green’s deformation tensor of classical elasticity theory, the approach is called time-dependent deformation functional theory (TDdefFT). This framework is fully non-linear from the start and offers a distinct starting point for approximations. The local deformation approximation is based on uniform time-dependent deformations of the uniform gas, giving a stress tensor with spatially-local but time-non-local dependence on the metric tensor; this does not violate the ZFT and GTI since the convective non-locality is treated exactly through its dependence on the Lagrangian coordinate
ξ
(
r
,
t
). Ref.
176
compared TDdefFT and TDCDFT in both linear and nonlinear models of charge-density oscillations. In the limit of small deformations, the local approximation in TDdefFT reduces to the VK TDCDFT approximation
174
. Another limit is an elastic one, valid for very fast variations of the deformation tensor. This is spatially-nonlocal and related to the “antiadiabatic” limit of the xc kernel
177
. In “quantum continuum mechanics”
178
,
179
,
180
, the hydrodynamic picture has been applied directly to the many-body system without being propped up by a KS system.
Orbital functionals
Hydrodynamic methods that are based on xc effects of uniform or slowly-varying electron gases are problematic for finite systems, since they introduce spurious dissipation. A consequence in the linear response regime is that the predicted excitation energies of atoms and molecules attain an unphysical lifetime
162
. A different direction to incorporate memory and also spatial nonlocality is to develop explicit functionals of the KS orbitals
v
XC
[{
ϕ
i
}](
r
,
t
). Since each orbital itself depends on the density in a spatially and time non-local way, an explicit local functional of the orbital is an implicit non-local functional of the density. Some common orbital functionals are meta-GGAs, which are have semi-local spatial dependence on the orbitals, hybrids incorporating a fraction of exact exchange, and self-interaction corrected LDA; the latter two have non-local spatial dependence from Coulomb integrals between orbitals and so are computationally more expensive. The spatial non-locality enables various properties in TDDFT to be better reproduced for reasons unrelated to memory, e.g., capturing the −1/
r
asymptotic decay of
v
XC
which reclaims the Rydberg series of excitations in the bound spectrum that are otherwise lost in the continuum
181
, particle-number discontinuities in the xc kernel that are important in capturing charge-transfer excitations
182
, and ionization
62
. One advantage of these approaches is that self-interaction error is more easily dealt with, unlike in the hydrodynamic approaches in the section “Time-dependent current-density functional theory”.
There are two fundamentally different but formally rigorous ways in which to treat orbital functionals. In one, as in KS theory with explicit density-functionals, the xc potential is the same function for all orbitals, and, when the approximation enters through an xc action
A
XC
[{
ϕ
i
}], possibly on the Keldysh contour
169
,
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[\{{\phi }_{i}\}]({{{\bf{r}}}},t)=\frac{\delta {A}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}[\{{\phi }_{i}\}]}{\delta n({{{\bf{r}}}},t)}\)
is obtained through the time-dependent orbital effective potential equations (TDOEP)
183
. Exact exchange has been computed in this way
184
,
185
,
186
,
187
,
188
primarily in the linear response regime for the computation of excitation energies. For example, for long-range charge-transfer excitations between closed-shell fragments, the importance of derivative discontinuities of the xc kernel with respect to particle number was shown to play a key role, and the exact exchange kernel, due to its orbital dependence captures these, and yields the correct asymptotic behavior of these excitation energies when used in its fully non-adiabatic form
182
,
189
,
190
. A finite derivative discontinuity is related to correcting the self-interaction from the Hartree functional
191
, and self-interaction corrected LDA has also been applied within TDOEP
192
.
The second way to treat orbital functionals resulting from an action functional (or in the ground-state case an energy functional), is through the so-called generalized KS approach
193
,
194
,
195
, resulting in orbital-specific xc potentials. This avoids having to solve the numerically challenging TDOEP equation, and is the most common treatment of hybrid functionals where a fraction of Hartree–Fock exchange is mixed in. Hybrid functionals have some advantage in the ground-state in that the delocalization error of semi-local functionals is partially compensated by the localization error of Hartree–Fock
196
, but perhaps most interesting for TDDFT is that the meaning of the predicted excitations is fundamentally different for the pure KS treatment than for the generalized KS treatment. In the former, excitations are those of the neutral system, while in the latter, they have a character in between neutral and addition (or affinity) energies, depending on the amount of Hartree–Fock mixed in. This has proved particularly useful for charge-transfer excitation energies when range-separated hybrids are used
59
,
190
,
197
,
198
,
199
,
200
,
201
,
202
.
However, coming back to the theme of non-adiabaticity, without frequency-dependence, a general treatment of charge-transfer excitations in response and charge-transfer dynamics in real-time, are out of reach for hybrid functionals whether treated in generalized or pure KS. This can be most easily seen with the two-electron example, where ground-state exact exchange and Hartree–Fock exchange coincide, equaling minus half the Hartree potential: a frequency-independent xc kernel cannot properly describe excitations when there are KS determinants lying near the ground-state (also section “Specific cases”) as in the case of a stretched heteroatomic diatomic molecule
203
, and the non-adiabatic dynamical steps and peaks mentioned in the section “Significance of memory-dependence” necessary to achieve the transfer of an electron in real time are missing
59
,
73
.
There have been far fewer applications of orbital functionals in the nonlinear regime, largely because of the computational expense
51
,
192
,
204
,
205
. Applying the KLI approximation
206
simplifies the TDOEP calculation
183
,
207
,
208
but becomes problematic because of its violation of the ZFT which can result in unphysical self-excitation
114
.
Bootstrapping many-body perturbation theory
Noting that the density is the diagonal of the one-body Green’s function in the equal-time limit, an exact integral expression for the time-dependent xc potential can be found through the Dyson equation for the interacting Green’s function when referred to the KS Green’s function
209
. Taking place on a Keldysh pseudotime contour, this is the time-dependent generalization of the Sham–Schlüter approach
210
,
211
, and connects
v
XC
(
r
,
t
) to the two-point self-energy
\({\Sigma }_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}({{{\bf{r}}}},t;{{{{\bf{r}}}}}^{{\prime} },{t}^{{\prime} })\)
of many-body theory. Approximations derived from many-body diagrammatic expansions can thus be transformed into equivalent approximations for the TDDFT xc potential. These often result in orbital functionals with implicit density-dependence (section “Orbital functionals”). The first order in perturbation theory is the Hartree–Fock approximation for Σ
XC
which, through the time-dependent Sham–Schlüter equation yields the time-dependent exact exchange potential, while higher order perturbation theory introduces correlation. A diagrammatic expansion of the equation using the KS Green’s functions as the bare propagators showed that the spatial nonlocality of the xc kernel is strongly frequency-dependent, and related the long-ranged divergence at frequencies of excitation energies to the discontinuity of the xc potential
212
.
To ensure that the selection of diagrams respects fundamental conservation laws such as particle number, energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservations, instead a variational formalism similar to many-body perturbation theory
213
,
214
has been developed
215
. One defines a universal functional of the Green’s function for the non-classical electron interaction, of which the self-energy is the functional derivative. The total action (or energy, in the ground-state case) as a functional of the Green’s function then has its stationary point at the Green’s function that solves the Dyson equation with the consistent self-energy, and restricting the functional domain to that of Green’s functions arising from non-interacting Schrödinger equations with local multiplicative potentials, results in a procedure to obtain TDDFT approximations
215
. The linearized Sham–Schlüter equation, in which the Green’s function is replaced by the KS Green’s function everywhere, can be derived from such an approach.
Other work where TDDFT approximations have been derived from connections with many-body perturbation theory have been within the linear response regime, and largely focussed on non-metallic extended systems, using Bethe–Salpeter formalism
58
,
137
. The latter involves the four-point reducible polarizability which needs to be contracted to the two-point density-response function to relate to TDDFT; we refer the reader to ref.
58
for a review on different ways in which this has been achieved by different groups. In particular, for semiconductors, the exact xc kernel can be considered as a sum of two terms
216
,
217
: one that changes the KS band gap to the larger quasiparticle one, and the other that accounts for the electron-hole interaction responsible for excitonic effects. The first term is usually just accounted for by using the quasiparticle gap, without explicitly finding the kernel that opens the gap; non-adiabaticity is needed for the kernel to achieve this (see an argument by Vignale described in ref.
79
). For the second term, an expression was derived involving contractions over the quasiparticle polarizability, one-body interacting Green’s function and screened Coulomb interaction, and various approximations considered and tested
58
,
216
,
218
,
219
,
220
,
221
. From the point of view of non-adiabaticity, frequency-dependence was shown to arise out of the contractions over spatial indices, even when the many-body quantities being integrated over are frequency-independent
222
. The calculation of the two-particle matrix elements is expensive, and instead the separation has been exploited to define a two-part procedure to calculate accurate optical spectra of semiconductors and insulators from first-principles without any empirical parameters and without any calculations or input needed outside TD(C)DFT
223
: first, a modified KS response function is defined through an implicit kernel that accounts for the derivative discontinuity giving rise to gap-opening and second, a polarization functional from TDCDFT is applied for the part of the kernel that captures excitonic effects
165
. While spatially long-ranged behavior is essential for the latter, time-nonlocality (frequency-dependence) is implicitly contained in the former to open the gap.
Density-matrix coupled approximations
Another approach focusses on building approximations to the one-body and two-body reduced density-matrix (1RDM, 2RDM) that appear in an exact expression for the xc potential, Eq. (
7
). If the interacting 2RDM could be somehow modeled, it would provide the two ingredients in the exact
v
XC
of Eq. (
7
) that are not directly accessible from the TDKS evolution,
ρ
1
and
n
XC
. A particular class of such approximations, denoted “density-matrix coupled approximations”, couples the TDKS equations to the first equation in the BBGKY density-matrix hierarchy
67
,
105
. Unlike most of the previously-discussed approaches, this approach respects initial-state dependence in the sense that the xc potentials for identical density evolutions arising from different initial states will differ.
The simplest approximation would be to replace
ρ
1
and
n
XC
by their KS counterparts
69
,
74
,
107
,
109
,
204
,
224
, an approximation that we dub
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{S}}}}}\)
. Although
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{{{{\rm{S}}}}}\)
generally approximates the exact
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{W}\)
well, the kinetic component
\({v}_{{{{\rm{XC}}}}}^{T}\)
vanishes, but it is the kinetic component that contains the large dynamical step and peak features
76
(section “Significance of memory-dependence”) that are crucial to accurately capture dynamics in a number of situations, e.g., electron scattering
74
,
109
, charge-transfer out of a ground state
73
(see the example in the section “Significance of memory-dependence”), quasiparticle propagation through a wire
225
. Ref.
69
explored various “frozen” approximations, while ref.
67
presented an approach based on coupling the KS evolution to the first equation in the BBGKY hierarchy for the interacting 1RDM; the two equations “pass” back and forth an approximation for a fictitious
\({\tilde{\rho }}_{2}\)
as a functional of the 1RDM evolving from the BBGKY equation and the KS 1RDM evolving from the KS equation. This was shown to capture the dynamical steps and peaks, to satisfy the ZFT and GTI, and be self-interaction-free, however it becomes numerically unstable after too short times to be practical
67
,
105
. Whether instead a paradigmatic system can be found from which the interacting 1RDM can be obtained as a functional of KS-accessible quantities remains an open exploration.
Even if the choices made so far for the 2RDM have led to a numerically unstable approach, a question is whether they capture non-adiabatic features in the linear response domain related to phenomena such as double excitations. In particular, whether the kernel resulting from the functional derivative of
\({v}_{{{{\rm{C}}}}}^{{{{\rm{T}}}}}\)
gives an approximation to the pole in the exact kernel
77
that is responsible for the interaction of the singly and doubly-excited KS states underlying a state of double-excitation character (section “Specific cases”). This can be answered by deriving the linear response of the system starting with Eqs. (
9
) and (
8
) and transforming to the frequency-domain. In the KS basis, this creates a set of equations to solve to obtain a kernel
f
HXC
(
ω
) that can be used in Casida equations. Testing this approach on the model studied in ref.
77
, a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with delta-interacting electrons, with the choice of
\({\tilde{\rho }}_{2}\)
as the time-dependent KS one, yields mixed results as seen in Fig.
5
. A pole does indeed appear in the kernel, showing a strong non-adiabaticity in the matrix element of
f
HXC
associated with the state of double excitation character (upper panel). However, it has the wrong position, sign, and amplitude of the divergence. Moreover, a spurious pole also appears in the matrix element where the physical system only has a single excitation (lower panel). This shows the limitations of using
\(\tilde{\rho }_2={\rho }_{2{{{\rm{S}}}}}\)
within the density-matrix coupled scheme.

f
HXC

77

HXC
. Lower panel the matrix element corresponding to an uncoupled single excitation in the exact system.

Specific cases
While the previous sections propose universal xc functional approximations with memory, there have also been approximations derived for specific cases where memory is known to be important. We briefly mention some of these here.
As just discussed, the adiabatic approximation in linear response is unable to capture states with double excitation character
45
,
46
,
77
,
138
,
190
,
226
,
227
,
228
,
229
,
230
. These states can enter the spectrum even at low energies, e.g., in conjugated polyenes where they mix with the single excitations
46
, and they are typically sprinkled throughout the spectrum in geometries away from equilibrium. This poses a problem for the general reliability of TDDFT predictions of photoinduced dynamics where nuclei are driven to sample a range of configurations due to their coupling to the electronic motion. Inspired by the form of the exact xc kernel when a double excitation lies near a (group of) single excitation, ref.
77
derived a frequency-dependent approximation to be applied for this case. This “dressed” kernel has a pole in a frequency-range near the double excitation, and gave reasonable predictions for these states in a range of molecules
46
,
231
,
232
. In a related spirit, a frequency-dependent quadratic response kernel was recently derived in ref.
233
, which cures unphysical divergences arising in adiabatic TDDFT when the difference between two excitation energies equals another one
234
.
A non-adiabatic approximation was derived for the single-impurity Anderson model
95
,
235
, capturing the dynamical step feature missing in the adiabatic approximation, and applied to quantum transport. This functional depended only on the site occupation and its first time-derivative. Going from approximations on a lattice to real-space systems however is highly non-trivial: as mentioned in the section “Significance of memory-dependence” even the basic theorems and
v
-representability issues are distinct on a lattice than in real-space, and whether the former can be consistently converged to the latter is unclear.
Focussing on models where the ground-state is strongly-correlated, refs.

derived an xc functional approximation for the xc kernel of Hubbard model systems from dynamical mean field theory; these could be applied to a real system with Hubbard parameters chosen somehow from experiment. The non-adiabatic part of the resulting kernel is completely local in space but has memory-dependence, placing it at risk of violating the zero force and Galilean invariance principles discussed earlier.
Outlook
This review has focussed on non-adiabatic approximations to the xc potential or kernel, but other ingredients needed in TDDFT are functionals for the observables when the observables are not directly related to the density itself. For example, ionization probabilities
42
, momentum-distributions
43
, even simply the current-density whose rotational component is not generally reproduced by the TDKS system even if an exact xc functional is used
75
,
79
,
121
,
123
,
124
. Usually these observables are extracted simply by taking expectation values of their usual operators in the KS state, which inherently entails an approximation additional to that of the xc functional. Corrections to such observable-functionals and their memory-dependent properties are largely unexplored.
The studies in the past years on the exact xc potential and its properties, and the different efforts in development of memory-dependent functionals summarized here show that the search for an accurate and practical non-adiabatic approximation is a challenging one. The search is on-going and creative: several recent new directions not mentioned yet in this review have been proposed for time-dependent functional development which are still at a very preliminary stage, including coupling-constant integral transforms

,

, re-casting TDDFT using the second-time-derivative of the density as basic variable
238
, and extensions of the connector theory approach

,

to the time-domain. Whether one of these will yield an elixir remains to be seen, but even if not, they reveal interesting physics about the dynamics of electron correlation.

Abstract
It has proved challenging to represent the behavior of polymeric macromolecules as machine learning features for biomaterial interaction prediction. There are several approaches to this representation, yet no consensus for a universal representational framework, in part due to the sensitivity of biomacromolecular interactions to polymer properties. To help navigate the process of feature engineering, we provide an overview of popular classes of data representations for polymeric biomaterial machine learning while discussing their merits and limitations. Generally, increasing the accessibility of polymeric biomaterial feature engineering knowledge will contribute to the goal of accelerating clinical translation from biomaterials discovery.

Introduction
The selection of feature descriptors to encode a dataset for machine learning is one of the most important decisions underlying model quality, as different data representations can yield different interpretations of training data by the model
1
,
2
. With this, appropriate descriptors should be chosen with care and intention at the outset of a machine-learning project. Small molecules, as a function of their constrained sizes and structure, can be represented as standardized numeric descriptors for simulation, molecular property prediction, and virtual screening
3
. The ability to encode small molecules numerically in part provided an essential foundation for the chemoinformatics domain to achieve data-driven research success in small molecule drug discovery
4
.
Inspired by small molecule success, machine learning frameworks for studying polymers often use feature descriptors based on the attributes of drug-like small molecules
4
,
5
. The intrinsic limitation of applying small-molecule-based feature representations to biomaterials is that small molecule descriptors lack the ability to accommodate the heterogeneity of polymer properties, which are drawn from combinations of polymer chemical, physical, and topological attributes
3
,
6
. Further, alterations in these macromolecular properties can yield significant changes in predictive target outcomes, such as a polymer’s resulting interactions in biological media
7
. Similar examples including changes in polymer molecular weight, degree of polymerization, co-polymer, branching, chirality, nanostructure, synthesis technique, storage conditions, environmental conditions, polydispersity, and side chain regularity have all been shown to impact interaction outcomes
7
,
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
. In view of the limitations of small molecule descriptors for representing polymeric biomaterials, there is a clear need for dedicated macromolecular descriptors that facilitate the training of representative predictive models in this domain.
Unfortunately, it has proved challenging to generally represent the behavior of polymer biomaterials and their interactions with other biological macromolecules for machine learning. There are several popular approaches to polymer representation, including domain-specific descriptors, molecular fingerprints, string descriptors, and graph representations (Fig.
1
), albeit there is no recognized consensus for an optimal representation across the biomacromolecular problem spaces
5
,
7
,

,

16
. Where one size does
not
fit all, researchers must independently consider the attributes of their dataset and objectives of their research project to contextually identify how descriptors can positively drive their resulting model towards robust predictive performance, a process known in machine learning as feature engineering.

Feature engineering functions as a central pillar between data collection and modeling, hence careful consideration of descriptor frameworks can have dramatic influence on model performance.

Feature engineering encompasses refining and structuring raw input data into a relevant data structure that enables machine learning. Generally, this process is problem specific and relies heavily on domain (a priori) knowledge of a given problem. Domain knowledge guides the design and selection of features relevant to training accurate machine learning-based models. As an example, for polymer and biopolymer systems, variables such as molecular weight, degree of polymerization, and representation of the polymer sequence are often selected as features
17
. While it is possible to use these variables as a feature vector directly, the engineering process often involves some transformation to either improve machine readability or benefit predictive power. Examples include denoting presence or absence via one-hot encoding, binning a numerical value into categorical ranges, improving learning speed and preventing numerical overflow with scaling, or applying information compression algorithms such as principal component analysis or UMAP. Where deep learning algorithms are used, the input feature vector is again transformed through stacked layers of neurons, the ideal numbers of which vary in accordance with the dataset, and are optimized during the training process.
The exploratory process of feature engineering, particularly in research domains that have not been extensively studied with machine learning, can be time-consuming. Hence, reducing the effort involved in selecting descriptors of polymer properties and biomacromolecular interactions provides an important foundation for the generation of quick and unbiased research insights with machine learning. Increased dissemination of polymeric biomaterial feature engineering knowledge will serve to reduce time spent on the feature engineering project phase, and contribute to the shared goal of accelerating the path from materials discovery to biomaterial clinical translation and commercialization

.
Towards this aim, in this perspective, we provide overviews, as well as discussion of the advantages and limitations, of different classes of macromolecular data representations applicable to polymeric biomaterial machine learning frameworks. Many polymeric biomaterial machine learning research efforts focus on interaction prediction tasks, such as modeling how polymers will interact with a target protein, or a biological environment containing other macromolecules. Modeling interaction outcomes ultimately informs the selection of polymers for use in medical devices, which by design induce such biological interactions. Additionally, biomaterials are often composites of multiple material types (polymers, proteins, nucleic acids, peptides, etc.). While it is convenient to express proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids using their primary sequence, this is not true for polymeric materials, hence representing such a composite is a fundamental challenge to biomaterials development
22
.
With this in mind, we have focussed these discussions on the four most popular classes of macromolecular representation applicable to such polymer and biomaterials research: domain-specific descriptors, molecular fingerprints, string descriptors, and graph descriptors, described at a high level in Table
1
.

Throughout this review, we highlight examples of research applying polymer data representations that can contribute to achieving predictive biomaterial design; such that polymers and biopolymers can be proactively selected for use in a biomaterial to achieve targeted biological outcomes. We hope that this perspective will benefit researchers seeking greater technical context on feature engineering for predictive polymer biomaterial design, as well as researchers in computer science seeking greater domain context on the challenges researchers face when building predictive models of large polymer systems for biomaterials engineering.
Domain-specific macromolecular descriptors
Research focused on training supervised learning models and interpreting their learned understandings through feature importance have clarified complex biological interaction mechanisms, and inspired research directions in the macromolecular biosciences
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
,

and apply problem-specific modeling features designed by researchers intimately familiar with the physics of the domain. Altogether, supervised learning followed by feature importance analysis of problem-specific macromolecular descriptors is an excellent use case for machine learning, where there are high-quality datasets describing multivariate problem spaces
25
,
31
. There are a growing number of examples of these works to draw inspiration from across research domains that employ macromolecular biomaterials. In particular, employing analytical characterization methods in conjunction with supervised learning has proved imperative for success in deconvoluting complex behaviors.
Analytical descriptors derived from mass spectroscopy are one powerful example in this regard. Proteomic descriptors from mass spectroscopy, when combined with supervised learning, have extracted wide-ranging biomechanistic insights, including the detection of Alzheimer’s disease from nanoparticle protein coronas
32
,
33
,
34
. In one such example from nanomedicine, supervised learning and mass spectrometry were combined to accurately predict the biodistribution of nanomaterials in vivo using protein quantities present in the protein corona of PEGylated gold nanoparticles
23
. The analytical descriptors used as inputs for the neural network in this analysis were the label-free quantitative intensities from mass spectroscopy of proteins isolated from the surface of 8, 15, 35, 50, and 80 nm gold nanoparticles, over the course of 24 h of circulation in rats (
t
= 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h). Outputs were the resulting half-life, spleen gold accumulation, and liver gold accumulation of the nanoparticles as measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The workflow mapping the descriptors and outputs in this work is illustrated in Fig.
2
. Other analytically derived nanoparticle design attributes can also be applied as descriptors, such as size, zeta potential, molecular weight, and associated experimental conditions such as cell type, exposure time, exposure route, and concentration
6
. Direct descriptors of the elemental composition of self-assembling monolayers (SAMs) have also been successful for interaction prediction tasks on these macromolecular assemblies, specifically %C, %H, %O, %N, total number of atoms, and number of O-H, C-C, C-O, C-N, and C=O bonds in the SAM

Multiple modes of analytical descriptors may also be required to accurately model a biomacromolecular system. For example, augmenting experimentally derived data with high throughput physics-based simulation data can be considered, particularly in domains where molecular docking and molecular dynamics are applicable. These physics-based modeling techniques are helpful for establishing physical constraints for inverse design problems, even in cases for biological systems or complex materials design (such as in biomaterials design) where the physical models describing these processes are not well defined
35
. Moreover, these simulations can help to combat data sparsity, especially for physical parameters that would be difficult to determine experimentally, while providing an end-to-end quantification of overall model uncertainty
35
. Some examples of parameters of interest include the expected free energy of binding in protein-ligand interaction screening
36
; the diffusivity, probability of sequestration or vascular adhesion of nanocarriers for cancer drug delivery
37
; and dipole moment, polarizability, and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor ability for polymer solubility prediction tasks
38
,
39
. A final consideration for physics-based models for biopolymer prediction tasks is the length scale that the model should operate. For example, quantum chemical calculations to model electronic properties are accurate for small molecules, but often neglect considerations for polymeric materials such as conformation or morphology
40
. Coarse-grained modeling presents as an appropriate trade-off for polymer and biopolymer systems, where the goal is to represent higher-resolution systems with fewer degrees of freedom, which enables simulations at length and time scales more representative of biopolymer systems
41
. For example, coarse-grained simulations of biopolymeric galactomannans were able to accurately model the static structure, solution viscosity, and radius of gyration of guar gum gels
42
.
In terms of other domain-specific feature generators, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry can also be purposefully applied to generate analytical macromolecular descriptors of complex biomaterial interactions
43
,
44
,
45
which are well suited for supervised machine learning
36
,
46
. One such study focused on both polymer discovery and increasing mechanistic understanding of polymers for optimal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery
11
. The authors experimentally screened a library of 43 copolymers to map nine polymer descriptors to their association with toxicity and gene editing efficiency, including: polyplex radius, polymer % cationic monomer (determined by NMR), molecular weight, pK
a
, polymer hydrophobicity, RNP binding affinity, Hill coefficient, N/P ratio (i.e., nitrogen to phosphate group ratio), and charge density
11
. The trained random forest classifier identified polymer design attributes important for gene editing efficiency that the authors found counterintuitive, in particular flagging hydrophobically driven cooperative deprotonation as a promising mechanism for delivery
11
. Taken together, methodologies that parallelize polymer synthesis, high throughput screening, and multi-variate modeling are expected to continue driving results in biomaterial interaction prediction tasks
1
,

,
16
,
47
.
Finally, designed analytical descriptors have also shown promise in inverse design tasks. A supervised learning model was accurately trained using a 117-sample dataset to predict the cloud point of poly(2-oxazoline), a polymer with emerging applications in biomaterials
48
,
49
, using gradient-boosted decision trees and custom descriptors comprising varying ratios of four select monomer units, and molecular weight
30
. Molecular weight and composition ratio were identified as descriptors using domain knowledge in data curation. Interestingly, despite training from a relatively small dataset, the model in this work successfully executed polymer inverse design by synthesizing 17 de novo polymers with targeted cloud points between 37 and 80 °C with errors consistent with experimental ranges
30
. Inverse design tasks are often conducted using string descriptors, however, this among other similar works suggests that the targeted selection of physical property macromolecular descriptors can allow for the inverse design of macromolecule systems within narrow, well-defined, chemical spaces learned by supervised models

.
Despite the success of experimentally derived biomacromolecular descriptors for supervised learning, there are some challenges with this form of data representation. For one, any syntax or semantics underlying the behavior of biomacromolecules is not preserved as an integral part of the descriptors. Alternative approaches directed towards including higher-order semantic molecular information for biomacromolecules are described further on in the language-based, and graph representation section.
Reducing the initial feature set into the final set of independent descriptors most relevant to the modeling task is also challenging. Directly encoded domain-specific feature vectors describing polymeric biomaterials can possess important variables which are highly intercorrelated (i.e., Pearson Correlation Coefficient > 0.85). Domain knowledge must be applied in such cases to decide whether to remove one of the intercorrelated variables through a standardized procedure such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), or alternatively apply a dimensionality reduction technique such as principal component analysis (PCA) which enforces no linear intercorrelation between input variables. Several works make use of the LASSO method for feature selection to eliminate the least relevant descriptors to the prediction task
1
,
23
. However, in biomaterial polymer informatics, the subject properties of the model can be intercorrelated from fundamentally networked attributes, rendering dropping such information before modeling undesirable
54
. In these cases, one may use PCA to remove feature intercorrelations while limiting information loss at the expense of some direct interpretability of the resulting feature importance
54
. Some of this interpretability can be retained by examining the factor loadings obtained through PCA as they correlate with the contribution of a given input variable to the model
55
. These loadings can also be used as an unbiased means of deriving insights from complex data over the baseline of manual interpretation

. Ultimately, problem context best informs the choice of methodology for biomaterial polymer feature selection, as it does with feature engineering on the whole.
In fact, evidence from benchmarking featurization strategies for polymer property prediction suggests not only that problem context dictates which feature engineering strategy will be the best performing, but that the predictive performance of a model can degrade after applying other feature engineering strategies to a fixed problem context
17
. Polymer size is one such example of a modeling feature for which problem context dictates its predictive significance.
In the benchmark, two datasets were contrasted for their performance sensitivity to polymer size as a modeling feature in a regression task. In regression, the resulting mean absolute error (MAE) benchmarks the predictive performance of the trained model on the task. In one dataset, including polymer size as a feature decreased MAE by 50% for each of its three property prediction tasks, a marked improvement. The other dataset, including polymer size did not yield any statistically significant reductions in MAE, indicating no effect. Domain knowledge suggests two problem context factors could underlie the discrepancy in the importance of the polymer size feature. First, the target variables of the first dataset were each sensitive to the polymer size ranges characterized in the training data (20–600 constitutional units), while the prediction target of the second dataset was not sensitive at the resolution being modeled (mean = 7770 g/mol, std = 1100 g/mol). Second, that measurement noise obfuscated any effect that was measured in the training data of the second dataset, which was collected by a different means than the first dataset. These contextual factors demonstrate the common bottlenecks encountered in biomaterial polymer dataset curation. Specifically, it is exceedingly challenging, and often laborious, in biomaterials design tasks to identify both polymer design space ranges that correspond to interaction behaviors of interest, and characterize those ranges reproducibly at scale, with measurement error that does not obfuscate the desired signal
17
.
Formulating prediction tasks whereby challenges in data curation can be overcome remains an ongoing focus in the biomaterial polymer research domain. In addition to polymer size, there are innumerable design variables in polymer biomaterial development (physical, chemical, topological, etc.) whose curation will similarly impact the success of the featurization strategy in a given problem context. The challenges inherent to data curation in polymeric biomaterial design begets the premise of this work, that one size does not fit all in selecting a feature engineering strategy across predictive tasks. In a domain where problem context dictates the best feature engineering strategy, focusing on optimizing features to suit the variable-target mappings within a curated biopolymer dataset will trump the application of a generic strategy across problem domains that are not similarly curated, and where data points are scarce
56
.
The scarcity of datapoints due to the labor-intensiveness of manual data collection imposes another limitation in feature engineering that merits noting, “the curse of dimensionality.” That being, the phenomenon in deep learning where as a feature vector dimension increases, the greater the number of datapoints in the dataset required to train a model. In biomaterial domains where interaction phenomena are typically unmapped, one may consider including every available parameter as a feature to increase the probability of mapping data to the prediction target. However, the curse of dimensionality enforces an upper limit in feature vector dimensionality as predicated by the amount of data able to be collected for the predictive task. Alternatively, one may augment a small, experimentally curated domain descriptor dataset using information from open-access databases or other research studies. However, pooling datapoints as such imbues mixed variance levels in the dataset from different experimental conditions, which again risks obscuring the desired objective function for the task
22
. All such factors in data curation similarly obfuscate the ability to draw standalone comparisons of model architectures based on different biomaterial datasets. Specifically, variance in performance can be attributed to any one or combination of data curation, feature engineering, or model design and training workflows. As such, across datasets, a one-size “fits all” approach has not yet accommodated all varieties of domain-specific factors inherent to polymeric biomaterials design.
In sum, domain descriptors can yield extremely informative feature mappings between experimental parameters and target variables for a wide variety of prediction tasks in polymeric biomaterial interaction prediction. However, the highly laborious nature of data collection and data curation remains an obstacle to scaling domain descriptors, and underscores the importance of both combinatorial polymer chemistry
57
and of developing automated pathways for characterization in this area
58
,
59
,
60
. Whether data collection is automated or manual, however, problem context dictates the performance of domain descriptors.
Macromolecular fingerprint representations
Generally, fingerprinting strategies involve converting molecular information into a numeric vector, such as a bit string, which expresses structural information. There are many different approaches to molecular fingerprinting, the most popular approaches can be broadly divided into three categories: substructure-keys-based fingerprints, topological or path-based fingerprints, and circular fingerprints
61
. Substructure-keys-based fingerprints set the bits of the associated bit string based on the presence or absence of a given chemical structure or features based upon a predefined dictionary
61
. Some popular examples of substructure-based fingerprints include MACCS, PubChem fingerprints, and Klekota–Roth fingerprints
62
,
63
,
64
. Both topological and circular fingerprints rely on a hashing function that characteristically abstracts molecular patterns from the macromolecular system into a vector
3
. Topological fingerprints such as Daylight fingerprints hash the connectivity between atoms up to a certain number of bonds
61
, whereas circular fingerprints such as Extended-Connectivity fingerprints encode the chemical environment surrounding a given atom to a specified radius
65
. Thus, the attributes of these hashed descriptors are tailored to the system being modeled, rather than drawn from a predetermined schema. A principal challenge of adopting a hashed molecular fingerprinting-based chemical descriptor strategy is the connectivity of biopolymer subunits. Similarly, substructure-key fingerprints lack uniqueness as a function of structural arrangement. Some of this challenge may be alleviated by converting monomer unit fingerprints to those of their dimeric or oligomeric counterparts, though due to the stochastic nature of polymer species, the precise arrangement of subunits or substitutions (such as those in biopolymeric cellulose derivatives) is likely unknown
66
. One promising strategy to deal with this inherent ambiguity is to incorporate additional descriptors at various length scales (so-called hierarchical
67
or augmented scaled fingerprints
17
, depending upon the included parameters) to more accurately describe a given polymer. For example, the success of the Polymer Genome project is underpinned by hierarchical fingerprints derived from data describing polymers at three length scales (atomic, molecular, morphological)
67
. Further, hierarchical fingerprinting has also shown success in biopolymer materials discovery, specifically in identifying naturally derived biopolymer candidates with improved thermomechanical and transport properties compared to existing synthetic materials
68
.
It is additionally possible to combine a fingerprint with domain-specific descriptors, or graph descriptors, to correlate the molecular pattern vectors with relevant analytical and structural data. To this effect, experimentally-informed chemical fingerprints have been applied in tandem with macromolecular graph representations to perform polymer property prediction with graph neural networks
15
,
67
. A macromolecular fingerprinting approach should be selected with care, however, in tandem with a learning approach. A fingerprint benchmarking study compared the Morgan Fingerprint (MF), Molecular Embedding (ME), and Molecular Graph (MG) as alternative chemoinformatic descriptors under supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning schemes, with feed-forward neural networks predicting polymer density, melting temperature, and glass transition temperature
5
. Figure
3
depicts an exemplary fingerprint generation workflow, for each of the MF, ME, and MG, respectively. The study used 1442 homopolymer structures and labels available in the PolyInfo database, with two monomers of each structure modeled as training samples. While the ME had the best performance as a fingerprint, they found that the selected learning approach affected the explanatory chemical variables the model identified to map relationships between polymer attributes and properties with ME descriptors

Fingerprinting offers simplicity of computation at some expense of interpretability, as the same fingerprint can be used to describe two different systems (referred to as a “bit collision”)
5
. The allowance of bit collisions during fingerprinting prevents fingerprint representations from being applied directly for polymer inverse design. Additionally, latent spaces learned from fingerprint representations are considered “chemically incomplete” as the chemical features they encode are restricted to those contained by the dataset used during fingerprint hashing
14
,
16
. Latent space representations are typically created in deep representation learning, and apply architectures such as variational autoencoders for generative modeling tasks. In the context of biomaterials development, exploiting latent spaces holds much potential for increased performance. Latent spaces are well suited for global optimization as they are both continuous and differentiable
69
,
70
whereas complex chemical spaces tend to be challenging to optimize
71
. Some examples of latent space representations in polymeric materials include formulating novel biomaterial nanoaggregates of π-conjugated peptides
71
and developing polymers for extreme conditions
72
.
As a whole, particularly in exploratory macromolecular informatics where inverse design is not a focus and chemical structure can be directly encoded, the simplicity and flexibility of fingerprinting can overcome trade-offs induced by bit collisions in view of ease of computation.
String representations
Models based upon string representations encode molecular structures and properties into strings in accordance with a predefined chemical knowledge framework. These strings are then treated as character sequences for featurization, akin to learning tasks in natural language processing. Hence, models that leverage string representations are popular for their facile interpretability, memory efficiency, and ready compatibility with natural language processing algorithms
3
,
7
,
38
,
73
. They are also generally considered chemically complete, which overcomes a limitation of macromolecular fingerprinting approaches, and are explicit in their description of polymer structures
14
. Generally, the task of implementing descriptor frameworks in language-based models involves first selecting a language-based encoding for chemical data, converting these encodings to distinct sub-units known as tokens, followed by the generation of characteristic embeddings using transformer architectures. The characteristic embeddings can then be applied as the input feature vector to the desired learning task.
A very popular encoding for string representation of polymers is the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is natively designed for small molecules. Despite the fundamental differences between macromolecular and small molecule chemistries, SMILES representations have been used successfully in macromolecular machine learning. Two recent examples leveraging Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architectures polyBERT
74
and TransPolymer
75
were both able to accurately perform polymer property prediction tasks by applying these language-based approaches with polymer SMILES strings as an input. Of note the connectivity problems as discussed earlier were resolved either by explicitly denoting connectivity in the associated SMILES string or through canonicalization. Other language-inspired models such as LSTM and n-gram type models have also been applied to biomacromolecular problem spaces such as the prediction of aggregate behaviors of polymers and biopolymers and predicting the radius of gyration
56
,
76
. Generally, the choice of architecture is imperative for the success of a given model based on string descriptors. While BERTs have shown tremendous success, including outperforming other more traditional models (such as LSTMs) in polymer property prediction tasks
75
it is highly dependent on the system and modeling task.
Two more recently developed chemical string encoding frameworks are SELFIES and BIGSMILES. The SELFIES framework was developed primarily to overcome the limitations of SMILES for inverse design: every SELFIES representation corresponds to a chemically valid structure, which is not true of SMILES
52
,
53
. Both SELFIES and SMILES however are dedicated small molecule encodings and cannot uniquely encode polymer chemistry
7
. In light of this, the BIGSMILES framework was created for large polymer encodings. BIGSMILES can encode co-polymer information (homopolymer, random-, block co-polymer status), and distinguish linear, ring, and branched polymers
13
.
Outside of preexisting string formats, physical analogs in biopolymer research can be represented as domain-specific string formats and leveraged as inputs to natural language processing workflows
3
. For example, prediction of the immunogenicity of glycans, a non-linear biological macromolecule, was achieved from deep learning models trained on 19,299 glycan examples, characteristically binned into “glycoword” monosaccharide groups
77
.
It merits noting that string representations can also be applied to model biomacromolecules without the use of natural language models, similar to a fingerprint. For example, polymer functional groups encoded as SMILES can be converted to.mol files using the RDKit package to generate signature descriptors for directly training a machine learning model
1
. Using this methodology, one recent work identified monomer groups associated with macrophage-instructive behavior in meth(acrylate) and meth(acrylamide) polymers, specifically using supervised learning with multi-modal descriptors from high throughout co-polymer screening, optical microscopy, and SMILES representation
1
.
With chemical string and natural language-derived descriptors, limitations are largely related to scaling strings from atomic to macromolecular scales. In the case of SMILES, as an explicit small-molecule representation, strings become too long to feasibly parse at polymer scale and do not account for the hierarchical and stochastic nature of polymer behavior
13
. However, more efficient abstractions of large molecule systems using BIGSMILES suffer from the opposite problem: the explicit organization of the sub-components within a polymer is lost in order to incorporate stochasticity in representation
14
. Finally, approaches that apply methodology from natural language processing face the same constraints that impact natural language research only in chemical context: extensive pretraining, data augmentation, and large dataset sizes are required for these approaches to succeed in macromolecular informatics, which can handicap progress where data is scarce in this field
7
,
78
. In these cases macromolecular fingerprints and graph representations, where the direct encoding of a chemical structure is feasible to avoid such pitfalls, are reported to outperform language models when provided the same amount of data
78
. Taken together, the suitability of applying chemical string and natural language-inspired descriptors in a macromolecular informatics project, over a simpler fingerprint or domain-specific descriptor, depends on several key factors. While these factors are contextually dependent upon the objectives of the work, they broadly include data availability, the acceptable macromolecule size resolution for representation and associated chemical space trade-offs, and limitations of the available computational resources.
In terms of labor-intensiveness, generating the initial string descriptors derived from a predefined knowledge frameworks such as SMILES is relatively straight-forward as it only requires knowledge of polymer structure. Pursuing a natural language processing workflow however requires additional familiarity with complex NLP domain concepts such as tokenization and transformer models, increasing the labor and computational background required. Alternatively, fingerprinting the SMILES representation with RDKit can more readily generate feature vectors from the string representation without requiring natural language processing background. Both such approaches are readily scaled computationally using only a priori structural knowledge, which in turn makes them less laborious than manual data collection or creating a de novo biomaterial domain-specific string representation.
Graph representations of macromolecules
In computer science, graphs are data structures constructed from a collection of nodes, typically depicted as circles, and the edges, depicted as lines, which indicate relationships between nodes. The Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to deep learning became popularized as a tailwind of the deep learning renaissance brought on by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
79
. CNNs learn multi-scale feature representations from Euclidean domains of data, and can be generalized on graphs through graph convolution operations. The ability to construct supervised mappings from non-Euclidean, graph-structured data through graph convolution represented a fundamental breakthrough in chemoinformatics and supervised learning. Accordingly, numerous structure-property prediction studies resulted from small molecule graphs, as well as studies of protein interface prediction
80
,
81
,
82
. There is significant overlap between the research aims in graph learning, and predictive design for macromolecules, given the abundance of networks in macromolecular bioinformatics
83
. The formidable breakthrough in protein folding prediction by the AlphaFold deep learning model trained using graph data representations is one exemplary success of what is possible at the intersection of these rapidly evolving fields
83
,
84
.
The engine underlying success in graph structure-prediction tasks is known as representation learning. Specifically, representation learning refers to a workflow where training data is input to a GNN formatted as a graph, after which a GNN during training constructs its own vectorized encoding of the data by traversal of the input graphs
3
. The resulting vector (i.e., the “learned representation”) can be applied similarly to a hashed fingerprint, as an input feature descriptor to a downstream task-specific predictive model such as a random forest, artificial neural network, etc
3
. Hence, the primary advantage of graph representation learning in macromolecular informatics is the compatibility afforded by the graph data structure (i.e., nodes and edges) with the physical organization of macromolecular materials as monomers with linkages and resulting topology. Representation-learned encodings, in addition to the basic attributes of a macromolecule found in a fingerprint, encode the specific syntax of the interconnections within the macromolecule being modeled
15
. As well, graph representation learning is not as sensitive to the size of the training set compared to natural language processing-based models, which improves the applicability of these methods for data-constrained research
78
. However, for researchers in macromolecular biomaterials design, selecting the precise nodes and edges to define for a GNN representation learning task, and the level of systemic abstraction they represent requires careful consideration in the context of the training dataset. Newly developed frameworks for modeling polymers as macromolecules for informatics can offer inspiration in this regard.
A chemistry-informed graph representation for macromolecules was recently developed, allowing for the quantification of structural similarity of 19,147 glycan biopolymers, in terms of both chemical and topological attributes, along with interpretable macromolecular supervised learning
15
. The representation applied for this is depicted in Fig.
4
. Another recent work drew inspiration from polymer stochasticity to construct a graph representation framework for over 40,000 polymers as molecular ensembles, while incorporating chain architecture, monomer stoichiometry, and degree of polymerization in the descriptor set
78
. Additionally, a new framework has been released for end-to-end polymer informatics, PolyGrammar, which is the first to be chemically complete, molecularly explicit, physically valid, explainable, and invertible for generative polymer inverse design
14
. PolyGrammar is derived from a symbolic hypergraph representation and as proof of concept constructed representations for 600 polyurethane samples

Broadly, advances in graph representation learning for macromolecular systems present clear opportunities for paradigm shifts in predictive model capabilities, as was observed with AlphaFold
84
. However, in macromolecular domains where there are challenges with data collection, data availability, or lacking standardization where training data is available, all present obstacles to the deployment of a universal framework for molecular representation at scale
7
.
One approach to this would be using molecular descriptors to describe the sub-units of the polymeric biomaterial, and building a graph embedding from the set of sub-units. So long as the chemical space inherent in the sub-units is countable, the approach would scale. The challenge with this is defining scope to abstract a polymeric biomaterial into sub-units. Procedures for creating sub-unit definitions, for example coarse-grained polymer representations in physics-based simulations, are not always rigorously defined
56
,
85
, and their selection will introduce a level of ambiguity in the predictive task. Along these lines, the application of this descriptor class can require some customization, which increases the labor intensiveness as compared to an off-the-shelf approach.
Future research at the intersection of graph representation learning and self-driving labs for the accelerated discovery of biomacromolecular materials will present a powerful opportunity to combine both standardized data availability and the best available macromolecular data representations, in real-time
86
.
Outlook
There are many options to consider in selecting biomacromolecular machine learning descriptors for polymer interaction prediction tasks. As emphasized in this perspective, the objectives of the research project, access to data, labor-intensiveness of data collection, and downstream requirements for interpretability should be considered in balance at the outset of selecting or designing choice descriptors. The performance of a polymer interaction prediction model can be attributed to any one or combination of factors in data curation, feature engineering, or model design and training workflows. It is extremely challenging to identify polymer design space ranges that correspond to interaction behaviors of interest, and characterize those ranges reproducibly at scale, with measurement error that does not obfuscate the desired signal. Knowing this, a “one-size fits all” approach to feature selection and modeling across interaction prediction tasks for polymeric biomaterials is unlikely to accommodate all varieties of relevant domain-specific factors. The heterogeneous nature of data curation in the field underpins the wide variety of feature engineering methodologies discussed in this perspective: domain-specific, fingerprint, string, and graph descriptors.
In navigating biopolymeric feature selection, where exploratory proof of concept work is the focus, employing descriptors that are both simple and interpretable establishes trust in the data and builds scientific intuition. Alternatively, in scaling a model for deployment with an active learning system or accelerated materials discovery platform, descriptors that support model generalization and capacity for inverse design can be imperative. In either case, the process of feature engineering for a predictive task is often iterative, and ultimately reflective of the inherent predictive power of the independent variables being used to describe the target. Along these lines, there has been a shift at the forefront of machine learning research from “model-centric AI” to “data-centric AI,” which reflects the growing recognition across AI-accelerated research domains that efforts to improve the quality of training data can be more productive than efforts focused on model optimization for specific tasks
87
. In terms of data-centricity, it is hard to beat incremental value brought forward by applying high-resolution analytical tools such as mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance to enrich descriptor quality, and thus model quality. In opposition, it is very time-consuming to apply traditional analytical approaches for data generation at scale, which motivates the development of automated, scalable, data collection approaches. While one size does not fit all today, continued research efforts to automate high-resolution biomacromolecular data collection, and accurately encode biomacromolecular interaction phenomena as features, are expected to enable the next generation of predictive biomaterial polymer designs.

Abstract
Phase-field method (PFM) has become a mainstream computational method for predicting the evolution of nano and mesoscopic microstructures and properties during materials processes. The paper briefly reviews latest progresses in applying PFM to understanding the thermodynamic driving forces and mechanisms underlying microstructure evolution in metallic materials and related processes, including casting, aging, deformation, additive manufacturing, and defects, etc. Focus on designing alloys by integrating PFM with constitutive relations and machine learning. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the potential of integrated PFM in discovering new multi-scale phenomena and high-performance alloys. The article ends with prospects for promising research directions.

Introduction
Understanding the relationship among “composition-processing-microstructure-properties” is the central theme of materials science and engineering
1
. Historically, the design of new materials has predominantly relied on the “trial-error” method to adjust and analyze alloy composition and process parameters, which requires a long cycle and high costs
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
. Multiscale modeling and computing methods, briding atomic scale structures to macro properties, are playing an increasing role in understanding and interpreting experimental observations and reducing experimental costs.
Mean field approaches are popular for approximating large complex stochastic models that contain large number of interacting bodies. By averaging the multi-body interaction into single-body interaction, the mean-field approximation theory (MFT) has become basis of some computational models, such as Weiss molecular field theory (WMF), Bragg-Williams Mean field theory (BW-MFT), Landau theory, density functional theory (DFT) and phase-field methods (PFM), etc. In addition to mean field approaches, there are many other microstructure simulation models, such as Molecular dynamics method (MD), Cellular Automata method (CA), Monte Carlo method (MC), Level Set Method (LSM), Front Tracking Method (FTM), Envelope Method (EM), Mean radius approach (MRA), and Kampmann-Wagner numerical method (KWN), etc. Commonly used microstructure simulation approaches and some cases are presented in Fig.
1
. PFM is derived based on MFT and can uniquely provide critical links at both nanoscale and mesoscale, including morphology, size, spatial arrangement, transition path, defects, stress and strain distribution of various phases under complex internal or/and external effects.

The term “phase-field (PF)” was originally proposed to model mesoscale solidified dendrites
6
, with phase
∅
and concentration
C
as non-conserved and conserved field variables respectively, which is the prototype of the continuous phase-field model (CPFM). In 1991, Chen adopted the atom occupation probability
P
as the conserved field variable to establish a microscopic diffuse phase-field model (MPFM) for phase separation of binary alloys, including atomic clustering and order-disorder transformation
7
. In 2002, Elder used the average atom density
ρ
as a conserved field variable to develop the phase-field-crystal (PFC) model for wider applications, even graphene materials
8
. PFM does not need to presuppose initial microstructure configuration and track the phase or grain boundary, allowing multiple fields to be easily added together, i.e., chemical, thermal, mechanical, magnetic, electrical, and other fields, to facilitate the opening or closing the effect of one or more internal or external fields to describe the microstructure and performance evolution in materials process. Therefore, the versatility and flexibility of PFM make it applicable to a wide range of phase transformation phenomena in metallic materials, such as dendrite

, peritectic
11
, precipitation
12
, spinodal decomposition

, martensite

, and vacancy (irradiation)
21
, dislocation
22
,
23
, crack
24
, etc.
Parallel to the increase in computer power, advances in computational modeling methods have resulted in a level of sophistication which is comparable to that of experiments. PFM can be integrated or coupled with many advanced atomic scale experimental observations and various computing and intelligent approaches to help design materials and processes more accurately and widely. Figure

shows the applicable temporal and spatial scope of the above three PFMs and some applications of integrated PFMs in metallic materials. As this paper aims to summarize the application of integrated PFMs, we will not distinguish the three PFMs in the following.

Some commercial or open-source PF software packages (see Supplementary Note
I
) have been developed, which greatly promote the wide application of PFM.
Early PFM focused on modeling via setting some phenomenological parameters, gradually developed into quantitatively simulating the materials process matching the spatial and temporal scales of the experiment, which can be achieved by enlarging the interface width

,
30
,
31
,
32
, and distinguishing the crystallographic characteristics of different phases
33
,
34
,
35
. Later, researchers paid more attention to helping interpret and understand experimental microstructure by PF simulation. However, it is still an arduous task to optimize the alloy properties and design new materials.
In this brief review, we focus on the potential of integrated PFM in designing high-performance alloys fabricated in process of solidification, precipitation, deformation, or additive manufacturing, etc. In the second section, some recent applications combined with experiments to simulate microstructure evolution are introduced, showing the potential of PFM in quantitatively predicting the relationship between processing and microstructure. In the third part, several key factors, and internal mechanisms to improve alloy properties, especially the PFM design idea, are discussed. The fourth section gives some integrating or coupling ways commonly used in PFM to correlate microstructure and performance, as well as corresponding applications, also several accelerating solutions, such as machine learning and advanced algorithms. The fifth section is the concluding remark and perspective. Finally, the basic theoretical framework of PFM and the coupling path with internal or external fields are briefly summarized.

observed topological phase inversion in Ni-based superalloys after long-term aging at 1100 °C for 250h, their corresponding PF simulation indicated that the topological inversion was due to lattice misfit caused by the formation, coalescence and ripening of
\(\gamma {\prime} \)
precipitates. Besides verifying the morphology and analyzing inherent reason, another case tried to give further pattern criterion. Recently, three typical BCC/B2 coherent microstructures of Al-Ni-Co-Fe-Cr high-entropy alloys (HEAs) were obtained through experiments and PF simulations (Fig.
3
)
54
, namely spherical, cubic and woven nanoprecipitates, and the elastic mismatch criterion
\(\varepsilon > 0.4 \% \)
for cubic precipitate was proposed through PF simulation.

Morphological control can also help formulate technical parameters. Short circuit caused by dendrite growth is a key issue limiting the capacity and longevity of rechargeable battery
55
,
56
. In 2022, Lin et al.
57
introduced diffusion kinetics, interfacial anisotropy, electric field, stress field and lattice mismatch between deposit and substrate into PFM, so as to reveal the solidification mechanism of three dendrite patterns (needle-like, tooth-like, or tree-like) observed in experiment, as illustrated in Fig.
4
. Accordingly, the technology parameters of molten salt electroplating to adjust the dendrite pattern were designed to minimize the failure caused by dendrite growth.

Researchers are no longer satisfied with the cross validation of PF simulation of microstructure morphology and experimental observation, gradually turn attention to seeking the application of PFM in the melting, solidification, aging, rolling and other stages that parts may experience, thus obtaining some relationships between microstructure characteristics and material processing parameters to meet the actual needs of designing high-performance alloys, as described below.
Key process factors for optimizing performance
Dendrite arm spacing in solidification
The arm spacing between primary and/or secondary dendrites in as-cast alloys indicates the solute inhomogeneity and segregation in microstructure, which plays a crucial role in mechanical properties of castings
53
,
58
. Such process parameters as solidification speed, cooling rate, temperature gradient and local solidification time are closely related to the dendrite arm spacing
59
. Bellón et al. quantitatively predicted the stable range of primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) in Al-1 wt.%Cu and Al-4 wt.%Cu alloys
60
using PFM and dendritic needle network method as shown in Fig.
5
, and proposed the process parameters to reduce the PDAS and refine the grains, thereby mitigating shrinkage, porosity, cracks and other casting defects.

The above casting defects can be accurately predicted by the macro casting simulation software (EasyCast, ProCast, Novacast, Magma, etc.). Hence, an imperative necessary is to combine meso PF simulation with macro casting software to realize the integrated design from microstructure to defect prediction, and finally to high-performance alloys and structural or functional components.
Early clustering in aging
Generally, as-cast alloys need to undergo heat treatment processes such as homogenization, aging, annealing, quenching, and normalizing, etc. to improve microstructure and properties. Small coherent clustering or Guinier-Preston (GP) zone, precipitated at the earliest quenching or aging stage, is also critical to the mechanical properties of alloys
61
. Both PFC method and MPFM can capture the phase transition details of diffusion time on the atomic scale, which can shed significant light on the elusive fast transformation of the formation, growth and enrichment of early clustering
33
. For instance, Fallah group
33
,
34
,
35
,
62
elucidated the complete free energy path of early clustering in supersaturated Al-Cu, Al-Cu-Mg, and Al-Mg-Si alloys with PFC, found that dislocations (Fig.
6
) can significantly reduce the energy barrier height and the critical nucleation size, resulting in higher aggregation rate and finer clusterings

Additionally, the following specific phase separation mechanism leading to microstructure diversity containing various defects, always plays a significant role in affecting materials performance.
Spinodal decomposition (SD) in precipitation
Compared with the nucleation and growth mechanism (NG), the most prominent difference of SD is that no nucleation energy barrier is required
63
. Xin et al.
64
designed an SD strengthened ultralight high-strength Mg-14Li-7Al (LA147, wt.%) alloy by using experiments and PF simulation, and its specific yield strength (470-500 kNmkg
−1
) almost exceeds that of all other engineering alloys. As shown in Fig.
7
, PF simulation not only provides direct evidence of D0
3
-Mg
3
Al ordered phase precipitated by SD, but also quantitively determines the amplitude modulation wavelength of three stages in SD, i.e., incubation period, rapid growth period, and equilibrium period. Subsequently, they further explored the precipitation mechanism and sequence in Mg-11Li-3Al alloy
65
, in which the PF simulation reproduced the evolution mechanism from
\(\theta \)

-Mg

Al) phase to Al-Li phase with core-shell structure after medium temperature (270 °C) aging, and predicted the corresponding hardness.

The microstructures generated by SD or NG mechanisms usually work under different temperatures, stress, or other load conditions, which may form various point defects, line defects and surface defects, and have a serious impact on alloy properties. Currently, PF simulation plays an increasingly important role in alloy design considering defect formation and evolution.
Defects of twins and dislocations during deformation
Nanotwins can improve the work hardening rate of metallic materials
66
,
67
, which is mainly due to the interplay between dislocations and twins, including de-twinning
68
,
69
, dislocation crossing twin boundary
70
and twin boundary steps becoming dislocation accumulation site or dislocation sources
71
,
72
, etc. PFC
73
is an effective tool for intuitively revealing the interaction between nanotwins and dislocations during equal volume deformation of rolling, forging, or Split-Hopkinson-Pressure-Bar. Here, strain rate
\(\dot{\varepsilon } < {10}^{-7} \sim {10}^{-2}\,{s}^{-1}\)
is applied to avoid calculation divergence.
For example, a new Cu
92
Al
5
Ni
3
(wt.%) alloy
74
with tensile strength of 797.06 Mpa and elongation of 28.66% was designed through melting-aging-deformation processes. PF simulation showed that the interplay between twins and dislocations led to such high performance, as shown in Fig.
8
, including twin boundary fragmentation, formation/annihilation of dislocation dipoles, and climbing-slipping motion of dislocations. The typical characteristics of high strength-ductility Cu alloys, such as fine grains, high twin density and stable grain boundaries, were also proposed.

Defects of Void and bubble expansion
PFM is also used to predict the evolution of bubbles and voids during irradiation, to calculate local thermodynamic properties, and to evaluate the microstructure effect on the properties of metallic materials
75
. For example, Hu et al.
76
put forward the concept of effective thermal conductivity
\({K}_{G}\)
, employed the heat transport equation and PFM of polycrystalline U–Mo fuel alloy with a given crystal morphology and gas bubble distribution to calculate the thermal conductivity of heterogeneous systems, Fig.

Diffusionless martensitic transformation
The diffusionless martensite transformation is often accompanied by high strength and hardness, e.g., the tensile strength of martensitic steel is within 600 MPa~1600 MPa. Shchyglo et al.
77
found that when the carbon content increased from 0.1% to 0.3%, the yield strength of lath martensitic low-carbon steel increased by 45.83%, which can be attributed to displacive martensitic transformation. However, due to the extremely rapid formation of martensite, it is almost impossible to experimentally capture the nucleation and growth of martensite in steel. Therefore, they proposed a martensite PFM considering 24 K-S variants to reveal the process from nucleation to final complex microstructure (as shown in Fig.
10
), and clarified the martensite strengthen mechanism.

Additionally, martensite transformation of Ni-Ti-based shape memory alloys
78
,
79
and the tetragonal to monoclinic transition of Zr alloys
80
,
81
are also investigated by PFM.
Integrating and correlating performance models
The aforementioned PFM design scheme is effective by comparing the morphology and associating the actual process parameters. How to directly, accurately, and efficiently design high-practical service performance alloys using PFM is a more urgent issue. Here we concisely summarize several integrating and correlating ways and prominent applications: (I) empirical models, (II) machine learning, (III) advanced algorithms, (IV) coupling with discrete models of continuum system, (V) integrating with macroscopic constitutive equations, and(VI) optimizing process parameters.
Empirical models correlating with performance
Introducing microstructure data from extensive experiments or PF simulations as variables into empirical models can characterize the microstructure evolution, and obtain mechanical response, thus improving the efficiency of screening high-performance materials.
Geometric hardening parameter
The critical stress
\({\sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}\)
of crack initiation in mushy zone of Fe-C alloy is related to the geometric hardening parameter
\(\eta \)
caused by the interdendritic contact area
82
,
$${\sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}=\eta \cdot [{}^{\delta }{f}_{{\rm{s}}}{\sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}^{\delta }{+}^{\gamma }{f}_{{\rm{s}}}{\sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}^{\gamma }]$$
(1)
where
\({\sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}^{\delta }\)
and
\({\sigma }_{{\rm{c}}}^{\gamma }\)
are the flow stress of
\(\delta \)
-phase (Fe-0.11wt.%C) and
\(\gamma \)
-phase (Fe-0.60 wt.%C).
\({}^{\delta }{f}_{{\rm{s}}}\)
and
\({}^{\gamma }{f}_{{\rm{s}}}\)
are the solid fraction of
\(\delta \)
-phase and
\(\gamma \)
-phase. From Lee and Kim’s yield criterion for porous metals
83
, the geometric hardening parameter
\(\eta \)
is proposed as the function of solid fraction
84
,
$$\eta =\frac{L}{\lambda }={[\frac{{f}_{s}-{}^{c}f_{s}}{1-{}^{c}f_{s}}]}^{a}\,{\rm{at}}\,0 \,< \,{}^{c}f_{s}\le {f}_{s}\le 1$$

\(L/\lambda \)
) in Fig.

is more consistent with measured data in Fig.

Comprehensive evaluation function
Based on the microstructure information obtained from 10 sets of 3D PF simulations and 40 sets of experiments, taking the phase-fraction, grain-size, and shape- factor of
\(\gamma {\prime} \)
precipitate as evaluation indicators, Ta et al.
85
proposed an evaluation function (3) to select the best composition and heat treatment schedule, and found Ni-19.36 at.% alloy had the best mechanical properties aging at 973 K for 100000 s. The following linear comprehensive evaluation function is established by empowering weight
\({w}_{1}\)
,
\({w}_{2}\)
and
\({w}_{3}\)
to different indicators
85
,
$${\rm{Composite}}\,{\rm{indicator}}={w}_{1}\times {\rm{Phase}}\_{\rm{fraction}}+{w}_{2}\times {\rm{Grain}}\_{\rm{size}}+{w}_{3}\times {\rm{Shape}}\_{\rm{factor}}$$

\({w}_{2}\)
and
\({w}_{3}\)
are the weight factor of phase volume fraction, grain size, and geometric shape of
\(\gamma ^{\prime}\)
precipitates, respectively. The evaluation function represents the quality of alloy performance.
Critical resolved shear stress increment
For shear-resistant precipitates, dislocations are difficult to cut through, and often bypass the precipitates by Orowan mechanism, leaving dislocation loops around the precipitates to block dislocation motion
86
. The precipitation behavior of Mg-Re alloy during non-isothermal aging was studied by PFM, the critical resolved shear stress (
\({\rm{CRSS}}\)
) increment caused by Orowan loop for spherical and plate-shaped precipitates was given by ∆
τ
s
87
and Δ
τ
p
88
, respectively,
$$\varDelta {\tau }_{s}=\frac{\mu \cdot G{\bf{b}}}{2\pi M\cdot {\lambda }_{r}}\,\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{R}{{r}_{0}}\right)$$
(4)
$$\Delta {\tau }_{p}=\frac{G{\bf{b}}}{2\pi \sqrt{1-\nu }(0.825\sqrt{\frac{{d}_{t}{t}_{t}}{f}}-0.393{d}_{t}-0.866{t}_{t})}\times \,\mathrm{ln}\,\frac{0.866\sqrt{{d}_{t}{t}_{t}}}{{\bf{b}}}$$

Integrating with machine learning
The number of microstructural and compositional parameters, processes, and configurations to combine to invent a new material is enormous. Compared with traditional physical methods, using machine learning (ML), we can directly face the required performance, avoid interwinding in physical and chemical processes, and efficiently and quickly design new materials or optimize manufacturing process of existing materials in a cross-scale manner. The ever-increasing computational resources and development of advanced ML models such as reinforcement learning
92
, Gaussian process regression
93
, and many other numerical algorithms make ML-PF modeling a rapidly growing topic
94
,
95
,
96
,
97
. Its main strategies can be roughly summarized as follows: (1) generating datasets by PFM to construct neural networks
96
,
98
, (2) using ML technology to build a fast and reliable surrogate model of PFM
99
,
100
,
101
,
102
,
103
,
104
, (3) extracting key microstructure information from PFM to generate image datesets
105
,
106
,
107
, and (4) integrating machine-learned functions or parameters (e.g. free energies, partial differential equations, mobilities) as a model
101
,
108
,
109
for PFM. Yet, the size and uncertainty of training data, the selection of training metrics, and the balancing of accuracy, interpretability and versatility are still difficult tasks
110
.
Here, we list several promising examples of accelerating or innovating metallic systems design via PFM coupled with ML code, which is a critical knowledge gap and one of the research directions worth expanding in the future.
From microstructure to performance
Predicting material properties from their microstructure is an active research field in ML field.
In 2021, Vilalta et al.
111
used PF dislocation dynamics simulation to obtain different stacking fault energy (SFE) distributions of Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Mn family HEAs, and input them into the ML model as learning data to predict the relationship between yield stress and SFE, with an error of about 2%, as shown in Fig.
14
(b
1
-b

), showing that for a given SFE, the yield stress increases slightly in the size between 1 nm and 4 nm, and the critical yield stress has a peak between the mean SFE of 40 mJ/m~50 mJ/m.

), volume fraction of nanofillers (

Some machine learning techniques accelerating PF simulation
With the ever-increasing computing resources and development of advanced machine learning algorithms, the strategy of “machine learning-phase field method” has an extremely broad application prospect
112
. So far, this strategy mainly focuses on the identification of microstructure evolution diagrams and accelerates the solution of partial differential equations (Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations). Deep Neural Network (DNN) including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has paved the way for identification of microstructure evolution diagrams. Notably, such RNN or its subclass of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been proved to be successful in rapidly predicting the time evolution of the microstructure. On the other hand, Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), as the general neural network framework of the dynamic system governed by the free energy functional gradient flow, provide a promising method for the efficient solution of partial differential equations coupled physical field information.
RNN and LSTM
RNN can preserve past information and handle temporal dependencies, i.e., the history of microstructure evolution
113
. In this way, phase-field simulations can be redefined as multivariable time-series problem
99
,
113
,
114
. In order to overcome the shortcoming of vanishing or exploding gradients that often exist when using RNN, LSTM is proposed as a subclass of RNN, which has better accuracy and long-term predictability, also can predict next frame. Compared with the original phase-field simulation, the accelerated phase-field framework with LSTM can not only maintain the same accuracy, but also accelerate the prediction speed at least three orders of magnitude

DeepONet and FNO
In 2019, Brown University proposed a DeepONet that uses operators to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), which is unique in that it has two parts: branch and trunk. Some operators are generated by branch network learning to approximate the input data, while the trunk network is responsible for the output data. Finally, the data from the two networks are introduced into DeepONet to solve the PDEs. DeepONet is one of the possible ways to learn phase-field-free energy functional solution operators from the labeled input-output datasets in high-dimensional systems (e.g., multiple phases, scales, and physical fields). This architecture is capable of learning the mapping of field variable distribution from the current time step to the next time step
118
. According to statistics, compared with traditional high-fidelity phase-field simulation, the framework integrating a convolutional autoencoder architecture with a DeepONet would save 135 minutes for each evolution. DeepONet has been applied to research crack path in quasi-brittle materials
119
and spinodal decomposition of a two phase mixture
120
, etc.
Another simpler architecture called “Fourier neural operator (FNO)” developed by California Institute of Technology can dramatically speed up the solution of PDE by using many Fourier layers. In an example of solving Navier-Stocks (N-S) equation, 30,000 simulations are needed, FNO solution time is less than one second, and DeepONet takes 2.5 seconds, while the traditional solver takes 18 hours
121
. Then, they presented an enhanced Fourier neural operator, named U-FNO, that combines the advantages of FNO-based and CNN-based models to provide results for PDEs that are both highly accurate and data efficient
122
. Now, FNO and U-FNO have been successfully used to solve N-S equations of single-phase or multiphase flows. Therefore, it is very promising to use DeepONet or FNO/U-FNO architecture to solve the Allen-Cahn or/and Cahn-Hilliard equations of PFM.
Genetic algorithms
Genetic algorithm is a random search method, which can converge to a global minimum value of the objective function
123
. Using genetic algorithms to solve optimization problems includes problem coding, generation of initial population, fitness computation, selection, crossover, and mutation, etc. In recent computational studies, Sugathan et al.
124
introduced the effective Landau coefficients that are optimized by genetic algorithms to phase-field free energy equations for ferroelectric switching characteristics. The simulation results showed introducing a lower ferroelectric phase fraction, more crystal structure, and more columnar grain was preferable for ferroelectric applications.
Desai et al.
125
discovered novel, time-dependent protocols with time-varying deposition rate and mobility using genetic algorithm. Coupling with PFM, the targeted microstructures can be obtained, such as the lateral concentration modulation with lower deposition rate and higher deposition time, the vertical concentration modulation with high deposition rate, and hierarchical concentration modulation falling in the middle, the workflow is shown in Fig.

Advanced numerical schemes for high calculation efficiency
PFM is relatively slow to explore large composition-processing-microstructure-properties space. In addition to the above machine learning methods, the phase-field community has also been exploring a variety of novel algorithmic solutions to speed up and accelerate phase-field simulations.
Adaptive mesh refinement
Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is an effective tool for numerically solving partial differential equations in arbitrarily shaped and complex regions. By automatically changing the mesh size according to specific needs of different regions
126
, the number of meshes is reduced to save computing time. Besides, AMR is often used to extend the simulation length equivalent to actual experimental scale, without disturbing resolution on thin interfaces. For instance, the PF models of solidification and fracture are typical representatives, but with some difficulties in implementation and programming.
When AMR is used for dendrite growth during solidification, especially with thermal diffusion
127
, gas porosity
128
, melt convection
129
, the fine meshes are dynamically employed in interface region, while coarse meshes are in elsewhere. Figure

gives two examples of dendritic growth simulated by PFM with AMR. Compared with the uniform mesh, the calculation efficiency is improved by 1-2 orders of magnitude

GPU technique
The parallel GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a popular tool for large-scale and high-performance computing owing to the massive computation and high memory bandwidth
136
. Computation with GPU is about 36 times faster than that with a single Central Processing Unit (CPU) core
137
.
The heterogeneous parallel platform, composed of different architectures such as Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), Open Computing Language (OpenCL), and combined with parallel programming methods such as MPI-Message Passing Interface or OpenMP- Open Multi Processing, is an effective means for overcoming the shortcomings of large amount of calculation, small simulation scale, and usually limited to qualitative research. For example, GPU+CUDA or MPI+CUDA+GPU for calculating 3D dendritic growth

lists two examples using a heterogeneous parallel platform. MPI +OpenMP hybrid parallel programming is faster than that using only MPI parallel method to simulate dendrite growth, as shown in Fig.
20a, b
. Compared with CPU serial program, the computational efficiency for simulating eutectic growth based on GPU has increased by two orders of magnitude, as shown in Fig.
20c
. However, the calculation time of small-scale simulation may be longer, because it takes extra time to create and release parallel domains and data transmission.

So, traditional accelerated algorithms (AMR, GPU, etc.), and machine learning technologies (RNN, CNN-LSTM, DeepONet, etc.) are all necessary for accelerating phase-field simulation to design high-performance alloys.
Coupling with discrete models of continuum system
Using numerical discrete models of macro or micro continuum materials, including finite element model (FEM), finite difference model (FDM), finite volume model (FVM) and fast Fourier transformation (FFT) spectral method, etc, to connect the microstructure characteristics of micro areas with mechanical properties of the same macro continuum through thermodynamic parameters, is a promising approach for “virtual machining” and “virtual design” of novel metallic materials. It should be pointed out that in some published literature, FEM is unilaterally defined as a physical modeling method applicable to macro systems, which is not appropriate, because FEM is really a numerical discrete technique for continuum media consisting of elements with no physical meaning. Only when coupled with various constitutive or physical equations can it have corresponding physical definitions. As shown in Fig.
21
, like FDM, FEM can be used to discretize and solve the phase-field equations on micro scale, that is, the micro phase-field equations can be numerically solved by FEM, FDM, FVM, LBM or FFT, etc. Hence, FEM is really a discrete method, which can be used in any continuum system on any spatial scale, including micro and macro scales.

The grain size is often used to bridge the PFM describing process-microstructure relation and the crystal plasticity (CP) FE model describing microstructure-property relation, and a process-structure-performance relationship is built
145
, as shown in Fig.

. The grain growth process and grain size distribution of IN100 alloy annealed at 650 °C obtained from PF simulation are input into the CPFE model to analyze the influence of precipitate size and volume fraction with different annealing time on mechanical properties of the alloy.

developed a CPFE model coupled phase-field (CPFE-PF) model to predict the relationship among thermo-mechanical process, microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties of ultra-low carbon steel, the flow chart is shown in Fig.

. The state variables including grain size, orientation and stored energy are transferred between the models, then the CPFE-PF model for rolling deformation of ultra-low carbon steel was verified experimentally, showing that the computing model was consistent with the experiment when appropriate number of grains were contained.

Using a similar CPFE-PF framework, a closed loop from microstructure prediction to corresponding mechanical performance evaluation of
\(\alpha +\beta \)
titanium alloys was established
147
(Fig.

). PFM was used to investigate the variant selection of α precipitate in Ti-6Al-4V alloy under specifically applied stresses, and the mechanical properties of typical microstructures under fatigue stress, normal stress, and shear stress were evaluated by using CPFE model. It was found that the micro-texture formed under shear deformation brings the alloy higher strength.

Integrating constitutive relations
In fact, in previous sections of this review, when elastic strain energy or plastic deformation energy is added to the free energy in Cahn-Hillard equation or Alen-Cahn equation, or when PFM is combined with crystal plasticity (CP) theory, PFM already has been coupled with constitutive equation of the material. So, here we just list several common constitutive equations combined with PF model, including elastic (E), elastic-plastic (EP), visco-plastic (VP), rigid-plastic (RP), visco-elastic (VE), and elastic visco-plastic (EVP) models, see Supplementary Note
II
for details.
The EP-dislocation dynamics models (DDM) include discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) for dislocation line
148
and continuous dislocation dynamics (CDD) for dislocation density. Gao et al. used DDD to discuss the relation between creep properties and microstructure, including volume fraction
149
, morphology resulting from misfit stresses
150
, and crystallographic orientation
151
of
\(\gamma ^{\prime}\)
phase, and found that the best deformation performance was due to narrow and homogeneous
\(\gamma \)
matrix channels, and small positive lattice mismatch between
\(\gamma \)
and
\(\gamma ^{\prime}\)
phase as shown in Fig.
25
. However, this model is limited to the dislocation motion in static precipitates.

154
. They found that in the initial creep stage, the primary
\({\rm{\gamma }}/{\rm{\gamma }}{\prime} \)
microstructure, i.e., smaller
\({\rm{\gamma }}/{\rm{\gamma }}{\prime} \)
misfit, larger
\(\gamma {\prime} \)
size, and higher
\(\gamma {\prime} \)
volume fraction, can result in better creep resistance
3
, as shown in Fig.
26
. Furthermore, another coupling model of PF and CDD based on plasticity and damage is also established to solve the “swallow-gap” problem in early creep stage and the “dislocation not cutting” problem at tertiary creep stage
154
, showing that the increase of dislocation and creep strain in the early and third creep stages are due to the multiplication of dislocation in
\(\gamma \)
channels and the dislocation cutting into
\(\gamma {\prime} \)
precipitates respectively.

proposed that the strength change of Fe-15Mn-10Al-0.8C-5Ni and Fe-15Mn-10Al-0.8C (wt.%) light steels is closely related to the annealing temperature and the morphology of ordered phases. As shown in Fig.
29
, the morphology of B2 intermetallics in Fe-Al and Fe-Al-Ni systems and the morphology of
\(\kappa \)
-carbides in Fe-Mn-Al-C system at different annealing temperatures (500 °C, 700 °C, 900 °C, 1050 °C) were simulated by PFM, it was found that the addition of Ni led to the ordering of
\(\alpha \)
phase and the transformation to a stringer B2 precipitate, preventing the formation of
\(\alpha +\kappa \)
lamellar structure. At 500 ° C and 700 °C, the mechanical properties of the alloy were not improved. When annealed at 900 °C and 1050 °C, B2 precipitates changed from faceted shape to disk-like shape, and due to the Ni-Al bond being much stronger than the Fe-Al bond, the alloy shows higher strength (~980 MPa) and lower plasticity (~10%).

. Their PF simulation includes two contributions. (i) Select reasonable welding process parameters. High power matching high welding speed (power should not exceed 3000 W, speed should not exceed 120 mm/s) can reduce columnar crystals and refine dendrite structure. (ii) Increasing nucleation density can significantly refine grains in heterogeneous nucleation. Adding an appropriate amount of Ti (~1.7 wt.%) to the weld can reduce the width of columnar crystal zone and secondary dendrite spacing. The tensile strength of the joint with the above two optimization methods was increased from 303 MPa to 313 MPa and 320 MPa, respectively

Conclusion remarks and prospects
The versatility and easy implementation of PFM make it play an increasingly central role in finding and designing innovative metallic materials, this short review focuses on deciphering the core ideas and some typical applications of PFM in guiding the design of high-performance alloys. Obviously, its applications are far broader than metallic materials, such as ferroelectric/ferromagnetic materials
168
,
169
, nanometer singular materials (graphene
170
, metallic glass
171
, liquid crystal
172
, and aerogel
173
), biomedical
174
, polymer
175
and so on. As a matter of fact, it has been extensively applied to predict the microstructure and performance of almost all existing material processes, including melting and solidification, casting, aging, heat treatment, solid phase transformation, forging, welding, creep, deformation, defect evolution, corrosion, irradiation, additive manufacturing, sintering, and fracture failure, etc.
The design strategy of innovative materials with outstanding performance through PF simulation can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage is to achieve cross-validation of PF simulation and experiment by comparing microstructure morphology. The second stage is to introduce the relationship between microstructure and macro performance into PFM. The third stage is to optimize the process parameters, screen out the best microstructure, and ultimately guide the design of high-performance alloy through PFM integrated with various computing and experimental and machine learning methods. At any stage, the goal of integrated PFM simulation is to design high-performance materials and optimize their manufacturing processes accurately, efficiently, energy-saving and economically.
To this end, several upgrading strategies are proposed here, but not limited to these, to achieve the perfect cohesion and implementation of the above different stages and ultimate goals.
It is necessary to establish a multi-level unified PFM, which takes the conserved or non-conserved field variables with multiple physical meanings as the multiscale order parameters, combines thermodynamic conditions, dynamic processes and free energy function modeling theory, and can fully consider various internal and external processes of multicomponent, multiphase and polycrystalline systems.
Strengthen the integration of multi-scale computing methods and experiments, that is, combine the first principles, molecular dynamics, cellular automata, crystal plasticity theory, flow fluid mechanics, machine learning, experiment, and other methods to transfer multi-directional data, which is helpful to achieve the convert and intersection of materials and process design information at different spatial and temporal scales.
It is necessary to further establish a variety of fast numerical algorithms and reliable large-scale Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel computing technologies for PF equations based on FEM, FFT, FVM, FDM, LBM, etc., and it is also urgent to combine various macro process optimization technologies or industrial software packages to accelerate the prediction, design, optimization and production of high-performance alloys and actual components.
Fundamental theory of phase-field model
The comprehensive reviews of PFM were first published in the
Annual Review of Materials Research
by Chen
176
and Karma
177
in 2002. Since then, many review articles of PFM with different emphasis
36
,
38
,
178
,
179
,

,

have emerged.
In PFM, two types of field variables that are continuous across the interface are used to describe the microstructure evolution. Conserved field variables are related to density quantities, such as local concentration, atomic occupation probability, or atom average density, etc., the governing equation is given by Cahn-Hilliard equation
182
,
$$\frac{\partial {c}_{i}({\boldsymbol{r}},t)}{\partial t}=\nabla {M}_{ij}\nabla \frac{\delta F}{\delta {c}_{j}({\boldsymbol{r}},t)},i,j=1,2,\cdots ,n$$
(7)
where
\(F\)
is the total free energy of the system,
\({c}_{1},{c}_{2},\cdots {c}_{n}({\boldsymbol{r}},t)\)
are the conserved field variable which is continuous at spatial coordinate
\({\boldsymbol{r}}\)
and time
\(t\)
,
\(\nabla \)
is Hamiltonian operator,
\({M}_{ij}\)
is the atomic mobility between components
\(i\)
and
\(j\)
,
\(\frac{\delta F}{\delta {c}_{j}({\boldsymbol{r}},t)}\)
denotes the thermodynamic driving force.
The evolution of non-conserved field variables related to structural symmetric parameters, such as long-range order parameter, elastic or plastic strain, polarization, structural variant, etc., is controlled by Allen-Cahn equation

$$\frac{\partial {\eta }_{\alpha }({\boldsymbol{r}},t)}{\partial t}=-{L}_{\alpha \beta }\frac{\partial F}{\partial {\eta }_{\beta }({\boldsymbol{r}},t)},\alpha ,\beta =1,2,\cdots ,{\rm{p}}$$
(8)
where
\({\eta }_{1},{\eta }_{2},\cdots {\eta }_{{\rm{p}}}({\boldsymbol{r}},t)\)
are non-conserved field variables,
\({L}_{\alpha \beta }\)
denotes the structural relaxation coefficient,
\({M}_{ij}\)
and are
\({L}_{\alpha \beta }\)
can be determined by thermodynamic and diffusion kinetic databases
47
.
The free energy function generally includes the following,
$$F={\int }_{\varGamma }[{f}_{{\rm{loc}}}+{f}_{{\rm{grad}}}+{f}_{{\rm{add}}}]{\rm{d}}V$$
(9)
where the local free energy density
\({f}_{{\rm{loc}}}\)
is a function of various field variables, i.e., composition
\({c}_{i}\)
, long-range ordered parameters
\({\eta }_{i}\)
, polarization
\({p}_{i}\)
, magnetization
\({m}_{i}\)
, strain
\({\varepsilon }_{ij}\)
, etc. The quantitative models for real alloys require careful identification of parameters and constitutive relations from thermodynamic databases, CALPHAD, experiments, or other computational methods.
The gradient energy term describes the energy contribution at interface or domain,
$${f}_{{\rm{grad}}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{N}\frac{{\kappa }_{i}}{2}{|\nabla {c}_{i}|}^{2}+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{j}^{M}\frac{{\kappa }_{j}}{2}{|\nabla {\eta }_{j}|}^{2}$$
(10)
where
\({\kappa }_{i}\)
and
\({\kappa }_{j}\)
are the gradient coefficient, which can affect the interface width and interface energy.
\(N\)
and
\(M\)
are the number of conserved and non-conserved field variables respectively.
\({f}_{{\rm{add}}}\)
is additional energy including elastic strain energy, plastic deformation energy, magnetic energy, or electrical energy, etc. The competition between the contributions of these different physical phenomena to the total energy quickly and efficiently outlines the colorful microstructure morphology, making up for the lack of experimental measures that are difficult to dynamically capture information from nano to mesoscopic scales.
Recently, from the perspective of various order parameters, coupling of multi-physical fields and integration with some advanced algorithms or machine learning methods, the integrated phase-field method (IPFM)
184
can be included in the framework of materials genome initiative (MGI) and integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), which is more conductive to better application of phase-field method in more engineering materials design.

MODEL, GUESS, CHECK: Wordle as a primer on active learning for materials research
Research and games both require the participant to make a series of choices. Active learning is a process borrowed from machine learning for algorithmically making choices that has become increasingly used to accelerate materials research. While this process may seem opaque to researchers outside the field of machine learning, examining active learning in games provides an accessible way to showcase the process and its virtues. Here, we examine active learning through the lens of the game Wordle to both explain the active learning process and describe the types of research questions that arise when using active learning for materials research.

Correcting the corrections for charged defects in crystals
While the theory of imperfections in solids is firmly established, procedures for first-principles calculations of defect quantities continue to evolve. A plethora of ad hoc correction schemes is being replaced by sophisticated self-consistent procedures that will enable more quantitative predictions of the formation energies of defect species and their spectroscopic signatures.

Introduction
“I really am not seeing how women are still considered disadvantaged in our field.”
This phrase is heard all-too-often by woman scientists across many fields. And while attitudes on gender equity and parity have considerably improved in recent history, there are still measurable inequities stemming from systemic bias in the career progression, recognition, and perception of women in the sciences, including our sub-field of computational materials research.
Addressing the obstacles to equity is in the interests of all of us. Making research inclusive is critical, not only from an ethical standpoint, but also for attracting and retaining dedicated and talented minds, enhancing the vibrancy of all fields, and nurturing a diverse range of ideas. Diversity in representation and thought can increase a group’s collective intelligence, improve productivity, and improve retention in growing fields such as ours
1
,
2
,
3
. Representation of the entire populace is also necessary for ensuring that science is responsible and relevant to societal needs
4
.
In this perspective, we review the current challenges and barriers for women in the sciences, citing data and analyses from the literature, and including, where appropriate, contextualized anecdotes. Many of these experiences are not singular to gender, and often intersect and compound with other aspects of one’s identity, including those related to race, sexual orientation, religion, country of origin, and disability. Yet, while it may be true that improving equity along one dimension of diversity may improve the environment for everyone, it is important to both independently and intersectionally center these other dimensions in actions and initiatives, as biases against other underrepresented populations are also nuanced and deserving of attention.
Although the intersecting set of challenges faced by women in the sciences is daunting, numerous efforts are ongoing to address them at both the individual and collective levels. We close by outlining some of these successful practices to further equity in the sciences.
How representative is the current academic landscape in computational materials research?
"During my undergraduate studies (only about a decade ago), I had one woman professor in my materials science classes and none in my computer science classes. And in these classrooms, I was one of a few women, if not the only woman, present. Because of this, my male professors often took an opportunity to single me out or ask me to relate their examples to my lived-in experience. All of this subconsciously communicated that I didn’t belong or that I had to be extraordinary to justify my presence.” (Female researcher)
We start by quantifying and contextualizing the number of women within the relevant fields of materials science and engineering (MSE), chemical engineering (ChE), physics, and chemistry, noting especially how the proportion of women drops at every rung of the career ladder (a phenomenon often referred to as the “leaky pipeline”).
Each year the US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports the number of degrees awarded by US academic institutions, separated by discipline and gender. From their reported data (covering 1992–2019)
5
, see Fig.
1
, we see some improvement in undergraduate representation over the past 30 years in the chemistry and MSE fields, in which the percentage of degrees awarded to women increased by 5–10% (with chemistry recently reaching parity). Other fields, such as chemical engineering and physics, have remained somewhat stagnant in undergraduate degree representation. Across all fields, the proportion of graduate degrees awarded to women has steadily increased over the past 30 years. While we lack similarly granular data for most other countries, corresponding trends have been noted for non-US institutions
6
,
7
,
8
, namely that despite gains in proportional representation in related graduate degrees, the gap between male and female undergraduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often still looms large. These trends project that many
graduate programs should reach parity within the next century
; however, reaching
parity within the undergraduate populations (apart from chemistry) is likely impossible in the near future
without any meaningful changes in the current rates.

.
Arrow widths are proportional to the rate of increase. Trendlines were determined through regularized linear regression.

These trends reflect the disciplines at large, not solely the computationally-focused subdivisions within each field. Alarmingly, the nearby fields of
computer science and mathematics have shown a noted
decline
in the proportion of female graduates in the past decades
9
, which suggests that the improvement in the representation of women in theory- and computation-focused physical sciences may be below what is suggested by the discipline-wide data.
According to the Academic Analytics Research Center, which compiles data on academic representation and recognition, roughly 14–20% of professors (at all ranks) in these fields are women
10
,
11
, see Fig.
2
, with the
representation dropping with professorial rank
(i.e., significantly more women are junior and mid-level professors than full professors). The proportion of women entering faculty positions in STEM has risen in recent years
12
; thus, the lack of senior women faculty could be partially explained by the retirement and turnover of historically male faculties. However, Wapman et al.
13
showed that the
higher attrition rate of (both non-white and) female faculty members
largely contributes to the lack of diversity at higher professorial ranks and noted that strong emphasis should be placed on retaining diverse colleagues in academic departments.

).
Striped bars indicate faculty of unknown gender. Here we use the American-style professorial ranks, where an “assistant” professor refers to a pre-tenure junior professor, an “associate” professor refers to a post-tenure mid-level professor, and a “full” professor refers to a senior-level tenured professor.

What causes and perpetuates disadvantages in research environments?
In order to take positive actions to address the current and historical barriers faced by women in STEM environments, it is first necessary to understand the underlying causes and effects of these barriers. We hope this will not only help to raise awareness in the community, but will also serve as a concise summary and starting point for researchers committed to making a difference in transforming the research landscape. We summarize the sociological phenomena that lead to gender-based inequities, many of which can be addressed by thorough and regular unconscious bias training. These inequities can be primary and/or secondary in nature,
i.e
., disadvantages caused by both underlying stereotypes of women and by the response of society, institutions, and persons to these stereotypes. These are also summarized in Fig.
3
.

Many of these phenomena are interrelated, and it is important to take a multi-pronged approach to addressing the causes and manifestations of these inequities. Individual images obtained through the Noun Project (

Implicit bias
“I would say the societal expectation that scientists should be non-female. This starts out as an expectation from families and school teachers and friends that young women shouldn’t become scientists so that they don’t explore the option. Then it manifests as unconscious bias or even active discrimination in evaluations of woman scientists’ work, as well as in gender-based harassment. I would say that the expectation probably stems in turn from the fact that there are not so many leading women scientists and so when people think of a scientist, they don’t think of somebody female.” (Prof. Dr. Nicola Spaldin, when asked about the biggest challenges facing women scientists)
14
We all hold unconscious biases, shaped by the stereotypes of our wider cultural environment and experiences. While creating such stereotypes is an unavoidable consequence of human cognition, these perceptions often negatively affect women (or, more broadly, anyone adopting behavior typically associated with women
15
,
16
), even if there is no intention of hurt or discrimination
17
. Addressing unconscious bias is difficult and necessary for even the most allied scientist, as most of our stereotypes and schemas operate below the level of awareness.
Unrecognized biases mean that women often face rather different expectations than their male colleagues in the research environment
18
,
19
.
STEM areas (especially engineering and computing) are still widely perceived as “boys’ subjects”
19
. These perceptions are not only ingrained in our society’s understanding of certain topics but also shape society’s
ongoing narrative about who is a scientist and what it looks like to achieve scientific progress
. For example, recent efforts have focused on training artificial intelligence (AI) on societal data in order to predict correlations
20
. If you ask a recently trending image generator
21
for “four computational materials scientists having a research discussion”, the generator will return an image of four older white men around a table (see Fig.
4
). As AI technologies become embedded in every aspect of modern life, it is pivotal that we engage in a critical discussion on how we can avoid using these tools to reinforce harmful stereotypes.

Women’s contributions are often further underrepresented in or excluded from science textbooks
22
, contributing to damaging stereotypes about who is (and who is not) a “scientist”
23
. The widespread perception that women lack academic excellence in comparison to their male peers exists at all levels of the science educational system
24
,
25
,
26
,
27
. The internalization of these stereotypes can lead to lower performance
28
and interest
29
among women and girls in scientific environments, thus compounding the exclusion of women from these spaces.
Women are also deemed less likely to be leaders (by both men and other women) and are less likely to be accepted as leaders
18
,
30
. This directly affects researchers’ success, as students are less likely to choose a female supervisor or join a group with a female primary investigator (PI), believing them to be less capable of helping one’s career progression and less prestigious to work with overall
31
.
The Madame Curie strategy
“... the Madame Curie strategy, as it was termed earlier, of quiet but deliberate over-qualification, personal modesty, strong self-discipline, and infinite stoicism [required to assimilate into a male-dominated workplace].” (Margaret Rossiter)
32
Despite the decades since this coinage,
the “narrow band of acceptable behavior” specially required for women’s success in science
, particularly personality traits associated with modesty and quietude, is a common theme in many women’s accounts of social obstacles to their success
33
. These expectations can both determine how women choose to comport themselves and how they are received—statistically, women are offered fewer opportunities to express their opinion than men, responses and answers given to women are often less detailed and less informative, women are more likely to be interrupted when speaking, and their ideas dismissed (then sometimes, ironically, applauded when a man raises them)
31
,
34
. When women are not in the extreme minority and encouraged to participate meaningfully, there is a measurable positive impact on the productivity and problem-solving capacity of a team, based on increases in conversational turn-taking and cooperativeness and improved collaborative patterns
1
,
35
,
36
,
37
.
Women also tend to underestimate their own skills, especially in environments where gendered stereotypes are active
38
, and this culminates in “biased” self-assessment and reductions in seeking out opportunities, self-promotion, and self-nomination. Successful self-promotion is a crucial tool for succeeding in a research environment and enhancing one’s visibility and perceived competence. While men usually employ this successfully, self-promoting women are found to be less likable or hireable
16
,
18
,
39
,
40
,
41
.
Thus
when women deviate from socially expected behaviors
and adopt traditionally male-associated communication styles,
there is a backlash
12
,
42
,
43
, and noting these more subtle forms of discrimination are often dismissed as personal sensitivity.
Caring responsibilities
“If you were to draw conclusions about faculty demographics from reading confidential letters, you’d conclude that only women have children (as you rarely read about family matters in letters about men).” (Judith D. Singer, quoting a reference letter she had received)
44
Many will point to familial responsibilities as a reason for the delayed progression of women in research positions
45
. Childbearing typically occurs within the crucial and productive early stages of a research career, and women researchers are more likely than their male counterparts to limit their starting or growing of a family in order to further their career
46
. Additionally, women are twice as likely to leave their STEM research positions than men in the years following the birth of their first child, with an attrition rate of 50% compared to 25%
47
. The irony is that balancing work and family is a conundrum universal to all parents, of any gender. So
why are women with children experiencing greater career depression than men with children
47
,
48
?
Despite the evolution of gender roles over the past fifty years, caring roles are still mostly assumed by women
12
, with the COVID-19 pandemic likely to have caused setbacks
49
. There are multiple arguments to be made here: (1) women choose familial obligations over scientific ambition or (2) the social norms and infrastructure of STEM institutions do not adequately support women who both want to pursue a scientific career and choose to have children or care for a relative.
The reality is a messy combination of the two—
women should always be free to choose to have children or to leave scientific careers, but some
have this choice made for them
based upon a lack of meaningful partner engagement or institutional support
. And even if a woman chooses to pursue both paths in life, the assumptions made about a woman’s commitment or responsibilities can result in further exclusion from networking and collaboration opportunities
12
, leading many women with children or caring responsibilities to feel behind their male counterparts
50
.
Lack of role models and visibility
“I don’t think there are any role models I know who managed to balance academic career and a family and life” (Female chemistry PhD student)
11
Lack of female role models
negatively influences self-esteem and
prevents the formation of one’s identity as a woman scientist
51
. The lack of visibility creates the perception that female scientists are isolated and disconnected, which discourages other women from imagining their own place in the research landscape, thereby contributing to the
leaky pipeline
31
.
Representation at conferences can be a particularly powerful way of enhancing visibility and increasing the esteem of women scientists. At the Psi-k conference series (1000+ international participants) in 2010, only 10% of invited speakers were women; this proportion increased slightly to 16% in 2015, which still meant that at least half of the symposia had no women as invited speakers. Encouragingly, due to the (slow) change in the landscape and an increased emphasis by the organizers on an improved balance of representation, in 2022, 25% of invited speakers were women (with the proportion of women being the same for contributed talks as well.)
How do these disadvantages manifest?
The biases and barriers described in the previous section manifest in a range of different measurable ways. It is worth noting that even 1–3% differential effects result in a significant disparity in career progression in the long term, due to cumulative effects
52
, and so addressing these barriers is of utmost importance for fostering an equitable community.
Like their underlying causes, many of these disadvantages can be primary (directly stemming from one of the causes in the previous section) or secondary/tertiary (a resultant effect of historical or institutional inequity). Note that we are not discussing explicit sexism (e.g., inappropriately commenting on a colleague’s physical appearance or personal life), harassment, or abuse.
As a community, we should agree that explicit sexism should be universally condemned, and perpetrators of these actions should be held accountable
. These overt actions are often mistakenly considered the sum-total of sexism in the workplace; here, we choose to elaborate on less clear-cut microaggressions and inequities and the cumulative harm that they cause
53
.
Recognition
“I am more likely to be dismissed when I contribute. It took a lot longer for my efforts to be recognized than my male counterparts. More credence is given to male coworkers’ ideas who have not proven themselves yet.” (Female software engineer)
34
“Several times, I was so excited as I made ‘famous people’ in my field ‘wake up’ or pay attention when I took the podium at a conference (because of the novelty of a woman speaking) or spoke in a meeting; only afterwards to hearing through the grapevine that they just commented on my looks. Honestly, it is a very double-edged sword, being different in any way. Immediate attention is yours, but many times—no matter how well you do and how you perform—you can’t sway the inherent prejudice. I imagine that is the same for any field when you are not mainstream.” (Prof. Kristin Persson, in an interview with the Edison Awards, on the support of the field in the context of being a woman)
54
The under-attribution of women’s contributions to the scientific endeavor is a phenomenon that has been identified and discussed for over 150 years
55
, and is ubiquitous enough to have garnered the name the “Matilda Effect”
56
.
Women often do not receive the same level of recognition for scientific achievements as men, with their contributions more likely to be overlooked, discredited, or attributed to a man
. This under-attribution can manifest in many ways within academia, including the devaluing of women’s contributions to research papers
57
, the association of women authors’ contributions with lower scientific value
24
, the increased likelihood that women will not be credited with authorship for the work they produce (especially if that work has a higher potential to attract significant recognition)
58
, fewer invited papers published by women
59
, and lower rates of success among women in disseminating their work online
60
. The effects of these exclusions are particularly damaging for scientists in the early stages of their careers, for whom recognition often unlocks future opportunities within the broader research community. The following sections detail manifestations of this under-recognition in specific academic contexts.
Citation
“I often notice at conferences that as a woman steps onto the podium, several members of the audience open their devices to check her citation record and H-index. This rarely happens to male speakers.” (Male early career researcher)
Citations are one of the primary means by which academics recognize each other’s work
61
. In keeping with the general trend of the under-recognition of women’s contributions to science, papers written by women suffer from lower citation rates with respect to papers written by men across a wide range of fields

. This discrepancy is more pronounced in fields with a larger gender disparity
74
, or if a man most likely compiled the reference list
73
. In analyzing their own editorial decisions, the Royal Society of Chemistry also found that small gender disparities also exist in the authorship of manuscripts rejected without peer review
74
.
Recommendation letters
“When you read confidential letters, you often find that women are nice, have children, and balance work and career. I’m confident that most of the people who write these things truly believe they’re being helpful, but I’m here to say that they are not!” (Judith D. Singer)
44
Subjective evaluation is a necessary part of recognition – without mechanisms for subjective input, each researcher would be boiled down to citation metrics and funding numbers. However, it was shown that recommendation letters for women researchers are shorter and contain more references to personal traits, fewer to academic achievements, and more “doubt-raisers”, i.e., word or phrase choices that bring into question an applicant’s qualification. These doubt-raisers can be as simple as including irrelevant information or hedging qualifiers (“the candidate
may
make a good colleague”) or they can be as overt as focusing on candidate’s weaknesses, rather than strengths.
75
,
76
,
77
Funding and resources
In a survey led by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), female researchers were significantly less likely to feel that they had access to sufficient resources (both monetary and otherwise) to conduct their work than their male counterparts
50
. And it has been shown that the proportion of women grant awardees is lower than the proportion of women applicants
78
,
79
. Even when overall success rates for men and women are equal, women receive less research funding than men, and are less often listed as principal investigators. Studies show that the language used through the funding allocation process (from the original funding call to instructions and evaluations) is often heavily gendered, with “the quality of researcher” regularly being rated higher for men, even where no gender difference in the “quality of proposal” was found
78
.
Awards and prizes
“In the 27 years that this award has been given, I am the first female recipient. While I would not argue with the worthiness or accomplishments of the previous winners, you would be hard-pressed to convince me that there hasn’t been one woman before me who deserved this honor.” (Prof. Sharon C. Glotzer, upon winning the Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics from the American Physical Society)
Men continue to win a higher proportion of awards for scholarly research than expected based on their representation in the nomination pool (eight times more likely for scholarly awards and three times more likely for young investigator awards)
80
. For example, for awards relevant to our field, where we could collect data on awardees for multiple years: PRACEdays Award (10%), Volker Heine Young Investigator Award finalists (10%). This is the result of the combination of lack of self-promotion and self-nomination of women and lack of seeking out nominations by others. Man-only panels are 50% less likely to choose a female scientist than a panel with one female member, with the gender of the panel chair mattering the most
43
,
81
.
“Women-only” awards and funding (including schemes for those returning from a career break or having caring responsibilities, which predominantly receive applications from women) were originally structured to address award-based inequities, and many provide scientists with non-traditional backgrounds the opportunity to pursue research and increase their visibility. However, siloing women into restricted categories can have several unintended troubling effects, including gender-restricted awards being perceived as “lesser” versions of non-gender-restricted awards, and can over-inflate the statistics of gender equity in awards
24
,
80
. For example, the authors of ref.
80
noted that gender-based awards caused a 55% inflation in the proportion of American Physical Society honors awarded to women in the 2000s. Quotas can be regarded as tokenism, resulting in a backlash from colleagues and negatively impacting the confidence of women
82
.
Student evaluations
“I teach a computational modeling class for undergraduates together with a male colleague. Students regularly address him as ‘Professor’ and address me as ‘Miss’, and once a student told me they had not expected that women could write a code.” (Female assistant professor)
Bias is also present in student evaluations
83
. Female lecturers are more often evaluated based on personality or appearance. As feminine behavioral characteristics are associated with being likeable and approachable, students generally expect more sympathy and social sensitivity from female lecturers
84
, and thus penalize discrepancies from this stereotype, such as ageism, especially for middle-aged women
85
. On the other hand, masculine traits are associated with more competence and better leadership
30
, with male lecturers generally achieving higher student ratings, even in experimental studies that equalize teaching quality
84
,
86
,
87
. While evaluation differences seem to have been decreasing over the past decade, it is a worrying trend that in recent years the proportion of abusive student comments have increased, specifically towards women and those from marginalized groups
88
.
Barriers in working environment
Opportunities for networking
Social networks appear to be more beneficial for men, with similar networks resulting in more job and collaboration opportunities for men than for women
89
. Informal social settings are often dominated by men, due to their higher availability (looser caring commitments), choice of setting (venues perceived as male-dominated, e.g. pubs), or women not being invited to avoid misconception of sexual advances. This exclusion from informal research networks
12
reduces women’s ability to network, feeling of connectedness and inclusion, and ability to gather information through informal channels
34
,
90
. Furthermore, in male-dominated groups gender-linked interactional behaviors are more likely to emerge. Data has shown that male group-leaders are not only less likely to have female graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in their group, but that the ratio gets worse as the prestige of the group (or the PI) increases
91
. This negatively affects the training and networking opportunities available through the most elite environments.
Workload
“There are lots of things expected of you as a woman in academia but there is no equality in terms of what is recognized that contributes to your progression” (Female academic)
11
“In addition, very often women, especially women in STEM fields, are in high demand for service roles in their home institutions as well as in service to the field. Committees for federal funding agencies, technical societies, and within universities, as well as editorial positions, strive to ensure gender balance. Because there are generally fewer women in STEM fields, this means that a smaller number of women are asked to serve on a large number of these positions. This can be overwhelming for women at every stage of their career.” (Prof. Susan Sinnott, in an interview with
Elsevier
)
92
While an organizational culture of overwork results in dissatisfaction for both women and men, women are more likely to suffer negative consequences, from poor health to leaving their academic positions
19
,
93
. Women tend to be asked to do more, more often
94
, and are more likely to agree to (and volunteer to) perform tasks
95
that are less likely to be taken into account during promotion processes (e.g., mentoring, report writing, and note-taking in meetings)
96
. Women also tend to have higher teaching loads
97
. These responsibilities do not necessarily lead to promotion within academia, further exacerbating gender segregation at higher career stages (or vertical gender segregation).
Okay... so what can we do?
The first step in addressing the barriers is to acknowledge the existence of bias and that we are all influenced by stereotypes, either consciously or unconsciously. First and foremost,
raising awareness, educating ourselves, participating in training, and learning to challenge others’ and our own perceptions is critical
. Similarly, while creating action plans based on research and evidence is an important tool to facilitate institutional change, holding ourselves accountable for actually implementing action plans is just as crucial
98
.
Unconscious bias training
consists of raising awareness of gender biases and working actively to make unconscious biases conscious, so that they can be challenged. It is important that this happens both among men and women and targets both students and established researchers, to facilitate culture change in the long term
99
. Experiential training can change perceptions, raise self-awareness, and teach skills to effectively respond to and avert biased situations. Taking these lessons, we can then more consciously and effectively employ EDI-focused toolkits to improve our practices as educators and researchers
100
.
However, unconscious bias training is not a silver bullet: To be effective, the employed training programs have to be well-designed and evidence-based
101
, and augmented with other positive actions. Implicit assumption tests might be useful tools for augmenting training programs
102
. There are tools available for both identifying our own biased thoughts and gender-based wording in letters, assessments and advertisements, including but not limited to:
Implicit Bias across Multiple Dimensions
Gender Bias in Recommendation Letters
Gender Bias in Job Advertisements
“It will also be important to ensure that biases are fought with and for them at every step of the way, EACH and EVERY time they arise, including subtle biases.” (Prof. Giulia Galli, in an interview with AZoM, on barriers facing women in the field)
103
Gender representation metrics
While collecting data in itself does not bring change, having access to good quality statistics is necessary to pinpoint particularly problematic processes or to measure progress in gender representation in research. Accordingly, the collection of information related to gender ratios in various academic contexts (if this can be done anonymously) would contribute to useful benchmarks. For example, it would be useful to quantify and report the proportion of women attending or presenting at conferences, or to publish yearly reports on the gender ratio of authors in scientific journals.
Changing the narrative
STEM research, especially engineering and computing, is often perceived as unengaged from society and mostly involving solitary work. By showing and advertising how these research areas can contribute to communal goals, we can help dismantle these barriers and make the area more appealing to students of more diverse backgrounds. For example, we can emphasize that a wide variety of expertise is necessary to become a STEM scientist, thereby removing the narrow focus on specific math or computing skills, to fight the perception that women are not naturally a good fit in these STEM research areas
19
.
Role models
are critical for encouraging women to join computational materials science and helping to engender a sense of belonging and professional confidence
51
,
104
. To increase the visibility of women in academic contexts, individuals can strive to draw from a diverse range of examples in teaching, or invite a balanced set of speakers at conferences, seminar series, and panel discussions.
However, until we reach parity, we must remember that a 50–50 representation can put an unrealistic burden on the much smaller number of female researchers. Accommodating flexibility in timing and virtual attendance can help to alleviate some of the burden, in addition to incorporating free childcare facilities at conferences for those lacking alternate support.
As a community, we should spearhead a multi-national, multi-institution effort to create a database of female and underrepresented computational materials scientists to amplify lesser-known researchers and distribute the efforts put forth in favor of equity
, and individuals should follow those already involved in the effort of highlighting female scientists (e.g., Dr. Jess Wade and
the 500 Women Scientists Project
or Dr. Adriana Paluszny and
the Watson Forum
).
Mentoring
of young researchers from diverse backgrounds is critical to support those historically excluded from the field. Effective mentoring offers regular contact for an extended time period, with meaningful training offered for mentors
105
. Individuals should promote multi-dimensional mentorship and evaluation in both research and teaching endeavors (for which there are many resources, including ref.
100
), and institutions should develop and support formalized mentoring programs that extend not only to academic development but also adopt a holistic view of professional growth
106
.
“I would suggest trying to find a good mentor, a person who does not just want you to publish a certain number of papers per year for their celebrity, but that instead really tries to help you grow as a person and teaches you, for example, how to give good presentations, how to write papers, how to deal with these difficult situations, and also how to behave as a scientist.” (Prof. Laura Gagliardi, in an interview with AZoM, on advice for young women in the field)
107
Reform of funding and research metrics
We advocate for an innovative reform of the funding landscape to address cumulative bias, such as introducing a “Universal Basic Research grant”, and open discussions on the role and legitimacy of individual awards
43
,
108
. For all grants and awards, we can actively work on widening the nomination pool, and encouraging a wider set of researchers to nominate. We can also create and publish metrics of nominators and nominees at the end of the selection process (thereby raising awareness, practicing transparency, and tracking our progress in addressing bias)
109
. The recommendations of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which intends to stop the practice of correlating publication and journal impact factor to the merits of an individual scientist’s contributions
110
, are especially salient here. Double-blind peer review can also be a helpful tool to lessen the effect of biases
111
.
Improving the working environment
consists of ensuring that job responsibilities can be adjusted (part time, flexible working, leave policy) without carrying a stigma
93
, and that adjustments are made available irrespective of the staff member’s gender. Inclusiveness at the workplace must also extend to informal social interactions, to foster a shared identity and improve career outcomes for women
90
.
For family responsibilities
12
, adjustments consist of providing adequate on-site childcare facilities, promoting shared parental-leave policies, and creating institutional policies for modified duties (with a reduction of non-promotable workload)
112
,
113
.
Sufficient parental leave and professional responsibility adjustments are critical pillars of institutional support
, not only for mothers but for all parents, as well as the cultivation of the norm that
both
parents make use of these policies
46
,
47
,
48
. We point interested readers to the excellent book “Do Babies Matter?: Gender and Family in the Ivory Tower”, for a focused discussion on the topic
46
.
“I can just advise young women to think for themselves, and be confident in what they do not to give up their dreams too easily. And don’t let anybody tell them that they have to choose between a career and a family.” (Prof. Dr. Silvana Botti, in an interview with Friedrich Schiller University Jena, on life balance)
114
Citation metrics
The first step toward citation equity consists of a transparent disclosure and analysis of citation behavior at the individual author and collective journal levels. To this end, we advocate for the inclusion of a citation diversity statement (CDS) at the conclusion of papers, in a similar manner to the inclusion of funding acknowledgments or statements of conflicts of interest. The CDS is a simple acknowledgment of the importance of citation diversity and a self-reporting of the gender-breakdown of a paper’s citations
115
. It effectively places each paper in the gendered context of the knowledge base on which it relies, and serves as a tool through which authors and readers can examine their own citation practices. A number of journals have embraced the CDS, including the
Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
70
and all journals published by the Biomedical Engineering Society
116
. Editors at the
Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
reported a clear reduction of gender imbalances in citations in the year following the journal’s embrace of the CDS
117
. For readers interested in calculating and reporting their own citation statistics, several publicly available tools exist that are both
journal-specific
70
and
journal-general
118
.
Final remarks
Gender equity is a nuanced and complex topic, with enough aspects to fill several graduate theses. We don’t set out to be exhaustive on this topic, but to provide summaries and resources for those seeking them within the field of computational materials research. For the interested reader, we suggest similar perspectives from the field of Neuroscience
9
,
119
, or the comprehensive reports of the American Association of University Women
19
and the Workshop on Gender Equity in Materials Science and Engineering
12
.
We also note that this perspective is but one (incomplete) lens through which to view broader issues of bias and discrimination within STEM. Left out of this conversation are scientists with intersecting marginalized identities. Trans and non-binary scientists, for example, face unique challenges not fully covered by our discussion. We look forward to future work that will foreground these communities and push academia toward an ever-more equitable landscape.
Citation diversity statement
In writing this paper, we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, and other factors. We use databases that store the probability of a name being carried by people of different genders to mitigate our own citation bias at the intersection of name and identity. Based on the databases used, the set of names assigned the “woman” label will contain a predominance of women and the set of names assigned the “man” label will contain a predominance of men, but both sets may also contain other genders. By this measure (supplemented by manual research of some individual authors and excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper, and papers whose authors’ first names could not be determined), our references contain 46.1% woman(first author)/woman(last author), 15.7% man/woman, 24.5% woman/man, and 13.7% man/man categorization. This method is limited in that names, pronouns, and social media profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity. Furthermore, probabilistic studies of names cannot be used to detect citation costs that are specific to intersex, non-binary, or transgender people who are out to a large number of their colleagues. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable practices in science.

Research and games both require the participant to make a series of choices. Active learning is a process borrowed from machine learning for algorithmically making choices that has become increasingly used to accelerate materials research. While this process may seem opaque to researchers outside the field of machine learning, examining active learning in games provides an accessible way to showcase the process and its virtues. Here, we examine active learning through the lens of the game Wordle to both explain the active learning process and describe the types of research questions that arise when using active learning for materials research.
A challenge common across research, whether computational or experimental, is deciding which experiment to perform next. While many of these choices are made ad hoc by a researcher in front of an instrument, there is a community, with roots tracing back centuries, that studies how to optimally select experiments
1
. Widely used strategies include one factor at a time (OFAT) optimization and selecting experiments evenly across the available parameter space (e.g., grid-based searching). In contrast with strategies that select all experiments before performing an experimental campaign, active learning is a branch of machine learning in which experiments are selected sequentially using knowledge gained from all prior experiments
2
,
3
. Encouragingly, recent studies have reported that active learning outperforms both design of experiments that define a set of experiments at the outset and experiments guided by human intuition
4
,
5
. Indeed, examples of active learning in materials research have blossomed in recent years
6
,

,
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
. One area that has especially shown a spotlight on this trend is autonomous experimentation in which a robotic system is used to carry out experiments that are chosen by active learning
12
. Such systems have emerged in a broad range of fields including mechanics
13
,
14
, biology
15
,
16
, chemistry
17
,
18
, nanotechnology
19
, and microscopy
20
,
21
. In light of these advances in autonomous experimentation, and the demonstrated advantage of active learning, it is increasingly clear that there are tremendous opportunities for applying concepts of active learning in a wide range of research fields.
Despite the benefits of adopting active learning in research, there are still hurdles associated with learning how to implement active learning and communicating the advantages to researchers far removed from the fields of machine learning or data-driven science. Interestingly, the introduction and rapid popularization of the word game Wordle produced by Josh Wardle provides a fascinating platform for overcoming both of these challenges. In Wordle, the player has six guesses to identify a specific five-letter word. After each guess, feedback is provided about whether each letter is present in the target word and whether the letter is in the correct location. Part of the popularity of this game stems from the fact that it can only be played once a day, which further raises the stakes of each guess. At a glance, this game shares some extremely salient connections to experimental selection during a research campaign. First, a Wordle player can guess any five-letter word, meaning that there is a large, but finite, parameter space that is known ahead of time. This is often true in a research campaign where the knobs that can be turned are known, even if their importance has yet to be determined. Second, the budget of available experiments is limited—to six by the programmer in Wordle—and by the natural constraints of time and other resources in research. Finally, the goal of Wordle, to identify the target word, mirrors the goal of finding a maximum or minimum property in some parameter space, which is a common task in many research studies. Despite these similarities, the goals of Wordle and research often have meaningful differences. For example, a researcher may not know when they have found the best experiment, the goal of a research campaign is often to learn the behavior of some property rather than simply find its extrema, and there can be more than one best experiment in a parameter space. Those caveats aside, the task of optimization is extremely common and an obvious first step in any more complex research goal.
Given the similarities between Wordle and research campaigns, it is our hope that one can gain insight into active learning and motivation for adopting it more generally by studying active learning in Wordle. Taking inspiration from a Bayesian optimization formalization of active learning, we can lay out an iterative cycle for selecting and interpreting guesses (Fig.
1A
). The first task is to define a surrogate model that encompasses our knowledge about the system. As part of this, we must define the parameter space, which for Wordle, amounts to identifying all valid five-letter words, of which we identified 12,478. To illustrate why active learning is needed to play Wordle, given a parameter space this large, selecting guesses uniformly at random from the available words means that the player will win only 0.05% of the time. In a materials research campaign, defining the parameter space is akin to identifying all available materials and the valid ranges of experimental or computational parameters that can be tuned. Once we have defined the parameter space, we need to build a surrogate model of our belief about the space. In Wordle, this can be the belief of whether a given word is possibly correct, which is initially uniform for all available words. This surrogate model is implemented as a look up table in which each word is assigned a probability that it is the correct word. If a given word is ruled out then its probability is set to 0 and the rest of the space is renormalized. More complex and versatile surrogate models, such as Gaussian process regressions, can be constructed that leverage the idea that points close to one another in parameter space should behave similarly, but a simple look up table is sufficient for illustrating the process. In either case, this surrogate model is updated as experiments are performed, which in Wordle amounts to ruling out words that are inconsistent with the responses to prior guesses. To show the value of iteratively incorporating this knowledge, if a player randomly selects words from this ever narrowing field of possibilities, they will win Wordle 85% of the time. This striking shift in outcomes illustrates the value of selecting each experiment using all available knowledge.
Fig. 1: Playing Wordle using active learning.
A
Diagram showing the anatomy of active learning in a game of Wordle. A surrogate model describes the present belief about the system. During the first turn (
N
= 0), all words are assumed to be candidates for the winning word. Next, a decision-making policy is employed to quantify the relative value of each word. Subsequently, the highest value word is guessed and the response is used to update the surrogate model. This process continues until the correct word is found or the player loses.
B
Ranked order evaluation of three decision-making policies for all words. Decision policies include ‘Eliminate’ in which each word’s value is estimated by the number of words that could be eliminated if it was guessed, ‘Knowledge’ in which the value of each word is determined by the number of unique outcomes that could arise from guessing the word, and ‘Letters’ in which the value of each word is based on the abundance of its letters in the catalog of words.
C
Probability of different outcomes from playing Wordle guided by different strategies. Color indicates the number of guesses required to find the correct answer with red indicating that seven or more guesses were required. Strategies are either ‘Hard’ in that they require that words are selected from those that have not been ruled out or ‘Normal’ in that all words can be selected. ‘Random’ indicates that words were selected uniformly at random. The code used to produce these results can be found at

Randomly guessing from the words that remain in contention takes advantage of the information from the results of previous guesses, but not the information embodied by the parameter space itself. A major goal in active learning is determining the expected value of a given guess. In a materials research campaign, this could be related to a materials property, such as its Seebeck coefficient or fracture toughness. In Wordle, the value of a given word is related to how much it helps identify the correct word. Given this, there are many different ways to value a potential guess (Fig.
1B
). Three examples include (1) assigning a score to each word based on how common the letters in the word are, (2) prioritizing words that allow the player to eliminate the most words, or (3) targeting words that lead to the most possible outcomes and therefore the most unique information. Each choice represents a decision-making policy that assigns a value to any given point in parameter space based on the current state of the surrogate model. Here, we find that selecting words based on how many possible words they eliminate or how much information they provide leads to victory >90% of the time, showing a ~5% improvement over randomly selecting from the available words. However, choosing based on the commonality of letters actually performs worse than randomly selecting from potential winners, highlighting the importance of choosing a decision-making policy wisely. As shown by this example, the benefits and risks associated with choosing different decision-making policies is both highly impactful on the pace of learning and a fascinating lens through which to view materials research.
Part of the value of active learning is that it opens the door for the algorithm to make choices based on relationships inside the data that might be difficult for human users to intuit. Conceptually, this can amount to selecting experiments that themselves are not likely to lead to high performance but improve chances for future success. To apply this concept in Wordle, consider choosing between two words as potential guesses: word 1 has some probability of being a winning word but would provide little actionable information if it is not the target word. In contrast, word 2 has already been ruled out from being a winning word, but the response from this word would on average greatly increase the player’s chance of success by providing actionable information such as ruling out other words. This latter approach, namely selecting the words with the most possible outcomes even among those that have been ruled out produces success a remarkable 99.7% of the time. This interesting result can be conceptualized as coming from the dichotomy between exploration and exploitation in acknowledging that if your budget is known, which of course in Wordle it is, it is beneficial to spend earlier guesses exploring parameter space before focusing on regions in which success is expected. In active learning, there are decision-making policies that naturally balance exploration and exploitation such as the expected improvement policy that selects points in parameter space that are judged to be most likely to increase, in the case of maximization, the current value of the maximum.
While analyzing the algorithmic process of sequentially selecting guesses for Wordle provides insight into the process for materials development, it also raises a key shortcoming of purely algorithmic active learning. The discussed algorithms assume that all words initially have an equal chance of being correct, which discounts the bias against esoteric words in the target word selection by the game’s creator. There are two ways one could envision trying to take advantage of this information. First, one could imagine including information about word popularity as prior knowledge in the active learning loop. This could amount to, for example, weighting the initial probability of each word in proportion to how often it is used in literature. It is also worth emphasizing that prior knowledge has already been introduced by only considering combinations of five-letter words that are English words. Second, this could also be dynamically addressed using human-in-the-loop (HITL) active learning in which the human-machine partnership is leveraged to further accelerate the learning process. Generally, HITL entails finding a productive way to combine the best attributes of each member of the partnership. This has been productively used to outperform algorithms or humans alone in fields including radiology
22
and robotics
23
. In the present example, HITL could entail using the algorithm to identify a short list of high value words and allow the human to select from these words as a way of considering the relative popularity of each word. Advances in this area are particularly interesting in materials research where the insight of researchers may be difficult to quantify but could be productively employed through such a partnership.
Formalizing the selection of choices, whether in games or materials research, forces one to define and consider the goals and important information present in a system. Because much materials research still relies on relatively simple heuristics for experimental selection, it is our hope that this comment, and the broader efforts to introduce active learning into materials research that it reflects, will spark the curiosity of new researchers and engage them in the process of looking more deeply at how experiments are selected. Such interest can be complemented by easy-to-implement active learning packages in a variety of programming languages and high quality tutorial articles

. Along these lines, the code used to generate the results presented in this work are posted at
https://github.com/kabrownlab/wordle
. Perhaps most importantly, the incorporation of active learning elevates the conversation and thoughts in the research enterprise. For example, rather than thinking about which word to select in Wordle, instead the player thinks about what defines a word’s value. This level of discourse centered around selecting and refining decision-making policies and surrogate models is an exciting prospect for the materials community.

Renewable energy applications largely rely on transition metal catalysts. Similar to organocatalysts,
p
-block elements exhibit transition-metal-like catalytic performances. Si Zhou and co-workers review the latest advances in
p
-block elements as catalysts for energy conversion to deeply understand the concept of metal-free catalysis and establish the design principles for
p
-block catalysts.
Catalysts are an engine of human society. Catalysis is a prerequisite for life in biological systems, and is indispensable for the industrial conversion of chemical feedstocks into valuable products, such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Advances in catalysis are also critical for the realization of carbon neutralization. Traditionally, there are two types of catalysts, namely, metals and enzymes. The metal species with incompletely filled
d
orbitals serve as active sites for reactions to occur. It was not until 2000 that the third type of catalyst called the asymmetric organocatalyst was developed
1
,
2
, which constitutes small organic molecules containing mainly carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, but no metal species. These catalysts are environmentally friendly, and their production is inexpensive. Moreover, organocatalysts can be used to drive asymmetric catalysis, which is in high demand for the production of pharmaceuticals. Benjamin List and David MacMillan, the scientists who conducted pioneering work in organocatalysis, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021. Their seminal work clarified the principles for inducing reactivity and controlling reaction pathways in organocatalysts. Their achievements have opened new avenues in chemistry toward broadening the catalytic application scope of main group species, which are greener and more efficient (Fig.
1
).

In parallel, the rapid progress of synthetic technologies has facilitated the fabrication of various inorganic materials. With the development of nanomaterials, tremendous attention has been focused on low-dimensional materials with peculiar geometric and electronic structures, which allow the design of novel catalysts for renewable energy applications. With unique structures and ultrahigh atom utilization, efficient catalysis based on these novel nanostructures may be achieved with reduced consumption of or without transition metals (mostly precious metals such as Pt, Pd, and Ru). Some low-dimensional materials made of
p
-block elements, such as group-IV and group-V monolayers (graphene, silicene, phosphorene, etc.) and carbon nanotubes, also exhibit unexpected capability for catalytic energy conversion. This raises the question of whether
p
-block materials can exhibit both outstanding catalytic performance and practical applicability. As mentioned above, the activity of transition metals stems from their incompletely filled
d
orbitals, endowing tunability of oxidation states and the ability to form complex intermediates with reagents. The
d
-band theory, proposed by Jens K. Nørskov, has been widely adopted to explain the activity trend of transition metals on the basis of the correlation between reactivity and the
d
-band center of a metal
3
. In contrast,
p
-block elements possess limited oxidation states. Thus, the mechanism for triggering the activity and the principles for designing
p
-block catalysts are considerably different from those for transition-metal-based catalysts, but similar to those for organocatalysts to some extent.
In
npj Computational Materials
, Si Zhou and co-workers attempted to address the above question by reviewing the latest advances in experimental and theoretical explorations of
p
-block elements as catalysts for clean energy applications. They focused on the situation wherein
p
-block elements (carbon, silicon, oxygen, boron, and phosphorus) serve as active sites, and endeavored to elucidate the regulation of
p
-orbital-dominated catalysts by a systematic survey of relevant computational results.
Carbon-based materials are the most commonly reported metal-free catalysts for energy conversion. Remarkable electrocatalytic activity has been widely observed in carbon materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes doped with heteroatoms, incorporating structural defects or encapsulating metals. The activity can be generally explained by the change in charge density and electron affinity for the surface carbon atoms induced by the dopants, defects, or metal fillers. Zhou et al. proposed a concept to understand the
p
-orbital-dominated reactivity in terms of the occupancy and energy level of
p
states
4
. Taking encapsulated graphitic carbon nanospheres and nanotubes as an example, they attributed the catalytic activity to the breaking of the π conjugation of carbon networks, resulting in partially filled
p
z
orbitals for carbon atoms, thereby rendering them with the ability to withdraw or donate electrons from the reagents
5
. Some parameters such as local charge density,
p
-band center, and work function are demonstrated to be good descriptors for the binding capability and catalytic activity of carbon species.
Similar correlations have also been found for other
p
-block materials
6
,
7
,
8
. The carbon, boron, silicon, and phosphorus atoms, when not in perfect
sp
2
or
sp
3
hybridization, have their
p
-state electrons activated and exhibit reactivity that is tunable with the occupancy and energy levels of
p
orbitals. Such electronic structure-activity relationships are referred to as the “
p
-band model”. This simple concept provides guidance for activating
p
-block species through band structure engineering, according to which some predicted carbon hybrid electrocatalysts have been corroborated with those determined by experiments
9
.
Many other materials exhibit a
p
-orbital-dominated reactivity. However, the large discrepancies among different
p
-block elements result in diverse material structures, and each system may follow a unique reaction mechanism. It would be difficult to establish a unified concept for understanding the design principles for all types of
p
-block catalysts. Inspired by the achievements in organocatalysis, both experimental and theoretical investigators have been continuously exploring
p
-block-element-mediated reactions to develop inexpensive and eco-friendly catalysts for carbon neutralization.

Theoretical chemistry
While the theory of imperfections in solids is firmly established, procedures for first-principles calculations of defect quantities continue to evolve. A plethora of ad hoc correction schemes is being replaced by sophisticated self-consistent procedures that will enable more quantitative predictions of the formation energies of defect species and their spectroscopic signatures.
The formation of defects in crystals is a natural consequence of chemical thermodynamics—the balance between the enthalpic cost of perturbing the atomic bonding environments and the entropic gain of introducing an ensemble of imperfections.
The key quantity that determines, in equilibrium, if a particular defect species will be abundant or rare is the free energy of formation, Δ
G
f
. The concentration (
n
d
) can be decomposed into contributions from enthalpy and vibrational entropy
$${n}_{d}={N}_{{\rm{site}}}g\exp \left(-\frac{{{\Delta }}{H}_{f}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}T}\right)\exp \left(\frac{{{\Delta }}{S}_{f}}{{k}_{{\rm{B}}}}\right),$$
(1)
where
N
site
and
g
denote the number and degeneracy of available sites in the host crystal. The enthalpy change dominates under standard conditions, so the more burdensome vibrational term
1
is most often neglected.
The first objective in defect modelling is to calculate Δ
H
f
as accurately as possible, which can be achieved in a number of ways, as illustrated in Fig.
1
. Due to the exponential factor in Eq. (
1
), the prediction of defect concentrations is sensitive to the quality of the underlying energy terms. My brief perspective on major developments in this field is given below. I apologise in advance to the many contributions that are overlooked in this synopsis (e.g. see ref.
2
for a more thorough overview).

Early 20th century—theoretical foundations
The theory of lattice dynamics developed by Born and others described the motion of atoms around their equilibrium crystallographic positions. However, what if atoms left its ideal position and wandered into an interstitial position? A classical numerical procedure for calculating the formation energy of such point defects in ionic solids was proposed by Frenkel in 1926
3
. The semi-classical (continuum) Mott–Littleton method for charged defects energetics was reported in 1938
4
, which was later expanded into a more general framework for multi-region embedded crystal calculations
5
. The extensive theoretical infrastructure subsequently developed for describing the electronic structure of donor and acceptor levels in semiconductors was reviewed by Pantelides in 1978
6
.
Late 20th century—practical solutions
The combination of efficient algorithms to solve the Kohn–Sham equations and massively parallel computing enabled the modern era of computational materials science. Two types of approaches were developed for modelling charged point defects in crystals.
Those based on embedding potentials (a dilute defect in a host matrix as shown in Fig.
1
c) offer some advantages, but remain technically challenging to set up and analyse
7
. A self-consistent Green’s function procedure for treating defect perturbations was already reported in 1979
8
and quickly adapted to describe the deep states associated with transition metal impurities in Si using a local density functional
9
.
The alternative, and more widely employed, supercell approach benefits from the robust infrastructure for calculation of crystals within periodic boundary conditions (Fig.
1
d). The principal issue in describing charged defects is the electrostatic interaction between repeating centres. The long-range Coulomb interaction depends on the defect charge
q
, their spatial arrangement, and the dielectric response of the host
ϵ
(
r
). The standard solution is to introduce a homogeneous ‘jellium’ background charge to enforce charge neutrality in each repeat unit and ensure convergent Coulomb energy. This fix results in a shift in the average electrostatic potential and total energy of the defective supercell that must be corrected to become useful (Fig.
2
).

Leslie and Gillan
10
showed how to properly account for a point charge
q
interacting with its periodic images through an isotropic dielectric medium. The approach was expanded by Makov and Payne
11
to include the quadrupole moment (
Q
). In practice,
Q
cannot be determined from the defect charge distribution. Defects come in many forms and their wavefunctions may be localised or delocalised and are invariably coupled to the screening host charge. In addition, the limitations of a given density functional can require further correction terms, such as valence and conduction band edge shifts, to reduce the divide between modelling and measurement
12
.
Exciting results and insights were gained using these methods, especially in the area of metal oxides. There were problems, however. Research groups performing similar simulations would obtain different conclusions depending on the flavour of corrections that were employed; the curious reader can look into the case of defects in ZnO. In my opinion, the absolute defect energetics reported during this era should be taken with a pinch of salt.
Early 21st century—robust predictions
To tackle these issues, a new set of correction schemes emerged for supercell calculations. Freysoldt et al.
13
modelled the defect charge as a Gaussian distribution in an isotropic medium. There were other efforts to include anistropic dielectric screening
14
,
15
. Kumagai and Oba
16
refined these approaches with a more practical alignment procedure, based on atomic site potentials, that accounts for the full anisotropic low-frequency dielectric response.
More recent developments have moved away from a posteriori corrections of the total energy to direct modification of the underlying self-consistent calculation. The advantages are that the total energy and electronic eigenvalues can be corrected directly and more physical long-range dielectric screening can be incorporated.
A self-consistent potential correction was proposed by da Silva et al. in 2021
17
. The change in potential, from either a reference pristine supercell or neutral defect, is used to correct for the difference between the periodic and isolated charged defect. One limitation in the current formalism is the use of an isotropic dielectric constant; however, spatial variation is allowed in one direction for the case of slabs. In contrast, the image charge correction proposed by Suo et al.
18
avoids the input of a dielectric constant at all and is instead based on the self-consistent charge density difference between charged and neutral defects, which already contains the relevant screening information. Both approaches show promising behaviour for a series of test cases including NaCl and MgO.
An issue not addressed in these two recent works is how to incorporate the low-frequency dielectric response involving ion displacements. This is critical for accurately describing defect transitions, which may be excited optically or thermally
19
. Suo et al.
18
suggest introducing a Gaussian broadening scheme to capture ion displacements, but this remains to be implemented and tested.
An entirely different approach has been taken by Xiao et al.
20
in a move away from the standard jellium model to consider charge compensation by realistic valence or conduction band edge states of the host crystal. Their self-consistent correction scheme, which avoids the artificial jellium background, is intuitive for traditional semiconductors where charged defects are compensated by electrons/holes, but less so for cases where ionic compensation dominates
21
,
22
. The approach gives good agreement with conventional methods and can also describe defects in low dimensional structures.
This new wave of research and development in the field is exciting and will further increase the predictive power of first-principles calculations of materials. A family of reliable and general correction schemes for charged defects will allow us to confidently tackle important scientific challenges such as equilibrium defect distributions, defect vibrations, and non-equilibrium charge transitions. They will also support more robust workflows for defect automation that can be used to identify new behaviour and physical trends in imperfect crystals.

Computational materials science and engineering has emerged as an interdisciplinary subfield spanning materials science and engineering, condensed matter physics, chemistry, mechanics and engineering in general. Modern materials research often requires a close integration of computation and experiments in order to fundamentally understand the materials structures and properties and their relation to synthesis and processing. A number of computational methods and tools at different spatio-temporal scales are now well established, ranging from electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory,

and Monte Carlo techniques,

to continuum macroscopic approaches. Over the last few years, computational materials activities have been steadily moving from technique development and purely computational studies of materials towards discovering and designing new materials guided by computation, machine learning and data mining or by a closely tied combination of computational predictions and experimental validation. This movement is being further accelerated by the recent initiatives by various government agencies in the United States, Europe, China and other countries to pursue the materials genome initiative,

integrated computational materials engineering

13
as well as the ‘Big Data’ initiative.
The design of materials guided by computation is expected to lead to the discovery of new materials, reduction of materials development time and cost, and the rapid evolution of new materials into products.
14
New materials discovered or designed by computation or a combination of computation and experiment can be new materials chemistry such as new combinations of atom species, molecules and point defects. They can be new structures of a material of known chemistry including new crystal structures, new microstructures, new interfacial (interface or surface) structures, or new artificial heterostructures or composites. Materials may also exhibit dramatically enhanced properties under an external potential or field or constraint, e.g., mechanical strain or stress or electric field or magnetic field.
The new journal,
npj Computational Materials
, aims to publish timely original research or perspective and review articles on the design of materials guided by theory/computation, by a combination of theory/computation and experiment, the validation of the computationally predicted/designed materials by experiments, and/or the fundamental understanding of their structures and properties. The focus is on design and discovery of new materials rather than on purely computational technique improvement or incremental theoretical understanding of materials structures and properties, i.e., the discovery of new materials with desired properties will be the central theme of this journal. All types of materials systems are of interest, including both hard and soft materials used in electronic, photonic, memory, medical, magnetic and energy conversion and storage devices, as well as structural materials in automobile and aerospace applications. Although much of the focus in this field to date has been on crystalline materials, we expect that analogues developments in amorphous materials, or on liquids such as electrolytes or melts, where the lack of order adds significantly to the complexity.
A key component to the success of materials design is the availability of materials data. Materials data can be generated through computation or experiments or a combination of computation and experiments, including high-throughput calculations of materials structures and properties and high throughput, combinatorial experimental measurements. In cases where experimental data are not available or very difficult or impossible to measure, computation is not only desirable but also the only means. For example, nanoscale, metastable precipitates are primarily responsible for the mechanical strengthening of many structural materials. Since many of these metastable precipitates are not thermodynamically stable in isolation, their structural and property data as well as the interfacial energy between them and the matrix can only be obtained through computation. The large sets of data and databases can then be mined and analysed for the discovery of novel materials. The journal is interested in publishing original articles on how materials data are generated or how they could be used in materials design or to guide materials design.
npj Computational Materials
will also publish articles on the development of new computational tools that allow or facilitate the prediction/design of new materials including significant advances in high-throughput computational techniques, machine learning and data mining or multiscale tools or integrated computational materials engineering methodology.

Understanding of materials is the prerequisite for materials design. The journal therefore also welcomes the submission of manuscripts on the fundamental understanding of the structures and properties of predicted/designed materials through a combination of computation and experiments. The special emphasis will be on experimental verification of the theoretical predication and feedback to theory. For example, the broad range of imaging and spectroscopic tools provide information on materials structure and functionality on macroscopically averaged, mesoscopic and local levels. In particular, atomically resolved imaging techniques based on electron and scanning probe microscopy can provide structural and property information on atomic level, whereas scattering techniques provide similar information in k space. Systematic analysis and curation of these types of data will allow construction of libraries of structure–property relationships at atomic levels, effectively sampling regions in the chemical space of a system. This knowledge can then be incorporated in theoretical models, e.g., by providing realistically observed (as opposed to all theoretically possible) defect configurations and providing refinement of theoretical model parameters.
Finally, the ultimate goal is to synthesize materials of interest. While theoretical methods can suggest candidate materials with required properties and provide insight into their thermodynamic stability, actual synthesis can be affected by many other factors, and for many materials, is more of art than science. For example, recent studies in the field of organic molecule design suggest that for many materials the use of big data and crowdsourcing approaches to tap into collective expert opinions can allow estimating the difficulty of synthesis. Of interest is the extension of these approaches to inorganic materials, using both real-time process monitoring and correlative analysis of materials microstructure versus process parameters and development of text analytic methods that will allow mining similar information from published body of work.
In summary, design and discovery of materials guided by theory and computation is an emerging field of materials science. The journal,
npj Computational Materials
, will provide an international platform for the community to exchange ideas and findings. It will report the most recent discoveries and advances of the field and provide its perspectives for future opportunities and challenges.

The University of Oxford and Ludwig Cancer Research are adding to our growing group of cancer researchers. We are seeking individuals at early to mid-stage career stages (Assistant or Associate Professor level).
The University of Oxford is a world-class research environment which has made a substantial commitment to biomedical research. The Ludwig Cancer Institute is part of the Nuffield Department of Medicine situated within the Old Road Campus in Headington Oxford, and forms the focus of cancer research throughout the University. We closely collaborate with other departments and institutes on the campus including the Kennedy Institute (immunology), the Jenner Institute (vaccines), the Big Data Institute (computational biology), IDRM (developmental biology), STRUBI (structural biology) and the Target Discovery Institute amongst many others. We also have ready access to investigators working throughout the University in areas such as chemistry, mathematics, physics and biology.
The Ludwig Institute is an international organisation that supports 3 core-funded branches (Oxford, Princeton and Lausanne) as well as individual investigators throughout the world. Its aim is to advance our basic knowledge of cancer and apply this towards improvement in cancer care. The Oxford branch has particular expertise in epigenetics and the development of novel technologies to study this problem. We are especially interested in growing our expertise in epitranscriptomics, RNA biology, single-cell/spatial approaches, microenvironment (especially myeloid biology), and structural epigenetics, but are open to any area of novel investigation. We encourage cross-disciplinary science which brings together different approaches, including close collaboration between basic scientists and clinical colleagues in the nearby cancer hospital.
Our research is well-supported through a core funding mechanism, which provides support for PI salary, Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows and consumables. We have access to state of the art core facilities including high resolution microscopy, cryoEM, ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry and CRISPR screening.
Candidates should hold a relevant PhD level qualification and are expected to develop independent research programs. Evidence of productivity in publications and collaboration is a key criteria. We offer competitive salaries, strong institutional commitment, comprehensive benefits, and an outstanding work and life environment with family friendly policies, an on- campus nursery and easy access to London and European cities.
Interested parties should prepare the following materials as PDF documents and submit the materials to our departmental coordinator:

MODEL, GUESS, CHECK: Wordle as a primer on active learning for materials research
Research and games both require the participant to make a series of choices. Active learning is a process borrowed from machine learning for algorithmically making choices that has become increasingly used to accelerate materials research. While this process may seem opaque to researchers outside the field of machine learning, examining active learning in games provides an accessible way to showcase the process and its virtues. Here, we examine active learning through the lens of the game Wordle to both explain the active learning process and describe the types of research questions that arise when using active learning for materials research.

-Block elements for catalysis
Renewable energy applications largely rely on transition metal catalysts. Similar to organocatalysts,
p
-block elements exhibit transition-metal-like catalytic performances. Si Zhou and co-workers review the latest advances in
p
-block elements as catalysts for energy conversion to deeply understand the concept of metal-free catalysis and establish the design principles for
p
-block catalysts.

Correcting the corrections for charged defects in crystals
While the theory of imperfections in solids is firmly established, procedures for first-principles calculations of defect quantities continue to evolve. A plethora of ad hoc correction schemes is being replaced by sophisticated self-consistent procedures that will enable more quantitative predictions of the formation energies of defect species and their spectroscopic signatures.

Review
Reviews narratively summarize recent advances in the scientific literature within a given research field. Although Reviews should be recognized as scholarly by specialists in the field, they should be written to inform non-specialist readers. Reviews should be presented using simple prose, avoiding excessive jargon and technical detail. The scope of a Review should be broad enough that it is not dominated by the work of a single laboratory, and particularly not by the author's own work. Reviews include received and accepted dates and are peer reviewed.
Please note that all systematic review types, scoping reviews, and meta-analyses, should be submitted as Articles, not Reviews.
Reviews are formatted as follows:

Journal Metrics
DORA: The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment
Springer Nature is a
signatory
of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). Because small numbers of highly cited articles can have outsized influence on certain citation measures like the 2-year Journal Impact Factor (JIF) (see below for definition), Springer Nature believes that these citation measures are not necessarily measures of journal quality, and that authors and readers should consider a range of metrics when evaluating journals to read and publish in.
Article metrics such as number of downloads, citations and online attention are available from each article page, and provide an overview of the attention received by a paper.
Citation Impact 2023
Journal Impact Factor: 9.4
5-year Journal Impact Factor: 11.5
Immediacy Index: 2.5
Eigenfactor® Score: 0.02176
Article Influence Score: 3.1
Speed 2023
Submission to first editorial decision (median days): 11
Submission to acceptance (median days): 181
Usage 2023
Downloads: 1,990,379
Altmetric mentions: 1,676
Definitions
The metric definitions below are shared by all Springer Nature journals.
Citation Impact
Journal Impact Factor
The Journal Impact Factor is defined as all citations to the journal in the current JCR year to items published in the previous two years, divided by the total number of scholarly items (these comprise articles, reviews, and proceedings papers) published in the journal in the previous two years. Though not a strict mathematical average, the Journal Impact Factor provides a functional approximation of the mean citation rate per citable item. A Journal Impact Factor of 1.0 means that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited one time. A Journal Impact Factor of 2.5 means that, on average, the articles published one or two years ago have been cited two and a half times. The citing works may be articles published in the same journal. However, most citing works are from different journals, proceedings, or books indexed in Web of Science Core Collection. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
5-year Journal Impact Factor
The 5-year journal Impact Factor, available from 2007 onward, is the average number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year. It is calculated by dividing the number of citations in the JCR year by the total number of articles published in the five previous years. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Immediacy Index
The Immediacy Index is the average number of times an article is cited in the year it is published. The journal Immediacy Index indicates how quickly articles in a journal are cited. The aggregate Immediacy Index indicates how quickly articles in a subject category are cited. The Immediacy Index is calculated by dividing the number of citations to articles published in a given year by the number of articles published in that year. Because it is a per-article average, the Immediacy Index tends to discount the advantage of large journals over small ones. However, frequently issued journals may have an advantage because an article published early in the year has a better chance of being cited than one published later in the year. Many publications that publish infrequently or late in the year have low Immediacy Indexes. For comparing journals specializing in cutting-edge research, the immediacy index can provide a useful perspective. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Eigenfactor® Score
The Eigenfactor Score calculation is based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year, but it also considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals. References from one article in a journal to another article from the same journal are removed, so that Eigenfactor Scores are not influenced by journal self-citation. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Article Influence Score
The Article Influence Score determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication. It is calculated by multiplying the Eigenfactor Score by 0.01 and dividing by the number of articles in the journal, normalized as a fraction of all articles in all publications. This measure is roughly analogous to the 5-Year Journal Impact Factor in that it is a ratio of a journal’s citation influence to the size of the journal’s article contribution over a period of five years. (Source:
Clarivate Analytics
)
Speed
Submission to first editorial decision
This measures the median time in days from when the journal receives a manuscript submission to when the submission is either sent out for peer review or rejected.
Submission to acceptance
This measures the median time in days from when the journal receives a manuscript submission to when the submission is accepted. This includes all peer review and can also include time in revision.
Usage
Downloads
Downloads reflect the number of times full text or PDF versions of articles are accessed directly from the journal website and Springer Link. Downloads are defined as HTML, LookInside, PDF, and Epub clicks. Please note that this does not include article downloads from mirror databases such as PubMed Central. These download counts comply with the COUNTER5 standard. COUNTER5 is the fifth iteration of the “Code of Practice,” from
Counter Metrics
, which is a not-for-profit organization financially sustained by its global community of members, including libraries, consortia, publishers, aggregators, and technology providers.
Altmetric mentions
Total number of mentions (e.g. X, Facebook, Reddit, Blogs, News articles, Policy documents, and Faculty of 1000 reviews) for articles published in the specified timeframe, as provided by
Altmetric
.

About Nature Portfolio
Nature Portfolio is here to serve the research community by publishing its most significant discoveries—findings that advance knowledge and address some of the greatest challenges that we face as a society today. Our journals publish not only primary research but also reviews, critical comment, news and analysis.
From
Nature
—the leading international weekly journal of science first published in 1869—to selective subject-specific subscription journals including
Nature Genetics
and
Nature Physics
and broad open-access journals such as
Nature Communications
and
Scientific Reports
, there is a home for your research within our family of journals. We're committed to providing more options for authors in the open access arena too. The
Communications journals
, a group of high-quality, selective, open access multidisciplinary journals, published their first articles in 2018. Our Nature Reviews titles showcase authoritative, accessible and significant review content. High-quality graphics and enhanced content provide context and explanation, whatever your discipline.
Every month, nine million people read news, analysis and commentary on nature.com. We are committed to developing the next generation of scientists through our backing for the Nature Awards for Mentoring in Science, the John Maddox Prize for Standing up for Science and the Nature Research Awards for Inspiring and Innovating Science.

Editorial policies
The Nature Portfolio journals' editorial policies for primary scientific research can be found on the pages listed below. The Nature Portfolio includes all journals with Nature in their name, the Communications journals, the npj series, Scientific Reports and Scientific Data. A list of these journals and a description of the relationship between them can be found

Nature
and the Nature research journals – now with immediate gold open access options for all primary research
We are fully committed to open research and the benefits this brings for researchers, institutions, funders and the wider public. For authors who wish to publish their research open access, the Nature Portfolio offers open access options for all primary research.
What is open access (OA)?
Why publish OA in the Nature Portfolio?
Options for OA at the Nature Portfolio
Transformative Journals
Funding for open access
Dedicated support for authors from lower income countries
What is open access (OA)?
Under the OA model, an article is made immediately available online when published, and is free to read for anyone in the world, rather than only to subscribing readers or institutions. The article is made available under a Creative Commons license, which allows for anyone to reuse or share the work according to the licence terms.
In our fully OA journals (such as
Nature Communications
and
Scientific Reports
), all articles are made OA on publication. In a hybrid or transformative Journal (including
Nature
and the Nature research journals), authors can choose between gold OA or subscription publication, based on their preferences, funder or institutional requirements for OA, and the availability of APC funding.
Payment for publication is typically made by the authors’ institutions or funding bodies, who pay an Article Processing Charge (APC) when the research is accepted. APCs vary from title to title, starting from €2,290 in
Scientific Reports
to €10,290 in
Nature
.
Why publish OA in the Nature Portfolio?
Open approaches accelerate the progress of science.
OA is immediately accessible and highly discoverable: anyone, anywhere can read, reuse and build on your work.
Previous research shows the OA advantage for researchers: OA articles are cited on average 1.6 times more than non-OA articles, downloaded 4 times more often and attract 2.5 times more attention, as measured by news and policy mentions.
1
Editorial rigour, with even greater reach: our OA options build on the foundations of our strong in-house editorial expertise. OA articles follow the same stringent standards.
Funder compliance: many funders and institutions now require articles to be published OA as part of the conditions of funding. We are enabling OA options for all primary research to enable our authors to meet these requirements, this includes Plan S.
Options for OA at the Nature Portfolio
At Springer Nature, we have been innovating in open research for two decades. At the Nature Portfolio that includes:
Launching
Scientific Reports
in 2011: home for all original research from across the natural and clinical sciences, engineering and psychology. Now the 5th most-cited journal in the world, it attracted over 734,000 citations in 2023 and receives widespread attention in policy documents and the media.
Through
Nature Communications
, creating the first Nature OA journal, publishing papers that significantly advance the natural sciences. Since becoming fully OA in 2014, it is the most cited multidisciplinary open science journal in the world.
Ensuring deposition of data and code alongside the research article to maximise transparency and reuse. Our active encouragement of data deposition has boosted data availability associated with published papers from around 50% to over 80% in some disciplines.
Encouraging authors to submit protocols to the Protocols Exchange  – an open sharing platform – providing valuable detailed reporting on the analytical and experimental design as well as statistical analyses.
Offering transparent peer review, publishing peer reviewer comments alongside the paper should the authors wish to do so.
Developing new OA journals to support the growing need for rigorous OA journals, including the
Nature Partner Journals
in collaboration with preeminent scientists, and our
Communications journal series
.
Transformative Journals
From January 2021, authors submitting to
Nature
and the Nature research journals could begin choosing to publish their primary research using either the traditional publishing route or immediate gold OA with an APC of €10,290. These journals make an active commitment to open research, by increasing the number of articles we publish each year OA, with the eventual goal of becoming fully OA. A journal that commits to this process is known as a
Transformative Journal (TJ)
. This will enable our authors to comply with funding requirements, including Plan S.
Find out more about Transformative Journals
Nature
and the Nature research journals are the first highly selective journals to offer their authors an immediate OA publishing option in this way. With more than 280 professional in-house Editors, more than 50,000 submissions each year, and an acceptance rate of less than 10%, the exceptional research in these journals has a profound effect on the disciplines to which it relates and the wider world. Research published in
Nature
and the Nature research journals is cited on average around 12 times more and downloaded by institutional users around 34 times more than papers in a typical journal.
Find out more about the Nature research journals
Dedicated support for authors from lower income countries
A dedicated fund has been made available to enable authors from many lower income countries (currently those classified by the World Bank as low-income (LIC) or lower-middle-income economies (LMICs)) to publish their primary research OA in Nature and the Nature research journals.
It is a specific provision to support a subset of authors and only applies to our highly selective Nature Portfolio hybrid or transformative journals as they transition to OA and will be reviewed at the end of 2024.
This applies to the following titles:
Nature; Nature Aging; Nature Astronomy; Nature Biomedical Engineering; Nature Biotechnology; Nature Cancer; Nature Cardiovascular Research; Nature Catalysis; Nature Cell Biology; Nature Chemical Biology; Nature Chemistry; Nature Climate Change; Nature Computational Science; Nature Ecology & Evolution; Nature Electronics; Nature Energy; Nature Food; Nature Genetics; Nature Geoscience; Nature Human Behaviour; Nature Immunology; Nature Machine Intelligence; Nature Materials; Nature Medicine;  Nature Mental Health; Nature Metabolism; Nature Methods; Nature Microbiology; Nature Nanotechnology; Nature Neuroscience; Nature Photonics; Nature Physics; Nature Plants; Nature Structural & Molecular Biology; Nature Sustainability; Nature Synthesis and Nature Water; Nature Chemical Engineering and Nature Cities
.
*It does not cover Nature Communications and Scientific Reports.
Please see our
journal pricing FAQs
for more details. As part of this initiative, authors will not need to ask to benefit from the support.
Corresponding authors
from qualifying countries whose primary research papers are accepted in principle (AIP) for publication in these titles will be informed as part of the publishing process that their paper will be published gold OA at no cost. Authors can opt out if they do not wish their papers to be published OA.

Information for authors
Publishing your article open access (OA) can bring you several benefits, including increased downloads and citations—and make your research more accessible to readers globally.
To help you take advantage of these benefits, many institutions cover researchers’ OA publishing costs (known as article processing charges, or APCs) as part of OA agreements with Springer Nature.
Upcoming author webinars
Paying for OA APCs through your institution
Publishing your article through an OA agreement is the easiest route to OA for eligible authors
Financial support for APCs
Many institutions offer financial support for researchers to pay APCs. One way is through OA agreements with publishers—either on their own or through a consortium agreement across many institutions.
Your institution’s OA agreement with Springer Nature may provide:
Full APC coverage - 100% of the APC is paid by the institution
A percentage discount - e.g. 10% off the list price APC
Fixed price coverage - e.g. up to €1,000 paid by the institution.
Different OA agreements include different journals
Institutions take different approaches to how they support their researchers publishing in different journals. Your institution’s agreement with Springer Nature may include journals from across Springer, Nature, BMC, Palgrave, and/or Adis.
Seamlessly integrated in the publishing workflow
Getting your APC paid via an OA agreement is seamlessly integrated into the Springer Nature publishing workflows and led by you, the corresponding author. Your article will be identified as part of an agreement based on details submitted. After your article has been accepted for publication, you will be notified of your coverage options and prompted to confirm your OA licensing on behalf of all co-authors.
Explore the steps in detail

We will only use the personal data gathered over this website as set out in this policy. Below you will find information on how we use your personal data, for which purposes your personal data is used, with whom it is shared and what control and information rights you may have.
I. Summary of our processing activities
We publish scholarly journals, books, news and data. Some of this material is freely available; some of it is only available to subscribers. The following summary offers a quick overview of the data processing activities that are undertaken on our website. You will find more detailed information under the indicated sections below.
When you visit our website for informational reasons without setting up an account, only limited personal data will be processed to provide you with the website itself (see III).
If you are identified as belonging to a customer organisation then we collect information in order to be able to provide usage reporting to that customer.
In case you register for one of our services, use the submission and peer review systems or subscribe to our newsletters, further personal data will be processed in the scope of such services (see IV and V).
Furthermore, your personal data will be used to provide you with relevant advertising for our services and products (see VII) and for statistical analysis that helps us to improve our website (see VIII). Additionally, we improve your website experience with third party content (see IX).
Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties (see X) that might be located outside your country of residence; potentially, different data protection standards may apply (see XI).
We have implemented appropriate safeguards to secure your personal data (see XII) and retain your personal data only as long as necessary (see XIII).
Under the legislation applicable to you, you may be entitled to exercise certain rights with regard to the processing of your personal data (see XIV).

Personal data
: means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier.
Processing
: means any operation which is performed on personal data, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or any kind of disclosure or other use.
III. Informational use of the website
When you visit our website for informational reasons, i.e. without registering for any of our provided services listed under IV and without providing us with personal data in any other form, we may automatically collect additional information about you which will contain personal data only in limited cases and which is automatically recognised by our server, such as:
Examples might include:
- your IP address;
- your device type, name and IDs;
- the date and time of your requests;
- the content of your requests;
- information on your browser version;
- your screen resolution;
- information on your operating system, including language settings.
We use such information only to assist us in providing an effective service (e.g. to adapt our website to the needs of your device or to allow you to log in to our website), and to collect broad demographic information for anonymised, aggregated use.
If you are identified by IP or equivalent method as belonging to a customer organisation such as university or a company then we will also collect the identity of that organisation and use it to create usage reports which show the organisation how much of the content we publish is being read by their students, members or employees. This information does not contain anything related to a personal login unless (a) you are a nominated administrator for that organisation or (b) your organisation specifically requires it as a part of a usage-based access contract.
The personal data automatically collected is necessary for us to provide the website, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR, and for our legitimate interest to guarantee the website’s stability and security, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR.
IV. Registration for our services
Access to subscription content is provided via a variety of mechanisms such as IP site licenses, login via third party federated identity providers or by a personal account with us. Using the federated authentication method institutional selection data may be stored locally in your browser and shared with third party websites that you visit to ease the process of institutional authentication. If your access to our content is provided by an organisation or an institution like a university or a company then they choose the access method on your behalf. A personal account is required to purchase content directly from us, or to receive personal services like newsletters and alerts.
If you need to create a personal login with us then we will store and process the following:
- Information (such as your name, user name and email address) that is provided by registration;
- Information in connection with an account sign-in facility (e.g. log-in and password details);
- Communications sent by you (e.g. via e-mail or website communication forms)

a) Facebook Social Plugins
We use so-called social plugins („plugins“) of the social networking site facebook.com, a service of Meta Platforms Inc, 1 Hacker Way Menlo Park, California 94025, USA (“Meta”). The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white “f” on blue tile or a “thumps-up”-sign) or by the additional text “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via:
http://developers.facebook.com/plugins
.
If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser.
Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user’s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany.
The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under:
http://www.facebook.com/policy.php
.
If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via this homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from Facebook before going to this homepage.
The user may also block Facebook’s plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example the “Facebook Blocker“.
b) Twitter
We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. (“Twitter”) The buttons are marked using the text “Twitter” or “Follow” and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to share an article or a website of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.
If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user’s browser directly connects to Twitter’s servers. The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitter’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser. According to the provider’s knowledge, Twitter collects the user IP-address and the website’s URL when the button is loaded from Twitter’s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and displaying the Twitter-button.
Further information can be found in Twitter’s privacy statement under:

For journals that operate an open or transparent peer review model for all submitted manuscripts, the reviewer reports (but not reviewer identities) are also passed to Research Square. For these titles only the reviewer reports are posted in the private author dashboard and never publicly.
Research Square uses this data to populate the peer review timeline in the private author dashboard, and surface free and paid for services that are appropriate to the author depending on where their manuscript is within the peer-review process. If authors have opted in for the

In support of the advancement of diversity, inclusion and equity (DEI) in research we may ask you to provide information related to gender and ethnicity, for example. This personal information will in no way be used when evaluating and handling your current or future submissions to Springer Nature; this data will be aggregated and anonymised before being analysed and reported in order to improve our policies and processes. More details on the Springer Nature DEI program

Within the scope of our information sharing activities set out above, your personal data may be transferred to other countries (including countries outside the EEA) which may have different data protection standards from your country of residence. Please note that data processed in a foreign country may be subject to foreign laws and accessible to foreign governments, courts, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies. However, we will endeavour to take reasonable measures to maintain an adequate level of data protection when sharing your personal data with such countries.
In the case of a transfer outside of the EEA, this transfer is  safeguarded by EU Model Clauses in accordance with Article 46 GDPR. You can find further information about the aforementioned safeguards by following this link
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en
or contact our Group Data Protection Officer via

XII. Security
We have reasonable state of the art security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal data under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal data. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.
You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via our website whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.

5. take legal actions in relation to any potential breach of your rights regarding the processing of your personal data, as well as to lodge complaints before the competent data protection regulators;
6. require (i) to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and (ii) to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from our side; where technically feasible you shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from us to another controller; and/or
7. not to be subject to any automated decision making, including profiling (automatic decisions based on data processing by automatic means, for the purpose of assessing several personal aspects) which produce legal effects on you or affects you with similar significance.
You may (i) exercise the rights referred to above or (ii) pose any questions or (iii) make any complaints regarding our data processing by contacting us using the contact details set out below.

Cookie Policy
The website uses cookies. You can deactivate or block cookies either by changing the settings within our Privacy Preference Centre or within your Browser.

Additionally you can then remove the cookies from your machine using the methods described below.
About cookies
Cookies are files, often including unique identifiers, that are sent by web servers to web browsers, and which may then be sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website.
Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
Cookies on the website
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on the website.
How we use cookies

Prerequisites for registering a User Account and registration process
User must be of age and have full legal capacity.
User must provide accurate and complete details upon registration and must keep them up to date.
User must provide a valid email address. User warrants that they are entitled to receive email at such email address. Springer Nature is not obliged to use such email address for communication with User.
User may review the data entered and correct any errors or terminate the registration process at any time before sending off the completed registration form. By clicking the confirmation button, User registers a User Account. Springer Nature will send User a confirmation of receipt of their registration. Springer Nature may reject registrations for any or no reason. The contract on using the user account will not be filed and will not be accessible to User.
Individual User Account and Institutional User Account
If User wants to order Products as an Individual Customer as well as on behalf of an Institutional Customer (section A.1.6), User must register
two separate User Accounts
for those different purposes, i.e.
one User Account for placing orders as an Individual Customer (
“Individual User Account”
) and
another User Account for placing orders on behalf of the relevant Institutional Customer (
“Institutional User Account”
).
User may, however, always register only one Individual User Account and only one Institutional User Account.
User must use a private email address for their Individual User Account and their professional email address (provided by the relevant Institutional Customer) for their Institutional User Account.
Upon registering an Institutional Account, User warrants and represents that they are duly authorized by the relevant Institutional Customer to act as its agent and conclude contracts in the name of that Institutional Customer.
Using the User Account
User’s role when using their User Account(s)
When using their Individual User Account, User shall always be deemed to act in their own name; when using their Institutional User Account, User shall always be deemed to act on behalf of the relevant Institutional Customer. This means:
If User orders Products as an
Individual Customer, User
shall be the
Customer
(as defined in clause A.1.6) and the
Authorized User
(as defined in A.1.7).
If User orders Products on behalf of the relevant
Institutional Customer
, that
Institutional Customer
shall be the
Customer
(as defined in clause A.1.6), but
User
shall be the (only)
Authorized User
(as defined in clause A.1.7).
Strictly personal use
A User Account is always User’s personal account. It provides User with access to the Digital Content and/or Services which they are authorized to use as the Authorized User (section A.4.1) according to the User’s rights of use for Digital Content (section B.2.7) and/or the specific terms for the relevant Service. This means:
User may not let other persons (including other persons affiliated with the same Institutional Customer) use their User Account and/or any Digital Content and/or Services which can be accessed from their User Account.
User may not give other persons access to downloaded Digital Content or share downloaded Digital Content with other persons in any form.
User may not give other persons access to any results created using a Service or share such results unless expressly authorized to do so under the applicable terms of the relevant Service (clause A.1.1).
User’s obligations and consequences of noncompliance
User must keep their user credentials confidential. If User has reason to suspect that another person may have access to, or be using, their User Account, User must inform Springer Nature immediately and set a new password.
Where User is responsible for third-party use of their User Account due to noncompliance with said obligations, User shall be liable for all consequences, including payment for orders.
Springer Nature may suspend or terminate a User Account after a warning or immediately in order to prevent misuse. In such event, User may not re-register without Springer Nature’s prior written consent. The suspension or termination of the User Account shall not affect Springer Nature’s right to continue to use User content already submitted by User.
Ordering products
User may put any Product in the shopping cart by clicking the relevant button on the Product page. User can review the content of the shopping cart at any time and may alter the number of copies (for goods only) or remove Products from the shopping cart or terminate the order process before submitting their order.
By clicking the confirmation button, User submits their order. Springer Nature will send User a confirmation of receipt; subject to clause A.5.3 the contract is concluded upon such confirmation. The contract will not be filed and will not be accessible to User, but Springer Nature will include the Terms and Conditions in the confirmation email.
Should the payment process not be completed successfully, i.e. Springer Nature does not receive a confirmation of Customer’s payment from the relevant payment service provider, Springer Nature will not confirm the order, but notify Customer of the failure of payment, and no contract will be deemed made.
Right of withdrawal for Individual Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia
An Individual Customer who has their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia and is acting for purposes which are outside their trade, business, craft or profession (“consumer”), has a statutory right of withdrawal. The conditions for and effects of withdrawal depend on the nature of the Product (section A.2).
There is no right of withdrawal for the following types of contracts:
the supply of sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software which were unsealed after delivery;
the supply of a newspaper, periodical or magazine with the exception of subscription contracts for the supply of such publications (i.e. the purchase of an individual issue);
the supply of Digital Content if the performance has begun with Customer’s prior express consent and Customer’s acknowledgment that Customer thereby loses their right of withdrawal and Springer Nature has sent Customer a confirmation of the contract and said consent and acknowledgement via email;
contracts of Services after the Service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with Customer’s prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that Customer will lose their right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed by Springer Nature.

Goods are delivered subject to retention of title and shall remain Springer Nature’s property until the purchase price has been paid in full.
Termination of the User Account, Subscriptions and contracts on Services
User may give notice of termination of the User Account at any time.
After termination, User shall no longer have any access to the Online Shop and, if applicable, to Digital Content Platforms, and will lose access any Digital Content. Unused amounts under on-going Subscriptions shall not be refunded.
Any provisions on the term of the User Account and on Rentals, Subscriptions and Services shall not affect the right of either party to terminate a contract for cause with immediate effect.
Notice of termination by Customer
Any notice of termination must be in in writing.
For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies:
“In writing” means “text form” (as defined in section 126b of The German Civil Code), i.e. on a “durable medium” (including fax and email) and specifying the sender (see clause A.1.3 for Springer Nature’s contact details).
Springer Nature’s Liability
For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies:
For Goods and Digital Products there is a legal guarantee of conformity. Claims arising from that guarantee become statute-barred within two years after the goods have been received or the Digital Product was provided, in the case of the continuous provision of a Digital Product not earlier than 12 months after the end of the provision of the Digital Product.
Springer Nature’s liability shall not be limited in any event for any loss or damage which is (a) due to intent or gross negligence; (b) for loss of life, limb, or health. Strict liability under the German Product Liability Act shall not be limited.
If an essential contractual obligation (i.e. an obligation the performance of which is necessary for due implementation of the contract, the performance of which a contractual partner generally may rely on, and the breach of which jeopardizes the attainment of the purpose of the contract) was breached due to slight negligence, Springer Nature’s liability shall be limited to that loss or damage the occurrence of which is typical with regard to the nature of the contract and was foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract.
In all other cases, Springer Nature shall not be liable, for whatever cause in law.
For Customers having their habitual residence in North, Central or South America, the following applies:
Springer Nature warrants that it has the right to grant Customer the rights granted in these Terms and Conditions. Except for foregoing express warranty and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Springer Nature provides all Goods, Digital Content and Subscriptions (the “Content”) “as is” and makes no other representation or warranty. Springer Nature expressly disclaims any liability for any claim arising from or out of the Content, including but not limited to any errors, inaccuracies, omissions, or defects contained therein, and any implied or express warranty as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Springer Nature shall not be liable for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Springer Nature’s liability for any and all claims under this agreement is limited to the agreed amounts actually paid by the customer at the time of the relevant purchase.
Customer is obliged to make regular complete backups of data produced or stored by Customer at reasonable intervals that reflect the value of such data. Springer Nature shall not be liable for any loss of such data which could have been avoided by Customer’s compliance with said obligation.
Application of the Terms and Conditions, amendments
The contract on the use of the User Account and all contracts concluded in the Online Shop shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions as well as any other terms and conditions or other legal terms applicable to websites on which Customer has created the User Account. Should Customer have its own terms of business, such terms shall only apply where Springer Nature has expressly agreed to them in writing prior to conclusion of the relevant contract.
Springer Nature may amend these Terms and Conditions if Springer Nature deems the amendment necessary to adapt these Terms and Conditions to changes in statutory law or case-law or to technical developments, or due to the introduction of new products or features of products. Springer Nature will notify the User/Customer of its intent to amend the Terms and Conditions and the envisaged date of the amended Terms and Conditions entering into force. If User/Customer does not object to the amendment within one month after receipt of said notification (the “Objection Period”), User/Customer shall be deemed to have agreed to the amended Terms and Conditions. In said notification, Springer Nature shall point out the legal relevance of the Objection Period.
Should User/Customer object to the amendment, Springer Nature may give notice of termination of the relevant contract(s) at the time when the amended Terms and Conditions come into force; in such event Springer Nature shall without undue delay reimburse on a pro rata basis any advance payments of subscription fees.
Severability
Should any provision of these Terms and Conditions be or become ineffective or unenforceable, this shall not affect the remainder of these Terms and Conditions. In any such case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for a clause which is to substitute the ineffective/unenforceable provision, reasonably balancing the parties’ interests.
Governing law and venue
For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies:
Contracts between User/Customer and Springer Nature shall be governed and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with German law, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). If User/Customer is a natural person who concluded a contract for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside their trade or profession, this shall not have the result of depriving the User/Customer of the protection afforded to them by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law of the country where the User/Consumer has their habitual residence.
The parties agree that they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Heidelberg, Germany for all legal disputes arising directly or indirectly from the contractual relationship between Springer Nature and the User/Customer in the following circumstances:
User/Customer is a registered trader according to the German Commercial Code, a public corporation or a special trust managing public assets;
User’s/Customer’s place of residence or habitual place of abode is outside Germany or User/Customer relocated their place of residence or habitual place of abode outside Germany after the conclusion of the contract;
User’s/Customer’s place of residence or habitual place of abode is not known at the time when legal action is filed.
For Customers having their habitual residence in North, Central or South America, the following applies:
Contracts between User/Customer and Springer Nature shall be governed and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
The parties agree that they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in New York, NY, USA.
Out-of-court settlements/jury trial
We do not engage in out-of-court settlements before consumer arbitration bodies. However, we are obliged to inform you that the European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution, which is available at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
For Customers having their habitual residence in North America, Central America or South America, the following applies: User/Customer expressly waives the right to a trial by jury.
Special provisions for specific products
Purchase of Goods
Springer Nature shall deliver Goods within the time specified at the time the order is placed.
Springer Nature shall deliver Goods using an appropriate shipping method chosen in its reasonable discretion; shipping costs shall never exceed the amount specified specified at the time the order is placed.
Springer Nature may make partial deliveries where Customer can be reasonably expected to accept partial delivery; this will never result in higher shipping costs to be borne by Customer.

Rights of Use for Digital Content

Guided Open Access
Guided Open Access (“Guided OA”) is a programme that enables you to submit your Article to one Nature Research journal, and be considered simultaneously by two other associated journals in the Nature Portfolio. See our
Guided OA page
for further details on the Guided OA programme.
a.Initial Submission
In order to participate in the Guided OA programme, you must select the Guided OA option when submitting your Article to a participating Nature Research Journal, and provide all information required pursuant to the submission process. If your Article is deemed appropriate for the Guided OA programme, it will be assigned to a handling editor from one of the participating journals, and you will be asked to arrange payment of an Editorial Assessment Charge (see Charges, below). If your Article is determined not to be suitable for any of the journals in the Guided OA programme, you will be notified and no Editorial Assessment Charge will be payable.
b.Editorial Assessment Report
Once your article has been assigned to a handling  editor and you have provided billing details for the Editorial Assessment Charge, your Article will be sent for peer review in accordance with our standard practices. On the basis of their expert judgement, and the feedback from one round of peer review, the Nature Portfolio editor responsible for your Article will prepare an Editorial Assessment Report (EAR). The EAR will typically provide an editorial evaluation of the manuscript, an open research evaluation, guidance for adhering to best reproducibility practice, and help to navigate and interpret the reviewers’ feedback, but contents of individual EARs may vary. If your Article is provisionally recommended for publication after the first round of peer review, the EAR will recommend which journal(s) will be suitable for publication of your Article. If you choose to continue with a recommended journal, the peer review process will continue in accordance with the journal’s standard practice. However, you are under no obligation to continue with a recommended journal, and may use the EAR in connection with preparation for submission of your Article to another journal.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN GUIDED OA (1) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR ARTICLE WILL BE PEER REVIEWED AT THE JOURNAL OF YOUR CHOICE, AND (2) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR ARTICLE IN ANY PARTICULAR PARTICIPATING JOURNAL, OR IN ANY OF THE PARTICIPATING JOURNALS.  SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE REVIEWED AND PUBLISHING DECISIONS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGH STANDARDS OF NATURE PORTFOLIO JOURNALS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF A MANUSCRIPT FOR PUBLICATION IN PARTICIPATING JOURNALS UNDER THE GUIDED OA PROGRAMME WILL BE NO GREATER THAN FOR MANUSCRIPTS SUBMITTED TO SUCH JOURNALS UNDER STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION OR OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING TERMS.
c. Publication
Articles published through the Guided OA Programme will be published under a open access under a CC BY-NC-ND (Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International licence) or CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence) licence.
• CC BY-NC-ND: The article can be shared for non-commercial purposes as long as the authors are credited. Permission is needed for commercial re-use or sharing adapted and derivative versions.
• CC BY: The article may be shared and adapted for any purpose, including commercially, so long as the authors are credited. To learn more about OA licences visit our
licensing and copyright guide
.
2.
Eligibility
If you are affiliated with an institution participating in a Fully OA agreement or Transformative (or Compact) agreement that includes Nature Portfolio journals, you will not be eligible for Guided Open Access, where fees are applied before acceptance (Editorial Assessment Charge). Direct Open Access is available to you by selecting the open access option once your paper has been accepted, with your fees covered by the relevant institutional agreement. Please check our
OA agreement pages
for further information about what fees are covered.
3.
Charges
Once your Article has entered the Guided Open Access process, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Editorial Assessment Charge (EAC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the EAC.
THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT CHARGE WILL NOT BE REFUNDED EVEN IF YOUR ARTICLE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN ONE OF THE GUIDED OA JOURNALS PURSUANT TO THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT OR IS OTHERWISE NOT PUBLISHED IN A GUIDED OA JOURNAL FOR ANY REASON.
If your article is accepted for publication after completion of the peer review process at a recommended journal, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Top-Up Article Processing Charge (APC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the Top-Up APC.
If your Article is published in a Nature Research journal (Nature Physics, Nature Methods or Nature Genetics), the combined amount of the EAC and the Top-Up APC will be lower than the cost of publishing on an open access basis directly through those journals, outside of Guided OA.
IF YOUR ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS OR ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS JOURNALS, THE COMBINED AMOUNT OF THE EAC AND THE TOP-UP APC WILL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE COST OF PUBLISHING ON AN OPEN ACCESS BASIS DIRECTLY WITH ANY OF SUCH JOURNALS, OUTSIDE OF GUIDED OA.
Please see the Nature Research
Guided Open Access page
for exact costs.
4.
Right of Withdrawal
You have the right to withdraw from your agreement to pay the EAC or Top-Up APC within 14 days without giving any reason.
The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.
To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (for customers domiciled or established in North, Central or South America: Springer Nature Customer Service Center LLC, 200 Hudson Street, Suite 503, Jersey City, NJ 07311, USA, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email:

We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

7.
