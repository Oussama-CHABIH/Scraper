Cognitive computing is the creation of self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to solve complicated problems without constant human oversight. It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.
The goal of the
International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering
is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making.
Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.

Mission and objectives
​​
We believe in the global impact of research from China
​
At KeAi, our mission is to unfold quality research globally, combining cutting-edge technologies and data insights with a personal approach to everyone we serve and everything we do.
We have three key objectives, which lie at the heart of all our core activities:
To build on traditional and long-established publishing principles
​
KeAi benefits from a
long and illustrious history
. Our founders are Elsevier, the world’s leading scientific information and analytics company, and China Science Publishing & Media Ltd (CSPM), China’s leading academic publisher – together they bring nearly
200 years of knowledge and expertise
to the relationship. While drawing on their experience, we always have one eye firmly on the future and never stop exploring opportunities to make a difference.
To enhance global visibility and access to scientific research
Our
Chinese roots
are important to us, as is optimising the
global reach and impact
of the articles we publish. That’s why all our journals provide a
rigorous peer review process
and authors can rest easy in the knowledge that each submission is handled by
renowned editors
and
expert editorial and publishing teams
. We also draw on the latest publishing technology, along with
innovative new tools
, to expand research accessibility to all; for example, all our journals are published fully open access on ScienceDirect, so everything is free to read, download, and share.
To publish world-class academic journals
Our goal is to develop
top-tier journals
that aid the advancement and application of scientific research. Our commitment to
continuous improvement and quality
means many of our journals go on to be indexed by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Science Citation Index, Scopus and other leading databases, and receive Impact Factors and CiteScores. More recently, a number of journals were also selected for inclusion in the
Chinese Action Plan for Excellence
.

Cognitive computing is the creation of self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to solve complicated problems without constant human oversight. It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.
The goal of the
International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering
is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making.
Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.

Open access
Editor-in-Chief

Editorial Board

Cognitive computing is the creation of self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to solve complicated problems without constant human oversight. It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.
The goal of the
International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering
is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making.
Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.

Cognitive computing is the creation of self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to solve complicated problems without constant human oversight. It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.
The goal of the
International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering
is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making.
Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.

Cognitive computing is the creation of self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to solve complicated problems without constant human oversight. It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.
The goal of the
International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering
is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making.
Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.

Benefits of publishing with KeAi
Benefits of publishing with KeAi
Open access
​All KeAi journals are
open access (OA)
, making it easy to comply with the rising number of government, funder and institution OA requirements. When you publish OA, your article is immediately, permanently, and freely available for anyone to access, read, and build upon. And research suggests that OA articles reach a more varied audience than subscription articles, meaning your work may be read by educators, policy makers and the general public too. Our journals never charge article submission fees. In some cases, however, an article publishing charge (APC) may be applied to accepted manuscripts. APC information can be found on the homepages of relevant journals.
​High visibility
Your published article will be hosted on the world’s biggest publishing platform,
ScienceDirect
, which has more than 17 million unique visitors each month. Your work will also be indexed and shared as widely as possible –  our OA journals feature in key databases such as Scopus, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Web of Science and PubMed Central.
Top quality
Our commitment to continuous improvement and quality means that many of our journals go on to be indexed by leading databases in their field, and receive Impact Factors and CiteScores. More recently, a number of journals were also selected for inclusion in the Chinese Action Plan for Excellence.
Strong community links
While our mission is to unfold quality research globally, we remain a Chinese company with roots firmly embedded in the communities we serve. Thanks to that close relationship, we understand what matters to those we work with and can respond swiftly when needs change. Our reputation for agility and a personal touch has helped us build partnerships with a range of prestigious societies and academic institutions.
A history you can trust
Our founders are Elsevier, the world’s leading scientific information and analytics company, and China Science Publishing & Media Ltd (CSPM), China’s leading academic publisher – together, they bring nearly 200 years of knowledge and expertise to the relationship.
Article innovation
ScienceDirect draws on the latest technology to provide visitors to your article with an optimal reading experience. Enhancements offered by the PDF reader include inline author and reference links with abstract preview, citing articles and recommended articles.
Author rights
Authors retain a range of
author rights
and we offer a liberal copyright policy. We also ensure copyright and legal information is protected.

Peer review process
Peer review is crucial to the publishing process, it validates an author’s research to confirm its suitability for publication.
Becoming a reviewer
Most reviewers are invited to conduct a review by a journal editor, who will select researchers from the same discipline to review and validate a paper. If you think you might be a suitable reviewer for a specific journal, you could contact the journal editor.

Publishing ethics
Even when scientific misconduct is unintentional, breaking the publishing ethics rules can badly damage your reputation as a researcher. As an author, it is your responsibility to ensure that you publish ethically and maintain the standards of academic publishing.
Elsevier’s Researcher Academy
offers expert ethics advice and guidance, including training, webcasts, videos and interviews.
Ethics toolkit factsheets
Elsevier has also developed a number of Ethics Factsheets designed to help you navigate potential ethics pitfalls. Topics covered include:
Duplicate submission
. This occurs when an author submits a paper to different publications at the same time. As a result, the paper may appear in multiple journals.
Research fraud
. Falls into two broad categories: 1) Fabrication - making up research data and results and recording or reporting them, and 2) Falsification - manipulating research materials, images, data, equipment, or processes.
Plagiarism
. One of the most common types of publication misconduct, it occurs when an author deliberately uses another’s work without permission, credit, or acknowledgment.|
Authorship
. The term ‘author’ is generally agreed to describe someone who has made a significant intellectual contribution to the study. Deliberately excluding an author, or adding someone who does not meet the criteria, is considered a form of misconduct.
Conflict of interests
. As an article author, it is essential to be transparent about competing commitments, interests or loyalties.
Salami slicing
. This term describes the ‘slicing’ of research that would form one meaningful paper into several different papers.

Cognitive computing is the creation of self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to solve complicated problems without constant human oversight. It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.
The goal of the
International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering
is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making.
Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.

Publishing roles
Editor/Co-Editors
Together with the publisher, editors are responsible for forming the scope and policies of a journal and ensuring the content published reflects important work in the research field. They will select papers they deem to be high enough quality, and fit with the scope of the journal for peer review.
Editors are generally appointed by the publisher or society for society-owned journals.
Editorial/Advisory Boards
Editorial boards are made up of experts appointed by the editor from within the journal's field. Individuals may be on several journals’ editorial boards. Their role may include:
Reviewing papers
Advising on journal aims and scope
Attracting new paper submissions
Submitting some of their own papers
Putting forward special issues topics
Guest Editors
Guest editors will act as editors for a special issue, supplement or Procedia.
Guest editors play a vital role in curating high-quality contributions on a particular topic and driving the editorial review process for special issue publications.
As guest editor, you are responsible for the following actions:
Preparing a proposal for a special issue
Inviting submissions to this special issue
All submissions should be submitted via an
online submission and review system indicated on the journal homepage
. The submission and peer review of special issue papers must be managed using this system. In addition to reading the material contained below, you should also familiarize yourself with any journal-specific guidelines which will be available on the journal
’s homepage.
Selection of papers and decision process
You are responsible, in cooperation with any other guest editor(s) for the special issue, for ensuring that the review process is conducted in an appropriate manner and in line with normal review practices for the journal. You shall consult with the Editor-in-Chief about the refereeing procedure to be adopted.
This selection of papers should be based on the scientific quality of the content and the topic should clearly fall within the scope of the special issue and the journal hosting it.
You will typically make the preliminary decision on all manuscripts based on reviews but all manuscripts (and revisions) will then be transferred to the Editor-in-Chief who normally has the sole right to review and/or reject any manuscript(s) or arrange for any manuscript(s) to be independently peer reviewed prior to final acceptance for publication.
Selection of reviewers
As guest editor, you should select reviewers who have suitable expertise in the field and must review all disclosures of potential conflicts of interest made by reviewers in order to determine whether there is any potential for bias.
Research articles must typically be reviewed by at least two external and independent reviewers, and where necessary you should seek additional opinions. The guest editor must follow best practice guidance provided by the Publisher on avoiding the selection of fraudulent peer reviewers.
You might find the information available on
Finding reviewers page
useful in this regard.
The guest editor must not be involved in decisions about papers in which s/he has written him/herself. Peer review of any such submission should be handled independently of the relevant guest editor/co-editor and their research groups.
Should you have any questions during your guest editorship, please direct these to the relevant contact through our
publishing team
.

Finding reviewers
It can be a challenge to find new reviewers, here are some tools and tips help:
Tools
Elsevier Editorial Manager (EM), used by KeAi, offers a
Scopus
search field to identify reviewers. Scopus helps to determine the suitability of a reviewer using their publication and citation record, as well as details of co-authors.
ScienceDirect offers access to full-text articles for reviewers to help them validate a review paper.
EM assists editors in building reviewer databases and helps with the reviewer invitation process, including setting up automatic secondary reviewer invitations should a reviewer not respond within a sufficient time.
Tips
Select reviewers conducting research in a similar area; they will be best placed to spot any shortcomings of the paper. Their interest in the topic may also mean they review the paper quicker.
Ask editorial board members to review.
Try not to use reviewers who have not published in the last five years.
Contact young professors, researchers, postdoctorates or emeritus professors; they can often be some of the best reviewers.
Ask recently published authors; they may be more likely to review.
Mid-career professionals, and those who have not published in the journal, may not review but could refer papers to another reviewer.
Only invite as many reviewers as you require.
