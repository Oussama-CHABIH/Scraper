Information about SCOAP

and
Physical Review
journals
SCOAP
3
— Open Access in High-Energy Physics
APS participates in
SCOAP
3
(Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics), an international coalition of more than 3,000 libraries and research institutions from over 45 participating countries.  Managed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (
CERN
), it funds open access publishing in high-energy physics research.
Under the SCOAP
3
model, high-energy physics papers posted to the
arXiv
and published in
Physical Review Letters
(PRL),
Physical Review C
(PRC), and
Physical Review D
(PRD) can be published open access, without any article publication charges (APCs) to authors.
APS has been participating in SCOAP
3
since Jan. 1, 2018 and the current arrangement extends to articles published through 2027.
How It Works
Post your high-energy physics (hep) paper to the arXiv with a primary category of hep-ex, hep-th, hep-ph, or hep-lat.*
Note arXiv moderators have the right to review and change categorization if it is deemed incorrect.
Submit your article to
PRL
,
PRC
, or
PRD
.
Provide your arXiv ID to APS during submission, or as soon as possible afterwards. It must be received before publication. Delays may occur if the arXiv ID is received after the article is accepted for publication.
APS will automatically check eligibility with the arXiv
Authors must agree to publish their article with a
CC-BY license
.
Articles will be published open access, without any cost to authors, and include the text ‘Funded by SCOAP3’.
SUBMIT YOUR ARTICLE
*Articles must be posted to the appropriate category. arXiv.org is a fully independent service and neither APS nor the SCOAP
3
collaboration can challenge the decision of arXiv moderators regarding a possible reclassification of an article.
Information for Subscribers
APS directly offsets revenue received for open access publishing from SCOAP
3
by reducing subscription fees for
PRL
,
PRC
, and
PRD
. Institutional, library consortia, and multi-site subscribers to APS online packages and participating journals will receive an offset reduction to the cost of their annual online subscription.
We encourage all subscribers to engage with the SCOAP
3
initiative and
participate in the funding model
. This will help ensure the long-term sustainability of equitable open access publishing in high-energy physics.
If you have any questions regarding your subscription please contact

FLASH: New intersection of physics, chemistry, biology, and cancer medicine
Treating cancer with ionizing radiation has been pursued for nearly a century. A key challenge has been finding the right balance between providing enough dose to kill the cancer cells while minimizing the damage to normal ones. The discovery of the so-called FLASH effect, where short radiation bursts allow for higher lethal doses to be delivered to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue, opens up the therapeutic window and ushers in a new era for radiation therapy. In this review multidisciplinary aspects are discussed of dose delivery, the chemistry and biology behind the effect, and readiness for clinical deployment.

Colloquium:
Eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators
The numerical treatment of quantum systems often requires large amounts of computing power and time. As a result, performing calculations repeatedly for different values of the input parameters is often not feasible. One remedy is using eigenvectors describing the system that are analytic functions that vary smoothly for real values of the input parameters. This allows one to replace computationally expensive calculations with emulators that project onto a reduced-basis set. This Colloquium explores a particular class of reduced-basis methods known as eigenvector continuation and its applications, with emphasis on nuclear physics.

Ultimate Rayleigh-Bénard turbulence
Rayleigh-Bénard convection is the flow in a closed box heated from below and cooled from above. The ultimate regime of Rayleigh-Bénard turbulence occurs when the dimensionless temperature difference between the bottom and top plates is large. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the theoretical approaches to the ultimate regime and of the experimental and numerical results on the transition to this regime. These are reconciled by realizing that the transition is of non-normal–nonlinear nature, as typical for the laminar to turbulent transition in shear flow. The review also suggests experimental and numerical approaches to further understand the transition to the ultimate regime.

Thermodynamics of the climate system
While the first law of thermodynamics is a well-established principle underlying all models of Earth’s climate system, applications of the second law in climate science are active areas of research. This review summarizes how the relationships between Earth’s entropy export and internal entropy production provide insights into Earth’s climate. These applications include heat-engine analogs for atmospheric convection, tropical cyclones, and large-scale atmospheric heat transport. Open issues addressed include the ongoing debate on whether the climate system maximizes entropy production.

Unitary collapse of Schrödinger’s cat state
The authors study a system composed of a single qubit coupled to a soft-mode quantum oscillator. They show that spontaneous unitary evolution of this system create a Schrödinger-cat-like state of the oscillator, which is subsequently lost in a sudden process strongly resembling the measurement-induced collapse of wave function.

EDITORS' SUGGESTION
Concatenated Steane code with single-flag syndrome checks
This paper examines a fault-tolerant error-correction protocol for a particular concatenated Steane code that requires only two ancilla qubits per generator. The authors enhance its performance by finding an appropriate gate ordering of the syndrome measurements that tolerates up to four faults. They run noise simulations at the circuit level to suggest that this code has a significantly higher noise threshold than a comparable color code, in contrast to what other noise models predict.

Limitations in fluorescence-detected entangled two-photon-absorption experiments: Exploring the low- to high-gain squeezing regimes
The authors present an experimental study of entangled two-photon absorption in solvated rhodamine 6G, providing strong evidence that the orders-of-magnitude increases in two-photon-absorption efficiency by using entangled light reported in previous studies cannot be explained by the community’s current understanding of the process. Thus, the sought-after advantages of using two-photon absorption of time-frequency-entangled photon pairs as a practical tool for enhancing molecular spectroscopy and biological imaging remains elusive.

Exactly solvable model of light-scattering errors in quantum simulations with metastable trapped-ion qubits
Metastable atomic levels have attracted recent attention for applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation, but scalable approaches to model their fundamental errors are needed. The authors addressed this by solving a master equation that describes light-scattering errors for these qubits, providing physical insights into the influence of these errors, as well as scalable formulas for modeling a variety of future experiments.

Angular momentum flow without anything carrying it
The authors theoretically demonstrate a flow of angular momentum from one region to another across a region of space in which there is a vanishingly small probability of any particles (or fields) being present. This is contrary to the usual understanding that conserved quantities, such as angular momentum, are carried from one region to another either by particles carrying them, or by particles interacting with one another in a chain.

EDITORS' SUGGESTION
Flexible entangled-state generation in linear optics
Entangled dual-rail photonic qubit states are important resource states for measurement-based and fusion-based quantum computing. However, their generation is highly challenging due to the probabilistic nature of entangling operations. Here, the authors introduce a formalism using ZX diagrams to design linear optical systems that can generate entangled multiqubit states of dual-rail photonic qubits. This formalism makes it easier to compare methods for creating a desired photonic state and to find the most optimal one.

Topological quantum phase transitions driven by a displacement field in twisted
MoTe
2
bilayers
The Chern bands in twisted MoTe
2
semiconductor bilayers host fascinating quantum effects, including the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) state at a zero magnetic field. This study explores the stability of 1/3 and 2/3 FQAH states under intermediate values of an externally applied out-of-plane electric displacement field, where the single-particle band topology remains unchanged. By demonstrating the nontrivial effects of electric fields on partially filled topological bands, the authors map a rich topological quantum phase diagram as a function of twist angles and displacement fields.

Principles of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy of collective excitations: The case of Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors
This paper presents a theoretical framework for two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) of collective excitations in condensed matter systems. Focusing on the Josephson plasma resonance in layered superconductors as a model collective excitation, the authors show how 2DTS reveals physics beyond what is accessible in the linear response. They also demonstrate that 2DTS spectra of collective modes can exhibit unique signatures that defy intuition from nuclear magnetic resonance, which may indicate, for example, the presence of dynamics beyond the mean-field approximation.

Scanning tunneling spectroscopy study of proximity superconductivity in finite-size quantized surface states
Normal metals can inherit superconducting pairing when they are proximity-coupled to a superconducting host material. Creating two-dimensional surface states with this pairing can lead to exotic phases of matter. However, their localized nature weakens direct coupling to the host material. This study explores how, despite weak intrinsic coupling – as evident by the observation of several Machida-Shibata-States in high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy – the surface states in Ag(111) and Cu(111) still achieve superconductivity through scattering from step edges and defects.

Unconventional superconductivity from electronic dipole fluctuations
The authors show that electric dipole fluctuations of Fermi-surface states are a possible source of unconventional superconductivity, especially in the presence of parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling as is the case for Dirac metals. For the latter, they find a leading state analogous to the
3
He-
B
phase and a competitive subleading
p
-wave state. They also show that the proposed pairing glue is directly measurable in the optical conductivity.

Piezomagnetism in the Ising ferromagnet URhGe
Piezomagnetism, deformation linear in magnetic fields, is an interesting response that is allowed only in materials, which break time-reversal symmetry. However, the most classical example of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, the ferromagnet, has never been known to exhibit piezomagnetism for more than half a century after the first prediction. Here, the authors found the overlooked piezomagnetism in the ferromagnet URhGe. They observed unconventional
V
-shaped field-induced deformation using optical-fiber-based strain-gauge technique. Unique monodomain switching of Ising-like magnetization in URhGe is key to this ferromagnetic piezomagnetism.

Weak-coupling theory of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
The discovery of exotic properties in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) established two-dimensional moiré structures as an exciting new platform for strongly correlated physics. The distinct features of MATBG include a fourfold spin-valley flavor degeneracy and two extraordinarily flat topologically fragile low-energy bands. Here, the authors seek to gain new insights into MATBG physics by applying RPA theory, which accounts for dynamic screening of long-range Coulomb interactions and establishes the crucial influence of correlations in compressible metallic states in expanding unbroken symmetry regions in the MATBG phase diagram.

Electronic excitations in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall states
Tunneling electrons into fractional quantum Hall states is a potential probe for the fractionalization process. Here, the authors explore this process using composite fermion theory. They demonstrate how the long-range interaction dresses and shapes the electron spectral function to evolve from gapped sharp peaks to a possibly gapped continuum as the filling factor approaches compressible values.

Bipartite Sachdev-Ye models with Read-Saleur symmetries
The authors introduce and analyze a novel example of a nonlocal model that violates the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis via Hilbert space fragmentation. This fragmentation manifests itself through the presence of a highly degenerate null space. The commutant algebra responsible for the fragmentation is a subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant of Temperley-Lieb models. The model studied resembles the Sachdev-Ye model, and its low-energy correlators are analyzed using similar techniques. Perturbations leading to quantum many-body scarring in the model are also considered.

The low-temperature behavior of the penetration depth of a superconductor can be used to infer properties of low-energy quasiparticles.

Sliding-dependent electronic structures of alternating-twist tetralayer graphene
Unlike twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), the electronic structures of alternating-twist tetralayer graphene (ATTG) vary with sliding between layers. Here, the authors model the system as two vertically stacked equal twist angle TBG layers. They specifically explore how three sliding geometries (AA, AB, and SP) affect its electronic and optical properties, including valley Chern numbers. The results of optical conductivity and self-consistent Hartree band structures provide deeper insights into ATTG with various sliding configurations and offer potential experimental fingerprints.

Revealing hidden medium-range order in silicate glass formers using many-body correlation functions
The medium-range order in amorphous systems is believed to be related to quantities like dynamic heterogeneity, glass-formation ability, or the elastic properties of the glass. So far, however, there has been no simple way to characterize this order. Here, the authors use a novel many-body correlation function that allows to characterize this order. Applying this approach to sodium silicate glasses reveals that in these systems the temperature and compositional dependence of the medium-range order is surprisingly complex.

Linear magnetoelectric electro-optical effect
Berry curvature and the magnetic moment of Bloch electrons in quantum materials yield unexpected electro-optical effects. Here, the authors derive a generalized constitutive relation for current response in electrically biased systems using semiclassical Boltzmann theory. They uncover a magnetoelectric electro-optical effect requiring broken time-reversal or inversion symmetry. This work reveals how Berry curvature and magnetic moment textures in Bloch bands can lead to unique electromagnetic signatures, potentially enabling new ways to manipulate light in quantum materials.

Terahertz and gigahertz magnetoratchets in graphene-based two-dimensional metamaterials
Here, the authors study the ratchet effect – the conversion of alternating fields in the terahertz and gigahertz range into direct current – using a 2D metamaterial formed by monolayer graphene and a nearby gate with an array of triangular holes. A combined experimental and theoretical study shows that application of magnetic field leads to giant enhancement of the ratchet current and emergence of quantum magneto-oscillations, also featuring a complex Fano shape of the cyclotron resonance and well-pronounced electron spin resonance.

Chiral Stoner magnetism in Dirac bands
Stoner magnetism in bands with Berry curvature features a coupling between spin chirality density and Berry’s orbital magnetism, arising without microscopic spin-orbital interactions. Carriers moving in a spin texture perceive it as a geometric magnetic field coupled to their orbital motion through a spin-dependent gauge field. This emergent spin-orbital interaction, previously predicted to enable chiral magnons at system boundaries, also favors chiral spin textures such as skyrmions – topologically protected, particle-like objects stabilized in the ground state.

Dynamics of dilute nuclear matter with light clusters and in-medium effects
The treatment of particle correlations and the description of clusters in the nuclear medium are important aspects that need to be better understood in the theoretical description of nuclear matter and the simulation of heavy-ion collisions. The authors propose a novel treatment of clustering for transport calculations based on a mechanism that suppresses cluster formation due to the Pauli principle via a medium-dependent cutoff in the momentum distribution of the clusters. The impact of clusters on the dynamics of unstable nuclear matter is clearly seen, and a `distillation’ mechanism is observed that affects the distribution of clusters between the low- and high-density regions. Although the approach has room for improvements, it captures the essential physics, and promises to have an impact on the further development of the field.

nuclei within chiral effective field theory
The nature of dark matter is one of the outstanding problems in particle physics and cosmology. To assist in the search for dark matter (DM), the authors examine the most general interactions between weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), assumed to be spin-1/2 fermions, and isotopes of the lightest nuclei, hydrogen and helium, using chiral effective field theory for a wide range of masses and coupling constants. The authors conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions are much greater than the others and severely constrained by the existing limits provided by experiments. The present study could be extended to other possible types of DM interactions, lighter DM candidates or heavier nuclei, such as lithium, argon, and xenon, currently widely used in dark matter detectors.

Examining the possibility that normal nuclear matter is quarkyonic
Lattice QCD calculations at finite temperature and zero or small baryon chemical potential have shown that there is no phase transition separating quasi-free quarks and those confined in baryons. Quarkyonic matter is a hypothetical state where quarks and baryons can coexist in a single Fermi sphere; quarks occupy the low momenta levels, hadrons the high momenta ones. This paper puts forward the idea that normal nuclear matter may, in fact, be quarkyonic and that the existence of this exotic phase may already have been seen in current electron-nucleus scattering data.

calculations of atomic nuclei have revolutionized nuclear structure physics. Yet challenges remain, not least the reliable calculation of nuclear radii. In a concurrent development, modern machine-learning algorithms have excelled in a variety of computational tasks such as pattern recognition and interpolation. The authors have applied artificial neural networks (ANNs) to the extrapolation of no-core shell model calculations to infinite model spaces, effectively circumventing their computational limitations. In particular, the results show that min-max normalization, a common technique in machine learning, leads to the best results for radii. These advances offer hope that the ANN architecture is capable of handling other observables such as electromagnetic moments and transition strengths.

process and the X17 boson
Recent observations by the ATOMKI Collaboration of anomalies in electron-positron pair production following proton capture on light nuclides has led to the postulation of a new boson with mass around 17 MeV. Here a team of scientists from the United States, Canada, and France presents the most detailed microscopic calculations to date of the proton capture reactions, and is unable to find a conventional explanation for the anomalies. While these calculations do not confirm the existence of the so-called X17 boson, they provide strong motivation for continued and independent experiments to investigate the ATOMKI results. Further refinements of the calculations may provide theoretical constraints for future data.

reaction
Nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang (BBN) can produce the lightest elements, including lithium, but the observed abundance of lithium in old stellar populations is much less than that predicted from BBN. To solve this so-called “lithium puzzle”, it had been postulated that a previously unobserved resonance in
7
Be could deplete lithium through resonant proton capture on
6
Li and thus account for the deficit. The authors performed a detailed study using information from all possible reactions that could be influenced by such a state, utilizing the stringent constraint imposed by the unitarity of the scattering matrix. They conclude that the postulated

COLLECTION
Subject Focus: Astrophysics
To mark the 243rd American Astronomical Society meeting,
Physical Review Letters
,
Physical Review C
, and
Physical Review D
highlighted several significant papers in astrophysics to illustrate the type of research these journals seek to publish.
EDITORIAL
Physical Review D
expands coverage of astrophysics and astronomy
January 24, 2022
With the goal of broadening its coverage of astrophysics, PRD hired astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz as an Associate Editor and appointed three experts in astrophysics to its Editorial Board.
NEWS AND COMMENTARY
The Solar System as a Black Hole Detector
September 17, 2024
An asteroid-mass primordial black hole flying near a planet could perturb the planet’s orbit by a detectable amount.
Synopsis on:
Tung X. Tran, Sarah R. Geller, Benjamin V. Lehmann, and David I. Kaiser
Phys. Rev. D

EDITORS' SUGGESTION
Case for Centaurus A as the main source of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays
The authors study in thorough detail the possibility that a dominant fraction of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (above 5 EeV) stems from the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. They provide remarkably comprehensive and meticulous predictions for the energy spectrum, the measured chemical composition, and anisotropy of the cosmic radiation and show that the influence of the extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields is crucial to match observations.

Signatures of Gravitational Atoms from Black Hole Mergers
September 16, 2024
Gravitational-wave signals from black hole mergers could reveal the presence of “gravitational atoms”—black holes surrounded by clouds of axions or other light bosons.

EDITORS' SUGGESTION
Where are the supermassive black holes measured by PTAs?
The paper establishes a discrepancy in the inferred supermassive black hole mass density between gravitational-wave based estimates (from pulsar timing) and electromagnetic estimates (from galaxy scaling relations and the quasar luminosity function). Further, possible solutions are also discussed.

EDITORS' SUGGESTION
Formation of black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars is not trivial: Simulations of thermonuclear pulsations and explosions
The formation of supermassive black holes and their progenitors is an outstanding problem in astrophysics. The authors examine one progenitor scenario where these black holes form from the unstable collapse of supermassive stars. Running both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic calculations that account for the effects of general relativity, accretion and nuclear burning, they show that for much of parameter space, these accreting supermassive stars do not collapse, but rather explode dues to nuclear energy.

Irreversible Boltzmann samplers in dense liquids: Weak-coupling approximation and mode-coupling theory
Using irreversible dynamics in a system of interacting particles can speed up its approach to the Boltzmann steady state. The authors explore this effect by studying a three-dimensional simple liquid with additional transverse pairwise forces, leading to theoretical insights that are in good agreement with available numerical results

PERSPECTIVE
Reversible to irreversible transitions in periodic driven many-body systems and future directions for classical and quantum systems
Reversible to irreversible (R-IR) transitions have been found in a wide variety of both soft and hard matter periodically driven collectively interacting systems that, after a certain number of driving cycles, organize into either a reversible state where the particle trajectories repeat during every or every few cycles or into a chaotic motion state. An overview of R-IR transitions including recent advances in the field is followed by a discussion of how the general framework of R-IR transitions could be applied to a much broader class of nonequilibrium systems in which periodic driving occurs, including not only soft and hard condensed matter systems, but also astrophysics, biological systems, and social systems.

An interacting model of bosons is shown to be exactly solvable in the presence of disorder and arbitrary dissipation. It is used to demonstrate that cold atom systems may realize several dynamical interaction- and dissipation-induced phases, including skin-effect phases, bulk-localized phases, and Mott insulator variants.

Generation of ultrashort ion pulses from ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption
An efficient method to produce ion pulses in the picosecond timing regime based on electron-stimulated desorption is presented. Short photoelectron pulses are used to ionize adsorbants on a biased metallic plate. The resulting ion pulses show a well-defined timing structure for protons and heavier species. Also, molecular ions can be observed in the time-of-flight spectra, demonstrating the versatility of ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption in formation of ultrashort ion pulses, which are inherently synchronized to a laser trigger.

Role of the constriction angle on the clogging by bridging of suspensions of particles
Clogging may occur whenever particles flow through a confined system, and it is a significant issue that can impair a wide range of applications. It is shown that the clogging probability of suspensions can be decreased when the constriction angle of a system is reduced.

Low-excitation transport and separation of high-mass-ratio mixed-species ion chains
The low-excitation transport and separation of beryllium and calcium ion crystals in a Paul trap is demonstrated, overcoming significant challenges such as mode crossings between axial and radial modes and uncontrolled radial electric fields, which are exacerbated by the high mass ratio of the two species. By carefully controlling these factors, excitation levels as low as 1.4 phonons after the entire sequence are achieved, and an extension to up to four-ion mixed-species crystals is presented.

Universal hyperuniformity in active field theories
Active field theories are found to be universally hyperuniform, that is, density-fluctuation suppressed, despite stark differences in their respective short-range structure. Higher moments of the density fluctuations, however, reveal activity-dependent higher-order correlations that are not captured by conventional two-point measures that characterize hyperuniformity.

No drama in two-dimensional black hole evaporation
The formation of a black hole through gravitational collapse and subsequent evaporation via Hawking radiation is numerically simulated in a semiclassical, two-dimensional model of gravity. The black hole that is formed is a two-dimensional version of the regular Bardeen black hole and evaporates in finite time to an end state free of singularities or horizons that might endanger the unitarity of the process.

Magnetogenesis via the canonical battery effect
Despite the ubiquity of magnetic fields in plasmas, how a plasma spontaneously magnetizes itself is still a mystery, although there are several proposed mechanisms. Revisiting the plasma equation of motion reveals that an effect due to the pressure tensor, called the canonical battery effect, is responsible for magnetogenesis, encompassing all popular mechanisms and predicting new ones.

Exponentially faster preparation of quantum dimers via driven-dissipative stabilization

Origin of granular axial segregation bands in a rotating tumbler: An interface-mixing driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability
Axially segregated bands of large and small particles in a long rotating tumbler were first reported over 80 years ago, but the mechanism for band formation has eluded researchers. Simulations demonstrate that the bands form because of a granular Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability resulting from a dense layer of mixed large and small particles over a less dense layer of small particles.

Unidirectional spin waves measured using propagating-spin-wave spectroscopy
In some magnetic materials, spin-wave dispersion relations vary monotonically across the Brillouin zone, allowing wave packets with zero momentum to flow unidirectionally, which points to high-frequency spintronic applications. To get there, though, it is crucial to develop methods that can link a spin wave’s properties to experimentally accessible metrics. To this end, the authors use propagating-spin-wave spectroscopy to precisely measure the dispersion of unidirectional spin waves. Their method identifies the wave vector at a particular frequency, which was a limiting factor in previous studies. This metrological approach is sure to impact the study of thin-film magnetism.

Directional emission of a readout resonator for qubit measurement
Robust and scalable multiplexed qubit readout is essential for realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Conventional approaches rely on intentional mismatch of the feedline to provide directionality to the readout signal, at the cost of increased variation in resonator linewidth, which ultimately degrades quantum error correction. The authors address this challenge by demonstrating high-fidelity qubit readout using a readout resonator that emits photons preferentially toward the output, across its full bandwidth. By maintaining directional decay of the readout signal without intentional mismatch, this work presents a path toward the design of reliable, modular quantum processors.

Magnetic induction sensor based on a dual-frequency atomic magnetometer
Outstanding in the (magnetic) field: The authors demonstrate an alternative, self-stabilized radio-frequency atomic magnetometer (AM) for magnetic induction tomography. In contrast to traditional approaches that require extra devices for bias-field stabilization, this method employs a dual-frequency technique, enabling simultaneous measurement of static and oscillating magnetic fields through nonlinear Zeeman splitting, all with a single atomic sensor. Experimental results reveal marked improvements in sensitivity and stability for AM-based detection of eddy current.

Laser-frequency stabilization using light shift in compact atomic clocks
Fluctuations in laser frequency affect atomic clock stability (the so-called
light shift
), and stabilization is required, typically entailing additional complicated gear. This study shows how to turn the light shift from a nuisance to an amazing resource for compact atomic frequency standards. Exploiting the dispersive behavior of the light shift, the authors stabilize the laser frequency to the same atoms that are involved in the clock’s operation, without the need for any external reference. This technique results in significant hardware simplification, which is quite advantageous for industrial and space applications, where compact and robust automatic laser-frequency stabilization is especially valuable.

Trusted-source-noise model of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution
The system’s source noise affects the practical performance of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution. The good news: This noise exists inside the system and cannot be exploited by eavesdroppers, so it can be trusted. However, a lack of appropriate modeling leaves a security-key-rate gap, omitting this trusted noise. The authors propose a model for trusted source noise in the discrete-modulated protocol, successfully mitigating the negative impact of an imperfect source on system performance while maintaining security of the protocol, and thus promoting practical deployment.

Asymmetric transmission of electrons in ballistic graphene
Exploring asymmetric transmission in graphene is critical for advancing microelectronics, particularly applications such as rectifiers, demodulators, and logic gates. In monolayer graphene, however, the absent band gap and Klein tunneling make this challenging. This research focuses on breaking spatial-inversion symmetry by utilizing a four-layer array of quantum dots that integrates the functions of both electron metasurfaces and band-gap materials. The results seem promising for the development of devices that rely on one-way electron transmission with nearly perfect efficiency and a simple design.

First-principles quantum Monte Carlo study of charge-carrier mobility in organic molecular semiconductors
Organic molecular semiconductors are very interesting, especially for optoelectronics such as displays, solar cells, flexible devices, and biosensors, offering lower cost and larger device areas than their silicon-based counterparts. Investigating them from first principles has seemed unfeasible to date, due to extremely high autocorrelation in the most promising Monte Carlo ansatz. The authors use a hybrid Monte Carlo method with exact Fourier acceleration to reduce the autocorrelation by several orders of magnitude, allowing high-precision simulations at low computational cost. This method is also widely applicable, beyond just the study of organic molecular semiconductors.

Decoupling elasticity and electrical conductivity of carbon-black gels filled with insulating non-Brownian grains
The interest in slurries formed by granular filler dispersed in colloidal gel is largely driven by the relevance to batteries, and the recent discovery of flow-switched bistability. This study extends previous investigations to make progress on elucidating the physics of such slurries. Surprisingly, the electrical and mechanical properties of the slurries can be either coupled or decoupled, depending on the conductive properties of the granular fillers. The different coordination numbers required for network rigidity and electrical percolation provide a key to understanding the decoupling, and important insight for optimizing the mixing and processing of industrial slurries.

The tunability of a system’s sigmoidal response is crucial in determining inference quality and learning efficiency for artificial neural networks. However, achieving such a response in a physical system remains technically challenging. In this Letter, the authors demonstrate an S-shaped response using a magnonic version of the classic parametron circuit, which exhibits two stable phase states when magnons are excited at twice their resonant frequency by a microwave pump. The steepness of this S can be tuned by the pump, via increasing dissipation due to magnon-magnon scattering. These results could pave the way for utilizing magnetic materials in neural-network applications.

Non-Hermitian topological ohmmeter
Measuring large electrical resistances is an essential part of common applications such as insulation testing, but it suffers from a fundamental problem: The larger the resistance, the less sensitive a canonical ohmmeter is. Here the authors use the topological properties of non-Hermitian matrices to design a multiple-current-source electrical circuit that functions as a highly precise ohmmeter. Both the sensitivity of the device and its signal-to-noise ratio increase
exponentially
as more and more current sources are included in the circuit, paving the way toward overcoming the intrinsic limitations of currently available measurement devices.

Intrinsic permeability of heterogeneous porous media
The traditional Kozeny-Carman formulation does not predict the permeability of complex porous structures. We develop an original model for the characterization of the intrinsic permeability of porous media with spatially heterogeneous pore size distributions. By conceptualizing the medium as a collection of smaller-scale porous units in series, our model captures spatial variability and aligns with microfluidics experiments on designed complex structures. Our model offers a fresh perspective beyond the traditional Kozeny-Carman formulation, enhancing our understanding of how pore size variability influences the overall medium permeability.

Adjoint-based computation of nonlocal eddy viscosity in turbulent channel flow
Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) closure operators are generally nonlocal and anisotropic, for example in wall-bounded turbulence. We introduce a computationally efficient approach to obtain these operators, using an adjoint formulation. We then quantify the streamwise and wall-normal nonlocal eddy viscosity in turbulent channel flow, which can be used to guide closure modeling.

Stability analysis of volatile liquid films in different evaporation regimes
We investigate the role that vapor diffusion plays in the evolution of an evaporating liquid film using a coupled liquid-vapor system in which the evaporation rate is dictated by both the film’s thickness and its curvature. Under this kinetic-diffusion model, the thermocapillary Marangoni effect is split into two distinct components: the first results from surface tension gradients driven by uneven heating while the second arises from surface tension gradients caused by imbalances in vapor diffusion. Notably, these two components interact with evaporative mass loss and vapor recoil in a rich and complex manner, which we analyze within the temporal and spatiotemporal frameworks.

Waves and structural strain induced by a uniform current flow underneath a semi-infinite floating solar coverage
Floating solar panels installed on water reservoirs are gradually becoming an increasingly popular renewable energy scenario. When the reservoir gate is opened to release water, complex interactions between an incoming current and the floating panels will occur. In this paper, by modeling the entire floating panel structure as a thin elastic plate, a mathematical model based on the linearized potential flow theory is established to investigate such interactions. Extensive analyses are conducted on the wave profile and plate deflection, revealing significant fluid resonance phenomena at certain current speeds.

Cavitation caused by an elastic membrane deforming under the jetting of a spark-induced bubble
A new and interesting phenomenon is found during the interaction between cavitation bubbles and elastic membranes: The collapse of the spark-induced bubble generates a high-speed jet. When the jet impacts the elastic membrane, significant membrane deformation occurs, accompanied by secondary cavitation. To analyze the mechanism of the secondary cavitation, fluid acceleration is introduced through PIV experiments to define the dimensionless inertial force. Secondary cavitation is triggered when the dimensionless inertial force surpasses the dimensionless pressure difference.

Laboratory study of wave turbulence under isotropic forcing
Experimental efforts to corroborate the theoretical Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum of surface gravity wave turbulence (WT) have encountered obstacles in the form of finite-size effects and intermittency. We investigated whether the consequences of these dynamics could be outcompeted by rigorously enforcing the assumption of WT in an idealized environment, in which we supply isotropic forcing and random-phased waves. We find that even under these conditions the wave field is modulated by dissipation and intermittency, which we study with higher-order statistics. Nevertheless, we do observe evidence of a wave-driven energy cascade beneath the strongly nonlinear and dissipative effects.

Waves beneath a drop levitating over a moving wall
This study elucidates the origin of traveling waves observed on the lower surface of a levitating droplet rolling on a rotating cylindrical drum. The research begins with a simplified model of the lubrication flow beneath the droplet and examines the linear stability of this base state to Tollmien–Schlichting-type perturbations. By solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation perturbatively, the study predicts the wavelength and phase velocity of the most unstable mode, yielding good agreement with experimental observations.

Viscosity of capsule suspensions: Effects of internal-external viscosity ratio and capsule rupture release
Polymer flooding is a popular method for enhancing oil recovery in the field of oil extraction. Experimental studies have shown that during injection, polymers experience significant viscosity loss due to shear degradation. To address the issues, a method of encapsulating polymers by synthesizing micro-nano capsules is proposed. The variation of viscosity of capsule suspension during the process of capsule rupture and polymer release are explored in details and an available law that relates suspension viscosity is established.

Examination of the onset and decay of turbulence in pipe flow
This figure displays the iso-surfaces of a turbulent puff’s azimuthal velocity. We have demonstrated that azimuthal motion is the primary cause of triggering the onset of turbulence, a chaotic state. Puffs abruptly break out of a chaotic state at Reynolds numbers Re < 1870, then decay exponentially. We found that the decay rate is entirely consistent with the cubic expression Sreenivasan used in 1979, but only after adding a constant.

Maximization of inertial waves focusing in linear and nonlinear regimes
This study investigates the focusing of inertial waves (IW) generated by an axisymmetric torus oscillating in a rotating fluid. A full range of vertical kinetic energy propagation angles at the focal point was explored using direct numerical simulations (DNS). A systematic comparison was made between linear DNS and nonlinear DNS. It was found that there is an optimal angle that maximizes energy transfer from the torus to the focal zone. In addition, triadic IW resonances were identified as a source of turbulence and a large central vertical vortex was also identified in agreement with the theory of Davidson et al. (2006).

Coupled volume of fluid and phase field method for direct numerical simulation of insoluble surfactant-laden interfacial flows and application to rising bubbles
We present an open-source Direct Numerical Simulation framework to analyze surfactant-laden flows. With adaptive mesh refinement and parallelization, this tool enables researchers to explore the effects of surfactants on interfacial flows, particularly their impact on rising bubbles. The simulations show that surfactants slow down bubbles and alter their trajectory. Such numerical frameworks on the solutal Marangoni effect are crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of multiphase flows in natural and industrial processes.

Stationary and nonstationary energy cascades in homogeneous ferrofluid turbulence
A universal energy cascade is studied for incompressible ferrofluid turbulence by means of exact relations. Under weak external magnetic field, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at similar rates. Upon increasing the strength of the external magnetic field, the total energy cascade becomes nonstationary and occurs at a rate different from that of the kinetic energy cascade. However, the scale independent nature of the cascade remains universal.

Spreading and engulfment of a viscoelastic film onto a Newtonian droplet
Through numerical simulations we reveal the three phase flow as a newtonian droplet comes in contact with an immiscible viscoelastic liquid film. The droplet dynamics becomes insensitive to the film height when the viscoelastic effects dominate. A viscoelastic ridge forms at the moving contact line, which evolves with a power-law dependence on time.

Deep reinforcement learning of airfoil pitch control in a highly disturbed environment using partial observations
This study uses deep reinforcement learning to design airfoil pitch control for minimizing lift variations in disturbed flows.

Modulational instability of nonuniformly damped, broad-banded waves: Applications to waves in sea ice
Modulational instability is the major energy transfer mechanism between ocean surface waves in deep water. In this work we explore the effects of nonuniform damping, such as that encountered by waves propagating through sea ice, on this important instability. We relax common assumptions about narrow spectral width but are nevertheless able to capture the dynamics of the unstable triad of waves using dynamical systems techniques. We elucidate the differences between uniform and nonuniform damping and explore the consequences for subsequent spectral broadening.

Laser-induced cavitation in liquid
He
4
near the liquid-vapor critical point
Cavitation near the critical point is unusual because the compressibility becomes very high and the density difference between liquid and vapor becomes small and vanishes completely in the single phase supercritical region. We have investigated laser-induced cavitation in this unusual regime with high speed video at up to 5 million frames per second using liquid helium as the working fluid. Our theoretical analysis shows that the pressure in the liquid outside a bubble can be much lower than the ambient pressure. Near the critical point, the low pressure liquid becomes unstable and generates a cloud of microbubbles, which is consistent with predictions of nucleation theory near the spinodal.

EDITORS' SUGGESTION
Impact of grain boundary energy anisotropy on grain growth
Recent observations of microstructure evolution during annealing revealed that grain growth not only reduces grain boundary area but also dissipates additional energy through a decrease in average grain boundary energy—a feature that isotropic simulations with uniform energy assumption fail to predict. The authors use a threshold dynamics model incorporating anisotropic grain boundary energies to simulate the observed grain growth of polycrystalline Ni. The model predicts an increase in the relative area of low-energy twin boundaries and a decrease in average boundary energy. This study highlights that realistic simulation of grain growth in polycrystals requires anisotropic grain boundary energy implementation.

Intrinsic origins of broad luminescence in melt-grown

single crystals
The authors present a detailed theoretical study of the optical behavior of native defects in zinc gallium oxide based on configuration coordinate diagrams derived from hybrid functional calculations. The resulting predicted luminescence lines are compared with low-temperature photoluminescence spectra measured on zinc gallium oxide single crystals grown from the melt. Based on this comparison, self-trapped holes, Zn antisites, Zn vacancies, and their complexes with Ga antisites are put forward as potential origins of the observed luminescence.

High mobility charge transport in a multicarrier altermagnet CrSb
Altermagnets are unconventional type of magnetic materials with intriguing properties. CrSb is particularly important because of its high ordering temperature and large spin-splitting energy. Here, the authors measured the magnetotransport properties of CrSb. Employing focused-ion-beam machining, they prepared micro-sized lamellar samples to measure all independent Hall tensor components. The Hall resistivity was highly non-linear at low temperatures, but an anomalous Hall effect was ruled out by symmetry-based considerations. Instead, the magnetotransport properties are well explained by a multicarrier effect. Notably, the analysis revealed the presence of carriers with the highest mobility reported for altermagnets so far.

Differing vibrational properties of halide and chalcogenide perovskite semiconductors and impact on optoelectronic performance
There is motivation to develop materials with photovoltaic performance comparable to halide perovskites but without the drawbacks of instability and toxicity. Chalcogenide perovskites are interesting because they have a tunable direct band gap and are very stable, but their optoelectronic properties are not yet well understood. This study of Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy of BaZrS

and CsPbBr

single-crystal samples reveals differences in their vibrational properties and explores how these differences affect nonradiative recombination rates. The results suggest that the usefulness of chalcogenide perovskites for photovoltaics will hinge on continued progress in defect control.

Deformation and failure of glassy polymer-polymer interfaces compatibilized by linear multiblock copolymers
When two different polymers are blended, they form phase-separated emulsions with weak interfaces. These recycled materials are inferior to the original plastics, posing a fundamental challenge for recycling mixed plastic waste streams. An emerging solution to this problem is the addition of a multiblock copolymer compatibilizer to “stitch together” the interface. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, Collanton and Dorfman examined how interfacial toughness is impacted by the number of blocks in the compatibilizer and the copolymer loading, connecting the microstructural features of the interface to its failure mechanism.

Two-step aging dynamics in enzymatic milk gels
In this study, the authors take advantage of the emergence time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy to investigate the formation and aging of enzymatic milk gels, made of soft natural colloids. By coupling rheometric measurements with structural characterizations, they reveal two sequential steps in the aging process. First, the open particulate network rapidly matures into a compact network, increasing gel elasticity and evolving the viscoelastic spectrum. Second, the microstructure “freezes” at a critical time, after which aging proceeds through contact-driven mechanisms. This two-step aging process is crucial for industrial cheese processing and contrasts with the aging of hard particle colloidal gels, where the overall network structure remains constant throughout aging.

About
Physics Physique физика
As a service to the community, APS has made the small journal “Physics Physique физика” freely available online. The journal published fewer than 100 articles during the period 1964-1968 in four volumes. In their
Editorial Foreword
, founding editors P. W. Anderson and B. T. Matthias explain that the experimental journal aimed to “alleviate the increasing problems of the communication of science.” During its brief run, the journal published papers by many notable physicists, including Gell-Mann, de Gennes, Ne’eman, Anderson, Abrikosov, and others. Perhaps the most significant paper published in the journal is J. S. Bell’s “
On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox
.” We anticipate readers will enjoy having this hard to find content readily available online.

About
PRX Quantum
PRX Quantum
is a highly selective, online-only, fully open access journal that publishes research with an emphasis on outstanding and lasting impact.
PRX Quantum
seeks to publish a select set of papers providing a home for and connection between the numerous research communities that make up quantum information science and technology, spanning from pure science to engineering to computer science and beyond.
Where Quantum Science and Technology Thrives
PRX Quantum
showcases research in core areas of quantum information science and technology that are milestone achievements in techniques, experiment, and theory, or that represents an important leap in understanding. Reflecting the diversity of this discipline, the journal publishes creative, impactful research that brings together multiple interdisciplinary fields. We are proud to be an integral part of this community, taking on the challenge of supporting and encouraging its development.
In addition to regular research articles we also present two other types of content: Perspectives and Tutorials. Perspectives are forward-looking articles, aimed at highlighting the significance of recent results, their possible reach and current limitations. The aim is to share the excitement of the field and, at the same time, inform on where new ideas and focused work could have an important impact. Tutorials serve a different purpose: they are hands-on guides for newcomers, aimed at speeding up the training of new experts. They should also aid in bridging the gap between the different parts of the community working on quantum science and technologies. Tutorials are expected to cover well-established concepts of particular relevance on timely topics.
Building on standards established by
Physical Review X

Abstract
The fluxonium qubit is a promising candidate for quantum computation due to its long coherence times and large anharmonicity. We present a tunable coupler that realizes strong inductive coupling between two heavy-fluxonium qubits, each with approximately
50
-MHz frequencies and approximately
5
-GHz anharmonicities. The coupler enables the qubits to have a large tuning range of
X
X
coupling strengths (
−
35
to 75 MHz). The
Z
Z
coupling strength is
<
3
kHz across the entire coupler bias range and
<
100
Hz at the coupler off position. These qualities lead to fast high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. By driving at the difference frequency of the two qubits, we realize a
i
SWAP
gate in 258 ns with fidelity 99.72%, and by driving at the sum frequency of the two qubits, we achieve a
b
SWAP
gate in 102 ns with fidelity 99.91%. This latter gate is only five qubit Larmor periods in length. We run cross-entropy benchmarking for over 20 consecutive hours and measure stable gate fidelities, with
b
SWAP
drift (
2
σ
)
<
0.02
%
and
i

Popular Summary
To implement transformative quantum computing algorithms, we need to create carefully controlled interactions between pairs of quantum bits. These two-qubit gates need to consistently perform well, in a metric referred to as gate fidelity. One promising platform for creating quantum processors is the heavy-fluxonium qubit, a circuit that breaks many conventional superconducting circuit paradigms with its low qubit frequencies and large anharmonicities. By leveraging the unique characteristics of the fluxonium qubit, we have realized a two-qubit gate with very high gate fidelities.
Our method for achieving such high-fidelity gates is to implement a tunable interaction between the fluxonium qubits. A key feature of our circuit’s coupler is that we can turn qubit interactions off, allowing us to achieve state-of-the-art single-qubit coherences and gate fidelities. However, when we want to execute a two-qubit gate, we can use an on-demand microwave signal to activate an extremely strong coupling—one that is an order of magnitude higher than previous couplers on such qubits. The combination of these two features enables our high gate fidelities, providing direction for future two-qubit-gate implementations on low-frequency qubits.
Our research demonstrates that heavy-fluxonium qubits can be used for immediate quantum applications and can also be a fundamental component of tomorrow’s scalable quantum information processors.

The fluxonium qubit is a promising candidate for quantum computation due to its long coherence times and large anharmonicity. We present a tunable coupler that realizes strong inductive coupling between two heavy-fluxonium qubits, each with approximately

Popular Summary
To implement transformative quantum computing algorithms, we need to create carefully controlled interactions between pairs of quantum bits. These two-qubit gates need to consistently perform well, in a metric referred to as gate fidelity. One promising platform for creating quantum processors is the heavy-fluxonium qubit, a circuit that breaks many conventional superconducting circuit paradigms with its low qubit frequencies and large anharmonicities. By leveraging the unique characteristics of the fluxonium qubit, we have realized a two-qubit gate with very high gate fidelities.
Our method for achieving such high-fidelity gates is to implement a tunable interaction between the fluxonium qubits. A key feature of our circuit’s coupler is that we can turn qubit interactions off, allowing us to achieve state-of-the-art single-qubit coherences and gate fidelities. However, when we want to execute a two-qubit gate, we can use an on-demand microwave signal to activate an extremely strong coupling—one that is an order of magnitude higher than previous couplers on such qubits. The combination of these two features enables our high gate fidelities, providing direction for future two-qubit-gate implementations on low-frequency qubits.
Our research demonstrates that heavy-fluxonium qubits can be used for immediate quantum applications and can also be a fundamental component of tomorrow’s scalable quantum information processors.

The device, circuit, and energy-level diagram. (a) Top panel: False-colored scanning electron microscope image of the two fluxoniums and coupler junction loops. Each qubit consists of a small Josephson junction (pink and yellow) and an array of large junctions as an inductor (blue and cyan). The coupler consists of a small Josephson junction (green) and a shorter array of junctions (orange). Bottom panel: optical microscope image of the flux control lines (light blue), readout resonators (purple), qubit shunting capacitors (red), and resonator drive and readout lines (brown).

Abstract
In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation, and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance, the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.

Popular Summary
Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes microscopic objects, for instance, atoms, photons, and electrons. At this scale, the outcome of a single measurement is inherently unpredictable and can be described by a probability distribution. However, it is not possible to associate a probability that is always positive to the outcomes from two consecutive measurements of two incompatible quantities, for instance, position and momentum. This is where the concept of “quasiprobabilities” comes into play. In this tutorial, we explain how quasiprobabilities, mathematical functions that resemble probability distributions but are not always positive real numbers, become extremely useful in the description of evolving quantum systems.
In this tutorial, after introducing the formalism of quasiprobabilities and the fundamental concepts, we illustrate how to infer them from real experiments. We apply this framework to two key areas of quantum science. First, we explore the thermodynamics of quantum systems that are not in equilibrium and discuss the quasiprobability distribution for work and heat generated in their time evolution. Second, we investigate the time evolution of quantum many-body systems, where the onset of chaos and information scrambling can be inferred from quasiprobabilities.
The fundamental tools explained in this tutorial may be employed for the description of complex quantum phenomena and for gaining a deeper understanding of quantum science and information.

Abstract
Majorana bound states (MBSs) are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles. They are predicted to emerge as zero-energy modes localized at the boundary of a topological superconductor. No intrinsic topological superconductor is known to date. However, by interfacing conventional superconductors and semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, it is possible to create a system hosting topological states. Hence, epitaxial superconductors and semiconductors have emerged as an attractive material system with atomically sharp interfaces and broad flexibility in device fabrications incorporating Josephson junctions. We discuss the basics of topological superconductivity and provide insight into how to go beyond current state-of-the-art experiments. We argue that the ultimate success in realizing MBS physics requires the observation of non-Abelian braiding and fusion experiments.

Popular Summary
Topological superconductors are exotic materials with unique physical properties. One such property is the ability to create a type of particle that is unlike any other particle known to exist in our three-dimensional universe. Aside from bringing into being something fundamentally new, these particles can be used as error-free building blocks of quantum technologies with unique capabilities that vastly outperform their nonquantum counterparts. Although the theoretical foundation underpinning topological superconductors is strong, the experimental effort to discover or synthesize such a material is ongoing. The most promising route so far is to merge the disparate ingredients of topological superconductivity into a single material structure by integrating commonplace superconductors, semiconductors, and magnetism.
In this Perspective, we review recent progress towards creating a topological superconductor and highlight the major outstanding challenges that remain to be overcome. Focusing on hybrid materials, we identify a number of superconductors and semiconductors that have yet to be extensively explored for this purpose, discuss the challenges involved in interfacing them, and weigh their relative advantages and disadvantages. We further discuss how the existence of a topological superconductor might be unambiguously confirmed, how disorder in the material can be characterized and mitigated, and how new device geometries and experimental methods can be leveraged. This work should aid researchers from various specialties who are interested in the pursuit of a robust topological superconductor.

Abstract
Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a form of quantum teleportation in which no corrective unitary is required on the part of the receiver. Two primary regimes exist—deterministic PBT in which teleportation is always successful, but is imperfect, and probabilistic PBT, in which teleportation succeeds with probability less than one, but teleportation is perfect upon a success. Two further regimes exist within each of these, in which the resource state used for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state or free to be optimized. Recent works have resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for qudits. Here, we provide algorithms in all four regimes for qubits. Emphasis is placed on the practicality of these algorithms, where we give polynomial improvements in the known gate complexity for PBT, as well as an exponential improvement in the required number of ancillas (albeit in separate protocols). Our approach to the implementation of the square-root measurement in PBT can be directly generalized to other highly symmetric state ensembles. For certain families of states, such a framework yields efficient algorithms in the case in which the Petz-recovery algorithm for the square-root measurement runs in exponential time.

Popular Summary
The original quantum teleportation protocol from 1993 is one of the most foundational primitives in quantum information theory. A generalization of this operation, port-based teleportation (PBT), was introduced in 2009 to address a shortcoming in the earlier approach—the need for the receiver to apply a correction to the teleported state. PBT has found practical applications in quantum computing as well as theoretical connections to areas across quantum information and even beyond—in the theory of holography and the AdS-CFT correspondence.
However, as a noticeably more complex procedure than standard teleportation, it has been an open question for some 15 years as to how PBT might be implemented efficiently, presenting a bottleneck both to its applicability and our theoretical understanding of the protocol. This has been resolved recently but only for one type of PBT—the deterministic setting. We now complete this breakthrough by showing how all the different flavors of PBT may be implemented efficiently. We go further than this—showing polynomial improvements in the number of gates required to implement PBT, as well as an exponential improvement in the number of ancillary qubits required for the implementation. Our protocols thus greatly increase the possibility of a physical realization of PBT.
The framework that we leverage for designing our algorithms has exciting potential for other uses—being generalizable to other cases of the square-root measurement, a ubiquitous operation in quantum information theory. Therefore, we believe that this work will lead to further theoretical advances in quantum information-theoretic protocol design.

Abstract
Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the

down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of

at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control-pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.

Popular Summary
To unleash the computational power of quantum computers, it is necessary to improve quantum logic gates to achieve low errors to enable the execution of deep quantum circuits, short gate durations that lead to a high clock speed, and straightforward yet robust calibration of the control parameters. However, these goals are typically conflicting. For example, short control pulses with a wide frequency-domain bandwidth may excite the most widely used superconducting qubit, the transmon, into higher-energy states, causing leakage errors. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new approach to shape single-qubit control pulses, leading to a low gate error for fast logic gates while allowing efficient calibration.
In contrast to previous methods, the proposed approach enables strong and configurable suppression of spectral energy across frequency intervals covering harmful leakage transitions. Importantly, we achieve this using analytical pulse shapes, providing a mapping between frequency-domain and time-domain parameters. In experiments using a transmon qubit, the proposed approach reduced the leakage error of 6.2-ns single-qubit gates by a factor of 7 compared to the previous record for fast transmon-based gates obtained using an optimal control method. The proposed approach not only enabled a shorter gate duration but also reduced the overall gate error compared to state-of-the-art methods based on derivative removal by adiabatic gate.
The proposed approach provides a general framework for shaping control pulses in the presence of undesired transitions, and thus it has the potential to also improve simultaneous single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates. As the proposed methods are agnostic of quantum computing architecture, their applications may extend beyond superconducting qubits.

Abstract
Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the
e

transition of a transmon qubit with an anharmonicity of

MHz, we implement

down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of

at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control-pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.

Popular Summary
To unleash the computational power of quantum computers, it is necessary to improve quantum logic gates to achieve low errors to enable the execution of deep quantum circuits, short gate durations that lead to a high clock speed, and straightforward yet robust calibration of the control parameters. However, these goals are typically conflicting. For example, short control pulses with a wide frequency-domain bandwidth may excite the most widely used superconducting qubit, the transmon, into higher-energy states, causing leakage errors. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new approach to shape single-qubit control pulses, leading to a low gate error for fast logic gates while allowing efficient calibration.
In contrast to previous methods, the proposed approach enables strong and configurable suppression of spectral energy across frequency intervals covering harmful leakage transitions. Importantly, we achieve this using analytical pulse shapes, providing a mapping between frequency-domain and time-domain parameters. In experiments using a transmon qubit, the proposed approach reduced the leakage error of 6.2-ns single-qubit gates by a factor of 7 compared to the previous record for fast transmon-based gates obtained using an optimal control method. The proposed approach not only enabled a shorter gate duration but also reduced the overall gate error compared to state-of-the-art methods based on derivative removal by adiabatic gate.
The proposed approach provides a general framework for shaping control pulses in the presence of undesired transitions, and thus it has the potential to also improve simultaneous single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates. As the proposed methods are agnostic of quantum computing architecture, their applications may extend beyond superconducting qubits.

Abstract
Color codes are promising quantum error-correction (QEC) codes because they have an advantage over surface codes in that all Clifford gates can be implemented transversally. However, the thresholds of color codes under circuit-level noise are relatively low, mainly because measurements of their high-weight stabilizer generators cause an increase in the circuit depth and, thus, substantial errors are introduced. This makes color codes not the best candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we propose a method to suppress the impact of such errors by optimizing weights of decoders using conditional error probabilities conditioned on the measurement outcomes of flag qubits. In numerical simulations, we improve the threshold of the (4.8.8) color code under circuit-level noise from 0.14% to around 0.27%, which is calculated by using an integer programming decoder. Furthermore, in the (6.6.6) color code, we achieve a circuit-level threshold of around 0.36%, which is almost the same value as the highest value in the previous studies employing the same noise model. In both cases, the effective code distance is also improved compared to a conventional method that uses a single ancilla qubit for each stabilizer measurement. Thereby, the achieved logical error rates at low physical error rates are almost one order of magnitude lower than those of the conventional method with the same code distance. Even when compared to the single-ancilla method with a higher code distance, considering the increased number of qubits used in our method, we achieve lower logical error rates in most cases. This method can also be applied to other weight-based decoders, making the color codes more promising as candidates for the experimental implementation of QEC. Furthermore, one can utilize this approach to improve a threshold of wider classes of QEC codes, such as high-rate quantum low-density parity-check codes.

Popular Summary
Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential ingredient to realize a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In QEC, it is crucial for a protocol to have a high noise threshold. Color codes are one of the promising QEC codes because of their ability to implement certain quantum gates fault tolerantly. Nevertheless, color codes are currently not the best candidate because of their low noise threshold.
We propose a way to optimize a parameter in a decoder that corresponds to the likelihood of errors occurring, leading to the improvement in the noise threshold and the logical error rates. The key idea is to utilize specific ancilla qubits that can flag errors propagating badly in a quantum circuit and then incorporate the error information caught by them into the parameter of a decoder. It enables the decoder to estimate errors more accurately.
Our approach is versatile in that it can be applied to any weight-based decoders and wider classes of QEC codes, playing a crucial role in advancing the research field.

leads to the estimation of errors as depicted in the right figure. It results in a logical error after the recovery operation. The actual data errors are also displayed in the left figure, even though they cannot be identified in actual scenarios. (b) With deflagging. After performing the deflagging procedure and then decoding based on the conditional error probabilities in Fig.

However, the thresholds of color codes under circuit-level noise are relatively low, mainly because measurements of their high-weight stabilizer generators cause an increase in the circuit depth and, thus, substantial errors are introduced. This makes color codes not the best candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we propose a method to suppress the impact of such errors by optimizing weights of decoders using conditional error probabilities conditioned on the measurement outcomes of flag qubits. In numerical simulations, we improve the threshold of the (4.8.8) color code under circuit-level noise from 0.14% to around 0.27%, which is calculated by using an integer programming decoder. Furthermore, in the (6.6.6) color code, we achieve a circuit-level threshold of around 0.36%, which is almost the same value as the highest value in the previous studies employing the same noise model. In both cases, the effective code distance is also improved compared to a conventional method that uses a single ancilla qubit for each stabilizer measurement. Thereby, the achieved logical error rates at low physical error rates are almost one order of magnitude lower than those of the conventional method with the same code distance. Even when compared to the single-ancilla method with a higher code distance, considering the increased number of qubits used in our method, we achieve lower logical error rates in most cases. This method can also be applied to other weight-based decoders, making the color codes more promising as candidates for the experimental implementation of QEC. Furthermore, one can utilize this approach to improve a threshold of wider classes of QEC codes, such as high-rate quantum low-density parity-check codes.

errors. (a) Without deflagging. When errors occur in the syndrome-measurement circuit and cause the measurement outcomes shown in the left figure, decoding based on the conditional error probabilities in Fig.
17
leads to the estimation of errors as depicted in the right figure. It results in a logical error after the recovery operation. The actual data errors are also displayed in the left figure, even though they cannot be identified in actual scenarios. (b) With deflagging. After performing the deflagging procedure and then decoding based on the conditional error probabilities in Fig.

Abstract
Strong quantum correlated sources are essential but delicate resources for quantum information science and engineering protocols. Decoherence and loss are the two main disruptive processes that lead to the loss of nonclassical behavior in quantum correlations. In quantum systems, scattering can contribute to both decoherence and loss. In this work, we present an experimental scheme capable of significantly mitigating the adverse impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our quantum system is composed of a two-mode squeezed light generated with the four-wave-mixing process in hot rubidium vapor and a scatterer is introduced to one of the two modes. An integrating sphere is then placed after the scatterer to recollect the scattered photons. We use mutual information between the two modes as the measure of quantum correlations and demonstrate a 47.5% mutual information recovery from scattering, despite an enormous photon loss of greater than 85%. Our scheme is the very first step toward recovering quantum correlations from disruptive random processes and thus has the potential to bridge the gap between proof-of-principle demonstrations and practical real-world implementations of quantum protocols.

Popular Summary
Strong quantum correlated sources are crucial in quantum information science and engineering protocols, but they are inherently fragile. Decoherence and loss are the primary processes that disrupt these quantum correlations, leading to the degradation of nonclassical behavior. Scattering, a common phenomenon in quantum systems, contributes to both decoherence and loss, posing a significant challenge to maintaining quantum advantage in quantum protocols.
In this work, we introduce an experimental scheme designed to mitigate the adverse effects of scattering on quantum systems. Our setup uses a two-mode squeezed light source generated via the four-wave mixing process in atomic rubidium vapor. To simulate scattering, we introduce a scatterer into one of the two modes. To counteract the resulting photon scattering, an integrating sphere is placed after the scatterer to recollect scattered photons. By measuring the mutual information between the two modes, which quantifies quantum correlations, we assess the effectiveness of our approach in recovering lost quantum correlations between the two modes. Our results are promising, showing a 47.5% recovery of mutual information despite a significant photon loss of over 85%, which suggests an effective reduction of the impact of scattering on the quantum correlations in our quantum system.
This work represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between proof-of-principle quantum demonstrations and practical real-world quantum information protocols, offering a potential pathway for implementing robust quantum technologies in environments with unavoidable disruptive processes.

vapor cell generates strong quantum correlated “twin” beams, i.e., the “probe” and “conjugate” beams, via FWM. A 5-cm-diameter integrating sphere (IS) is placed on the probe beam path and a “scatterer,” i.e., a 0.5-in.-diameter ground-glass diffuser, is placed at the entrance aperture of the IS. The focused probe beam is incident on the specular side of the diffuser. The other side (facing the IS) of the diffuser has 120 grits, which can produce near-spherical scattering patterns. A lens is attached to the exit aperture of the IS to collect escaped probe photons from IS and send them to a homemade photodetector. PBS, polarizing beam splitter; TEC, thermoelectric cooler.

Abstract
Quantum processors require a signal-delivery architecture with high addressability (low crosstalk) to ensure high performance already at the scale of dozens of qubits. Signal crosstalk causes inadvertent driving of quantum gates, which will adversely affect quantum gate fidelities in scaled-up devices. Here, we demonstrate packaged flip-chip superconducting quantum processors with signal-crosstalk performance competitive with those reported in other platforms. For capacitively coupled qubit-drive lines, we find on-resonant crosstalk better than
−
27
dB (average
−
37
dB). For inductively coupled magnetic-flux-drive lines, we find less than 0.13% direct-current flux crosstalk (average 0.05%). These observed crosstalk levels are adequately small and indicate a decreasing trend with increasing distance, which is promising for further scaling up to larger numbers of qubits. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of a low-crosstalk on-chip signal-delivery architecture, including the influence of a shielding tunnel structure, potential sources of crosstalk, and estimation of crosstalk-induced qubit-gate error in scaled-up quantum processors.

Popular Summary
Quantum computers have the potential to address complex problems beyond the capacity of current supercomputers. The main challenge is to scale hardware to handle such tasks. A popular method involves an array of tiny superconducting devices on a low-loss chip, controlled by on-chip transmission lines. As the number of devices increases, crosstalk, which is an unintended control of components within the processor, can have harmful effect on the quantum computation.
Our study introduces an on-chip signal-delivery architecture in a flip-chip multiqubit processor with competitive crosstalk performance across different platforms. The flip-chip design supports high qubit coherence and separates the qubit, control, and readout elements onto two different chips, effectively doubling the layout space. Our measurements show not just a low level of crosstalk initially but also a decrease in average crosstalk with increasing distance. This is a needed trait in view of the grand challenges ahead in producing even larger high-performance quantum computers.
This study underscores the promising potential of engineering quantum processors based on superconducting circuits. The flexibility in designing more refined signal-delivery strategies will open further pathways toward reducing the crosstalk to a negligible level. This will ultimately impact the device-architecture road map, simplify the chip-level design strategy, and streamline the device-calibration routine.

Abstract
Quantum processors require a signal-delivery architecture with high addressability (low crosstalk) to ensure high performance already at the scale of dozens of qubits. Signal crosstalk causes inadvertent driving of quantum gates, which will adversely affect quantum gate fidelities in scaled-up devices. Here, we demonstrate packaged flip-chip superconducting quantum processors with signal-crosstalk performance competitive with those reported in other platforms. For capacitively coupled qubit-drive lines, we find on-resonant crosstalk better than
−
27
dB (average
−
37
dB). For inductively coupled magnetic-flux-drive lines, we find less than 0.13% direct-current flux crosstalk (average 0.05%). These observed crosstalk levels are adequately small and indicate a decreasing trend with increasing distance, which is promising for further scaling up to larger numbers of qubits. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of a low-crosstalk on-chip signal-delivery architecture, including the influence of a shielding tunnel structure, potential sources of crosstalk, and estimation of crosstalk-induced qubit-gate error in scaled-up quantum processors.

Popular Summary
Quantum computers have the potential to address complex problems beyond the capacity of current supercomputers. The main challenge is to scale hardware to handle such tasks. A popular method involves an array of tiny superconducting devices on a low-loss chip, controlled by on-chip transmission lines. As the number of devices increases, crosstalk, which is an unintended control of components within the processor, can have harmful effect on the quantum computation.
Our study introduces an on-chip signal-delivery architecture in a flip-chip multiqubit processor with competitive crosstalk performance across different platforms. The flip-chip design supports high qubit coherence and separates the qubit, control, and readout elements onto two different chips, effectively doubling the layout space. Our measurements show not just a low level of crosstalk initially but also a decrease in average crosstalk with increasing distance. This is a needed trait in view of the grand challenges ahead in producing even larger high-performance quantum computers.
This study underscores the promising potential of engineering quantum processors based on superconducting circuits. The flexibility in designing more refined signal-delivery strategies will open further pathways toward reducing the crosstalk to a negligible level. This will ultimately impact the device-architecture road map, simplify the chip-level design strategy, and streamline the device-calibration routine.

Abstract
In this work, we implement a new method for imaging ultracold atoms with subwavelength resolution capabilities and determine its regime of validity. It uses the laser-driven interaction between excited states to engineer hyperfine ground-state population transfer in a three-level system on scales much smaller than the optical resolution. Subwavelength imaging of a quantum gas is atypical in the sense that the measurement itself perturbs the dynamics of the system. To avoid induced dynamics affecting the measurement, one usually “rapidly” measures the wave function in a so-called strong imaging regime. We experimentally illustrate this regime using a thermal gas ensemble, and demonstrate subwavelength resolution in quantitative agreement with a fully analytical model. Additionally, we show that, counterintuitively, the opposite weak imaging regime can also be exploited to reach subwavelength resolution. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this regime is a robust solution to select and spatially resolve a 30-nm-wide wave function, which was created and singled out from a tightly confined one-dimensional optical lattice. Using a general dissipation-included formalism, we derive validity criteria for both regimes. The formalism is applicable to other subwavelength methods.

Popular Summary
We have developed an innovative method for quantum gas microscope imaging, showcasing impressive subwavelength resolution capabilities. By leveraging laser-driven interactions with the rich excited level structure of atoms, this technique allows for the precise engineering of ground-state transfer on scales much smaller than the conventional optical resolution (390 nm). Experimental results align well with a comprehensive toy model, offering not only a quantitative characterization of the method but also a predictive framework for estimating the achievable performance in any light-field configuration.
Quantum gas microscopes study cold neutral atoms in optical lattices and play a pivotal role in the quantum simulations of solid states that target the unveiling of quantum properties of solids. Our approach addresses challenges related to the far-field diffraction limit, a fundamental constraint in imaging. This work is inspired by pioneering super-resolution techniques developed by the bioimaging community. By carefully engineering the spatial dependence of an atomic transition frequency, we control the optical response of a quantum gas over nanometer scales. We demonstrate the method's capabilities by selecting and imaging a compressed quantum gas whose extension is theoretically predicted to be around 30 nm and experimentally measured at 45 nm.
This advancement holds promise for enhancing quantum simulations, providing a means to study strongly correlated phases with tenths of a nanometer resolution, thus surpassing traditional diffraction-limited systems. Beyond quantum simulation, this research opens new solutions to manipulate and create quantum gas with long-range order with applications in quantum communication and storage.

Abstract
One of the most prominent application areas for quantum computers is solving hard constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. However, detailed analyses of the complexity of standard quantum algorithms have suggested that outperforming classical methods for these problems would require extremely large and powerful quantum computers. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed for near-term quantum computers, yet previous work has shown strong limitations on the ability of QAOA to outperform classical algorithms for optimization problems. Here we instead apply QAOA to hard constraint satisfaction problems, where both classical and quantum algorithms are expected to require exponential time. We analytically characterize the average success probability of QAOA on a constraint satisfaction problem commonly studied using statistical physics methods: random
k
-SAT at the threshold for satisfiability, as the number of variables
n
goes to infinity. We complement these theoretical results with numerical experiments on the performance of QAOA for small
n
, which match the limiting theoretical bounds closely. We then compare QAOA with leading classical solvers. For random 8-SAT, we find that for more than 14 quantum circuit layers, QAOA achieves more efficient scaling than the highest-performance classical solver we tested, WalkSATlm. Our results suggest that near-term quantum algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems may outperform their classical counterparts.

Popular Summary
Combinatorial optimization—optimizing a function over a discrete domain—is considered a promising application of quantum computers. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is the best-known near-term quantum algorithm for this task. The algorithm nonetheless poses several challenges. On the theoretical side, the techniques for predicting the algorithm's performance remain limited. On the practical side, QAOA depends on a set of hyperparameters to be tuned; this task could potentially be a difficult optimization problem of its own.
In this work, we address these issues for a specific combinatorial optimization problem:
k
-SAT, one of the most fundamental and well-studied problems in computer science. When applying QAOA to this constraint satisfaction problem, we aim at producing an exact solution (satisfying all constraints) rather than maximizing the quality of the solution, as is usually done in the literature. Also, we use common QAOA hyperparameters for all
k
-SAT instances rather than training them on an instance-by-instance basis. In this setting, we develop analytic methods to estimate the probability of QAOA outputting an exact solution to
k
-SAT as the instance size goes to infinity. These results are validated and complemented by a set of numerical experiments, pointing to a potential advantage of QAOA over best-known classical algorithms for
k
-SAT.
A natural next step in this line of research is to determine the ultimate extent of the acceleration over classical algorithms and to shed light on the problem structures QAOA leverages to achieve speedup.

APS Releases Refreshed Data Availability Policy for the Physical Review Journals
The
American Physical Society
has refreshed its
data availability policy
to reflect a commitment to transparent and ethical research. All articles published in the
Physical Review journals
will now feature a statement detailing where data required to support or replicate the claims can be accessed. This new policy goes into effect Sept. 4 for articles submitted to
Physical Review D
and
PRX Energy
, and will take effect for articles submitted to the remaining journals by the end of the year.
Previously, APS strongly encouraged authors to include data availability statements that detailed where relevant data, code, and other material used in the work could be accessed. Now, authors must select one of several pre-scripted data availability statements.  The public sharing of data itself remains encouraged. Authors who do not provide data publicly must offer justification and their data must still be shared privately with referees and editors upon request.
Data availability statements in the Physical Review journals support independent verification of findings — a key part of the scientific process that advances open science publishing practices. Authors with questions about the policy’s implementation or readers who cannot access data for a published article can contact
APS’s editorial office
.

journals. A full list of the Outstanding Referees is
available online
.
The Outstanding Referee program was instituted in 2008 to recognize scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the
Physical Review
journals. By means of the program, APS expresses its appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles – even those that are not published by APS. In 2024, 156 Outstanding Referees representing over 62 different countries were selected. Our Editors select the honorees based on the quality, number, and timeliness of their reports, without regard for membership in the APS, country of origin, or field of research. Referees are rewarded for their work carried out since 1978, the earliest year for which we have accurate data on referee reports returned. The decisions are difficult and there are many excellent referees who have yet to be recognized.
All recipients of this distinction have been notified, and will be sent a lapel pin and a certificate to commemorate their achievement. The selection for this achievement is always difficult and APS expresses its appreciation to all referees who help make the
Physical Review
collection some of the most cited physics journals in the world.
The efforts of these individuals not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors improve the quality and readability of their articles—even those that are not published by APS. The Outstanding Referees are to be congratulated and thanked for their outstanding service to the physics community.

Outstanding Referees Program
The Outstanding Referee program was instituted in 2008 to recognize scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the APS journals. By means of the program, APS expresses its appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles – even those that are not published by APS.
The highly selective Outstanding Referee program annually recognizes about 150 of the roughly 91,600 currently active referees.  Like Fellowship in the APS, this is a lifetime award. In this year, 2024, 156 Outstanding Referees were selected. Our Editors select the honorees based on the quality, number, and timeliness of their reports, without regard for membership in the APS, country of origin, or field of research. Referees are rewarded for their work carried out since 1978, the earliest year for which we have accurate data on referee reports returned. The decisions are difficult and there are many excellent referees who are still to be recognized.
The honorees come from over 58 different countries. All listed in the table have been notified, offered the option of anonymity, and will receive a lapel pin and a certificate.
The Outstanding Referees are to be congratulated and thanked for their outstanding service to the physics community.

Outstanding Referees Program
The Outstanding Referee program was instituted in 2008 to recognize scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the APS journals. By means of the program, APS expresses its appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles – even those that are not published by APS.
The highly selective Outstanding Referee program annually recognizes about 150 of the roughly 91,600 currently active referees.  Like Fellowship in the APS, this is a lifetime award. In this year, 2024, 156 Outstanding Referees were selected. Our Editors select the honorees based on the quality, number, and timeliness of their reports, without regard for membership in the APS, country of origin, or field of research. Referees are rewarded for their work carried out since 1978, the earliest year for which we have accurate data on referee reports returned. The decisions are difficult and there are many excellent referees who are still to be recognized.
The honorees come from over 58 different countries. All listed in the table have been notified, offered the option of anonymity, and will receive a lapel pin and a certificate.
The Outstanding Referees are to be congratulated and thanked for their outstanding service to the physics community.

APS Releases Refreshed Data Availability Policy for the Physical Review Journals
The
American Physical Society
has refreshed its
data availability policy
to reflect a commitment to transparent and ethical research. All articles published in the
Physical Review journals
will now feature a statement detailing where data required to support or replicate the claims can be accessed. This new policy goes into effect Sept. 4 for articles submitted to
Physical Review D
and
PRX Energy
, and will take effect for articles submitted to the remaining journals by the end of the year.
Previously, APS strongly encouraged authors to include data availability statements that detailed where relevant data, code, and other material used in the work could be accessed. Now, authors must select one of several pre-scripted data availability statements.  The public sharing of data itself remains encouraged. Authors who do not provide data publicly must offer justification and their data must still be shared privately with referees and editors upon request.
Data availability statements in the Physical Review journals support independent verification of findings — a key part of the scientific process that advances open science publishing practices. Authors with questions about the policy’s implementation or readers who cannot access data for a published article can contact
APS’s editorial office
.

APS Announces Outstanding Referees for 2024
APS has selected 156 Outstanding Referees for 2024
who have demonstrated exceptional work in the assessment of manuscripts published in the
Physical Review
journals. A full list of the Outstanding Referees is
available online
.
The Outstanding Referee program was instituted in 2008 to recognize scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the
Physical Review
journals. By means of the program, APS expresses its appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles – even those that are not published by APS. In 2024, 156 Outstanding Referees representing over 62 different countries were selected. Our Editors select the honorees based on the quality, number, and timeliness of their reports, without regard for membership in the APS, country of origin, or field of research. Referees are rewarded for their work carried out since 1978, the earliest year for which we have accurate data on referee reports returned. The decisions are difficult and there are many excellent referees who have yet to be recognized.
All recipients of this distinction have been notified, and will be sent a lapel pin and a certificate to commemorate their achievement. The selection for this achievement is always difficult and APS expresses its appreciation to all referees who help make the
Physical Review
collection some of the most cited physics journals in the world.
The efforts of these individuals not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors improve the quality and readability of their articles—even those that are not published by APS. The Outstanding Referees are to be congratulated and thanked for their outstanding service to the physics community.

About
PRX Quantum
PRX Quantum
is a highly selective, online-only, fully open access journal that publishes research with an emphasis on outstanding and lasting impact.
PRX Quantum
seeks to publish a select set of papers providing a home for and connection between the numerous research communities that make up quantum information science and technology, spanning from pure science to engineering to computer science and beyond.
Where Quantum Science and Technology Thrives
PRX Quantum
showcases research in core areas of quantum information science and technology that are milestone achievements in techniques, experiment, and theory, or that represents an important leap in understanding. Reflecting the diversity of this discipline, the journal publishes creative, impactful research that brings together multiple interdisciplinary fields. We are proud to be an integral part of this community, taking on the challenge of supporting and encouraging its development.
In addition to regular research articles we also present two other types of content: Perspectives and Tutorials. Perspectives are forward-looking articles, aimed at highlighting the significance of recent results, their possible reach and current limitations. The aim is to share the excitement of the field and, at the same time, inform on where new ideas and focused work could have an important impact. Tutorials serve a different purpose: they are hands-on guides for newcomers, aimed at speeding up the training of new experts. They should also aid in bridging the gap between the different parts of the community working on quantum science and technologies. Tutorials are expected to cover well-established concepts of particular relevance on timely topics.

ORCID iDs
Do the links go to the correct records? To avoid delays, APS does not add ORCIDs to papers after the first set of proofs is returned.
Funder information
Review grant numbers for accuracy.
Equations and tables
APS converts the original source file to XML, which is used to create the online version and the PDF. This conversion works well for most cases, but please check equations and tables carefully.
Post-publication contact author
Ensure there is a byline footnote giving the email address of the author to whom correspondence should be addressed (Contact author: author@email.com).
Post-Publication Corrections and Changes
The journals offer a variety of ways to correct the scientific record after publication, including Corrections and Author Name Changes. Visit the

Refer to the following guidelines when preparing Supplemental Material.
Content
A paper must stand on its own and be understandable and convincing without Supplemental Material. Editors may ask you to incorporate Supplemental Material into a paper as main text or Appendices. Editors may also ask you to convert a Letter into a longer Article to allow for this extra information.
Referencing Supplemental Material
APS stores all Supplemental Material files for a published paper as a single deposit with a dedicated URL. Authors should cite the Supplemental Material in the paper’s reference list and explain its content as follows:
See Supplemental Material at
[URL will be inserted by publisher]
for
[give brief description of material]
.
Incorporating references in Supplemental Material
All references cited in the Supplemental Material should be listed in the reference section of the main text.
For editorial policies and more details about preparing and depositing Supplemental Material, see
Supplemental Material Instructions
.
Cover Letter
The cover letter is an opportunity to explain why the manuscript is appropriate for the journal. It should include the following:
Context of the results
Significance/importance of the key findings
Relevant submission history at Physical Review, including another paper that is part of a joint submission
Any recommended or excluded referees
Additional Materials
Popular Summary
Each published article will be accompanied by a nontechnical summary that conveys the context, essential message(s), and the significance of the work to all readers. Authors are encouraged to include this Popular Summary upon submission to avoid delays if their paper is accepted.
General Guidelines
Keep it concise (approx. 250 words), readable, objective, and with broad appeal.
Avoid mathematical expressions.
Focus on the essence of your work instead of technical details.
Use a casual, conversational tone and avoid jargon. Explain essential technical terms in plain language.
Write as if explaining to a junior physics undergraduate student: someone familiar with physics fundamentals but likely unfamiliar with your area of research.
Adopt a three-paragraph structure:
First paragraph: Big picture
Explain why your investigation is important.
State the problem you are addressing and the main findings.
Make this paragraph a summary within a summary—readers should grasp the core idea quickly.
Second paragraph: Essential details
Provide extra background and context.
Describe how you conducted your research and the key insights gained.
Focus on the most important aspects without overwhelming details.
Third paragraph: Future outlook
Briefly discuss potential future directions or logical next steps for the research.
Peer Review
All Physical Review journals follow the single-anonymized peer review procedures outlined in the
Editorial Policies and Practices
.
Comments and Replies
PRX Quantum
follows standard Policy and Practice in handling Comments and Replies.
Responding to Referee Reports
These
standard tips
will help you respond effectively to a referee report.
When resubmitting your paper in response to a positive editorial invitation, check the following to ensure your paper can be quickly prepared for publication if it’s accepted.
Equations are accurate.
Author names and bylines, Acknowledgment statements, and Author Contribution statements align with
Physical Review Policies and Practices
.
The byline footnote provides the email address of the post-publication contact author (or authors), as follows:
Contact author: author@email.com.
All authors who want to link their ORCID iDs have provided them. When a new paper is submitted, APS provides authors with a link to verify their iDs and associate them with the paper. If you’ve misplaced this link, you can contact the journal to resend it.
Time Frame for Resubmission
Resubmitting your article as soon as possible ensures the timely sharing of your results. The recommended time frame for submission is two to five weeks, but articles requiring more extensive revisions may take longer.
Resubmit or Transfer Your Paper
The Physical Review portfolio provides
many publishing options
and welcomes the transfer of a manuscript between journals. If a manuscript is not suitable for publication at a given Physical Review journal, the editors aim to support authors by suggesting another journal or journals, provided a suitable option exists.
To resubmit or transfer your paper, go to the
APS Submission Server
.
When resubmitting or transferring your paper, please provide the following:
The most recent version of your manuscript without mark-ups or highlights
A point-by-point response to the most recent set of peer review reports, if reports were obtained
A list of changes you have made since the last submission
A PDF version of your manuscript that highlights any changes you have made since the last submission
A revised cover letter: If you are transferring your paper in response to an explicit invitation, please be sure to mention the offer in your cover letter.
If you are requesting to add or remove an author from the paper, please see the
Editorial Policy and Practice
on adding or removing authors.
After Acceptance
Proofreading and Copyediting
APS partners with external vendors to copyedit and format accepted papers according to the
APS Journals Style Guide
and in collaboration with the relevant journal’s Editorial Team. This service improves the quality of papers by ensuring they are clear and readable, and that they carry the signature Physical Review brand.
Proofs
Authors should expect to see proofs of their manuscript with marked changes within approximately two weeks of acceptance. Proofs are sent to the Corresponding Author, who is responsible for coordinating changes with all authors and directing them to the production vendor.
Proof corrections
The production process generally requires two rounds of proofs; more rounds may be necessary for lengthy papers or papers that deviate significantly from Physical Review style.
Production status
Authors can find the status of their paper on the
APS Manuscript Status page
. You’ll need your 7-digit Accession Code and the last name of one of the first three authors on the paper.
Common Proof Corrections
The Important Notice to Authors provides essential instructions on how to check your proof. Authors should check the following:
Author names
Are they all present, in the correct order, and spelled correctly?
ORCID iDs
Do the links go to the correct records? To avoid delays, APS does not add ORCIDs to papers after the first set of proofs is returned.
Funder information
Review grant numbers for accuracy.
Equations and tables
APS converts the original source file to XML, which is used to create the online version and the PDF. This conversion works well for most cases, but please check equations and tables carefully.
Post-publication contact author
Ensure there is a byline footnote giving the email address of the author to whom correspondence should be addressed (Contact author: author@email.com).
Post-Publication Corrections and Changes
The journals offer a variety of ways to correct the scientific record after publication, including Corrections and Author Name Changes. Visit the
Post Publication section
of the Policies and Practices for details.
Promotion and Engagement
APS helps authors promote their work to peers in the research community and to the general public.
Opportunities for Visibility
Author Summaries
To ensure your paper is considered for promotion, consider sending a plain-text, nontechnical summary to explain your results and why they are of interest. See

Publication Rights
To publish a manuscript, the American Physical Society (APS) must ensure that it has obtained all the necessary rights.  In the majority of cases the standard APS Transfer of Copyright agreement completed by the corresponding author will continue to be sufficient.  If, however, one or more authors are employed by a government agency or the authors choose an Open Access publication option a separate 'license to publish' agreement may also/instead be required.  To help manage this process, the APS has developed an online, interactive service that guides the completion of the agreement(s) appropriate for any given manuscript.  Authors will be directed, via email, to this service after their manuscript has been accepted for publication.  Authors should be aware that accepted manuscripts will not be prepared for publication (copyedited or formatted) until APS is in receipt of all the agreement(s) associated with them.

Open Access Publishing in the
Physical Review
Journals
The American Physical Society (APS), through the
Physical Review
journals it publishes, aims to offer open access options that meet the needs of all authors across the research communities it serves.
APS launched its first fully open access journal in 1998. In early 2011 APS transformed some of the largest, most-cited, and most-trusted peer-reviewed, primary research titles in physics into hybrid journals by offering authors an option to publish individual articles open access. Since then it has expanded the options it offers authors by launching a number of new hybrid and gold open access titles, including the highest-impact open access journal in physics,
Physical Review X
(PRX)
, and the related family of topical journals, such as
PRX Energy
and
PRX Quantum
.
Open access manuscripts are published under the terms of the
Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY)
, which permits authors and others to copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt the work, provided that proper credit is given. Articles are made immediately open access under a
CC-BY 4.0 International license
in hybrid and fully gold open access journals upon payment of an article publication charge (APC) by the author, or the author’s institution or funder.
APC Pricing
Current APC pricing for publishing gold open access in hybrid and fully open access
Physical Review
journals is detailed in the following table. Please note that this APC pricing does not apply to authors covered under open access agreements with research institutions and consortia, and that for some titles the APC level varies with article type. More details about promotional pricing and open access agreements appear below the table.

Open Access Agreements with Research Institutions and Consortia
Open Access and Transformative Agreements
APS piloted its first Transformative Agreements in 2020. These Read and Publish Agreements bundle together two services valued by researchers – read access to all the
Physical Review
Journals, plus institutional open access publishing – and offset library subscription costs with credits towards open access publishing. APS continues to invest in improving the operational infrastructure that supports open access agreements, and is grateful to a number of trusted library partners for their open collaboration and cooperation towards further developing this program in support of increasing high-quality and sustainable open access options for the researchers we collectively serve.
Please review the details of these agreements
.
SCOAP
3
Since January 1, 2018, APS has participated in
SCOAP
3
(Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics)
and has now signed an agreement with CERN to continue to include three of its world-leading journals in the third three-year phase of SCOAP
3
, which commences January 1, 2020. APS is extending its participation in SCOAP
3
as a continuance of its commitment to open access, as
adopted by APS Council in 2009
.
This arrangement means high-energy physics (HEP) articles accepted by
Physical Review Letters
(PRL),
Physical Review C
(PRC), and
Physical Review D
(PRD) will be published open access, under a CC-BY license, and funded by SCOAP
3
, with no article publication charges (APCs) for authors.
SCOAP
3
provides a route for high-energy physics authors to eliminate the financial barriers of disseminating their research in the rapidly expanding open access landscape. The SCOAP
3
consortium includes over 3,000 libraries and research institutes. In the conventional model, libraries and other subscribers pay publishers for access to journal articles. Under the SCOAP
3
system, the consortium collects funds directly from subscriber institutions and then makes payments to publishers based on the number of articles published as open access papers. This allows high-energy physics papers to be published open access at no direct cost or additional burden to authors.
Which papers are covered by SCOAP
3
?
* HEP papers covered by SCOAP
3
are all those posted on
arXiv.org
–  with a primary category of hep-ex, hep-th, hep-ph, or hep-lat – prior to publication in PRL, PRC, or PRD.
* HEP papers published in the three participating APS journals on or after January 1, 2018 have been published open access under this initiative, even if the manuscript was originally submitted prior to this date.
* Papers may qualify irrespective of the authors’ institutional affiliations or countries of origin.
Which license will be used for SCOAP
3
papers?
Papers will be published under a
Creative Commons CC-BY license
. Authors will not be required to pay the open access Article Publication Charge (APC) fees for their articles as these will be covered centrally by SCOAP
3
. Authors will need to execute the appropriate right-to-publish agreement.
How are SCOAP
3
papers identified after publication?
Papers published under the agreement will be marked as ‘Funded by SCOAP
3
’ in the license statement on the first page of the paper.
How are SCOAP
3
papers treated during the peer-review process?
The peer-review process is independent of whether a paper qualifies for SCOAP
3
and is solely based on the scientific merit of the work.
Physical Review
staff will check arXiv identifiers and verify that papers have an appropriate HEP primary category. Submitting directly from arXiv.org via our Submissions server or providing the arXiv id during the submission process are the preferred methods for conveying a paper’s arXiv id. Papers without an arXiv id which would otherwise likely qualify (based on the content of the paper) will be marked as a SCOAP
3
candidate during the peer-review process. Authors will have the opportunity to either supply an arXiv id throughout the peer-review process (all the way through the production proof stage) or to convey their intention not to put the paper on
arXiv.org
. Candidate papers will be held from final publication until authors explicitly inform us of their choice. Further delays in publication may occur if an author has to redo their right-to-publish agreement because they have changed their mind late in the publication process.

Tips for Authors
General
When you first log into the new submission server you will notice that there are headings listed with the different phases of processing your manuscript goes through at the editorial office.  (You may or may not see all of these, depending on what stage your manuscript is at.)
So what do they mean?
Update your Contact Information
On the upper left side of the page you will notice your name, email address, and affiliation.  Simply click on the Update button to change any of this information if necessary.
Create a new submission
Click on this button and you can start the submission of a new manuscript.  (As well as update your contact information if needed.)
Unfinished/Not yet (re)submitted
You have started a new submission and chosen to save it for later or did not hit the submit button when you were finished.
With Submissions Staff
A completed (re)submission will appear here until APS submissions staff process it.
With Authors
You have been sent a message regarding your manuscript from the editors; no further action will be taken on the manuscript until we hear back from you.
With Editor(s)
When your (re)submission is processed it will appear under this heading until it is sent out for review or the editor contacts you with other information.
Under Review
Your manuscript is currently out for review.
Accepted/Published
When your paper has been accepted or published it will appear under this heading with a link to the accepted or published paper.
How Can I:
See PDF sent to Referee(s)
– Go to the Under Review heading and click on the APS manuscript code (highlighted in red).  It will bring you to an information page for that manuscript where you can click on the “Download Manuscript PDF” option.  This is the current PDF sent to the referee(s).
Check Status
- At any time you can click on the “Status” link, to the far right of where the APS manuscript code number appears, to find the status of your manuscript as it is being processed.  From there you can also see the details of your (re)submission or contact the editors regarding the (re)submission as well if you should have any concerns.
Preparation for Submission: Editorial Guidelines
Color Figures
Consider whether you wish color figures in print or whether color online only and grayscale in print will be adequate.  Be aware that color figures in print incur substantial charges for which authors and their institutions are responsible. Please see the
Color-in-Print memo
for our pricing and payment policy.  If the article is accepted, these charges must be paid before it can be forwarded to our composition vendor for publication.  Electronic figures submitted in color (PostScript or EPS preferred) will be published online in color at no extra charge to authors. Note, however, that grayscale images printed from color figures do not generally have monotonic gray scales.
For color online figures only, take care to ensure that captions and text references to the figures are appropriate for both the online color and print grayscale versions, and that the figure will be sufficiently clear in both versions.  (The same figure file is used for both the print and the online versions.)
References
Check the accuracy of your references. (Avoid broken links in the online version of the journal.)
Include the complete source information for any references cited in the abstract. (Do not cite reference numbers in the abstract. Abstracts are reprinted in various abstract journals and databases where the numerical citation is not useful.)
Number references in text consecutively, starting with [1].
Language
If your native language is not English, please consider enlisting the help of an English-speaking colleague in preparing the text.
Use a spell checker. (Referees are not favorably impressed by careless mistakes.)
Submission
Submit electronic files in REVTeX (preferred), LaTeX, and MSWord. Portable Document Format (PDF) or PostScript files may delay the publication of your manuscript.
Figures should be submitted separately. We prefer PostScript or EPS files.
For more information, see the
Web Submission Guidelines
.
Referees
With your submission, include a list of possible referees who are experts on the subject matter and not your close colleagues.  Please consider including younger individuals who, while possibly less well known, are sufficiently knowledgeable to be effective referees.
Preparation for Submission: Technical Guidelines
Please use standard Windows fonts in any Word document. If you use an unusual font, we will probably not have it and, therefore, be unable to convert your Word document to PDF for viewing.
We recommend conventional file naming (plain ascii without punctuation or spaces) and a flat directory structure; non-conforming file names and subdirectories will prevent successful preview PDF generation.
If submitting from a large collaboration, please follow the
Guidelines for Collaboration Submissions
to ensure proper coding of the author list in your REVTeX file.
Include figures in your Word document as pictures. Include equations by using
Design Science's MathType
equation editor rather than Word's built-in editor, and tables by using Word's Table Editor.  Please do not embed any of these items as objects, since this will cause a problem with our conversion of your file to PDF.
Submit separate figure files (PostScript or EPS preferred) in addition to embedding the figures in the manuscript if you submit in MS Word or PDF format.  Although we discourage the use of any unusual fonts, if it is necessary, please embed these type fonts in your PostScript or EPS files so that we are able to generate proper output.
For REVTeX and LaTeX files, please run BibTeX before submitting your paper, and read-in (i.e., \input) or paste the resulting .bbl file within the reference section of your paper.
If your attempted submission is not successful, please
do not
begin a new submission. Please continue with the same attempted submission, or send a message to help@aps.org for further assistance.
Do not
start numerous, unnecessary submissions.
When sending a message for assistance to help@aps.org, please be sure to include the full text of any error messages received.  This will help us to determine quickly and resolve the source of any problems encountered.
After Submission
In any resubmission letter, provide (1) a concise summary of your rebuttal to the major points of criticism raised by the referees, (2) a point by point, polite, professional response to the referee reports, and (3) a list of changes.
If your paper is accepted, please check the proofs carefully, even if you have submitted your paper as an electronic file.  (The conversion, copy-editing, and formatting processes will inevitably introduce changes and some errors might result.)

Accessing the Referee Server
How do I access my referral?
As of July 2022, you will be able to access referrals in two ways. You may access your current referral by using a link sent to your email address without the need for a journal account or logging in. This method will allow you to view, download and act on your current referral only.
Alternatively, you may access your entire referral history as well as view your entire profile via an APS Journal account. You may create one by visiting
https://journals.aps.org/signup
. For more information on APS Journal accounts, please see the FAQ at
http://journals.aps.org/help/accounts
.
Note that if you sign up for your APS Journal account using the same email address we have on record for you as a referee, you should have access to your referrals right away. If your journal account is registered under a different email, you may need to contact
help@aps.org
for assistance linking your accounts.
Updating Contact Information, Expertise, and Availability
How can I update my Referee contact information, referee information, and/or my availability for reviewing?
Please note that you will need an APS journal account in order to update profile information. After logging into the Referee Server, you should see an 'Update' button at the top of the left-hand sidebar.
Handling Referrals
1. What are the 'Notes from the Editor' displayed on the 'Details' tab?
Most referrals come with specific comments for you from the editor. These may be found in the full referral letter, but we display them on the main page to draw your attention to them as well as for your convenience and quick reference.  Please be sure to take the comments into consideration when composing your report.
2. What is the 'Abstract/References' tab for?
The 'Abstract/References' tab gives the paper's abstract and a linked list of references extracted from the paper.  Please note that the extraction of this information and the creating of the links is a fully automated process and may not be 100% accurate.
3. What is the 'Correspondence History' tab for?
The 'Correspondence History' tab gives you access to all correspondence to or from you on this particular paper.  You will have access to this material even after completing your work on this referral.
4. What is the 'Reference Material' tab for?
The 'Reference Material' tab will be active if the editor wishes to provide you with additional material, such as related manuscripts, for your review.
5. What is the 'Supplemental Material' tab for?
The 'Supplemental Material' tab provides access to additional material from the authors that they wish to publish along with their paper.  It is expected that referees review this material and comment on it in their report.
6. How long will I have access to a referral?
Referees have access to the referral as long it is active. Once the referral is closed (by the editor, by your having sent in a report, or by your having declined to review), you will not have further access to the referral. Please contact
help@aps.org
if you are having problems submitting your report. Once you submit your report, you will be able to view your correspondence history and send a note to the editor. You will be able to access your entire referral history under the 'Past Referrals' portion of the 'My Referrals' page.  There you will be able to see the status of the paper including whether it was published or not.
7. Do I have access to my reviewing history online? What should I do if I find an error in my referee history listing?
You will have access to your reviewing history from your 'My Referrals' page. The entire history is displayed, with the most recent items first.  If you feel there is an error with your history, please contact
help@aps.org
, and your email will be directed to the appropriate staff member for assistance.
8. May I start a report and then return later to complete it?
As you fill out the required forms for submitting your report, you may click on the 'Save for later' button. When you return to the referee server, you will be able to resume your report where you left off. In addition, each time you move to another page of the form, your work is automatically saved. After filling out the report forms, you will be brought to a summary page which allows you to review your entire report and revisit any section of the report before submitting it. Also, if need be, you may click the "Start Over" button, which will take you back to the beginning with a clean slate. Please note that if you are preparing a long report, it is safer to prepare it in a text editor and then cut and paste into the form so that you don't lose your work should something go wrong.
9. May I provide my reports (or comments to the editor) as a separate file?
Yes, you can. Although ascii (.txt) or TeX (.tex) files are preferred (other formats sometimes lead to conversion problems and may carry information identifying you as the referee), we understand that there are times when a different format may be better for a referee report (e.g., when there is a lot of mathematical material needed in the report), and so it is possible to upload Word (.doc) and PDF (.pdf) files using the respective upload buttons provided on the Report and Comments pages. We do prefer formats where the text can be easily included in an email to authors, therefore, please only send .doc or .pdf files when a report in one of the other preferred formats (.txt or .tex) is not possible.
10. May I email my report?
We prefer that you submit your report from our Referee Server, since information about the manuscript is automatically included, and a web form is provided into which the report and your other responses can be typed or uploaded.
Problems
1. I have forgotten my APS Journal account username and/or password. What do I do?
Click on the 'Forgot your username/password' link on any log in page or simply visit
https://journals.aps.org/password/lost
and follow the directions. If you do not receive an email message from us subsequently, please remember to check your spam filter to see if the message went there.  If you need further assistance, please contact
help@aps.org
.
2.  I have been requested to review a paper, but I do not see the paper on my list of Active Referrals.
This could mean that you were asked about your availability to review the paper, but it has not yet been assigned.  Please review the message that was sent to you.  If it was indeed an assigned referral, send a message to

Guidelines for Referees
Referees play a crucial role in evaluating manuscripts submitted to the
Physical Review
journals.
Physical Review
editors work closely with referees to apply the acceptance criteria stringently and to act promptly in accepting or rejecting manuscripts.  Your active collaboration as a referee is central to the success of the journals.
Invitation to Review
The email invitation to review includes links to accept or decline. Before you accept, please ensure that the manuscript content is close enough to your area of expertise to allow you to provide useful input and a prompt review. If that is not the case, please decline; your suggestions for alternate reviewers are welcomed.
Confidentiality
All materials associated with the review process are confidential,  including the manuscript, Supplemental Material, author-provided material, referee reports, and other correspondence.  These materials must remain confidential when you consult with colleagues or invite them to write a joint report.  We ask that you include the names and contact information of any colleagues who help in writing the report.  When you are reviewing a manuscript, please do not initiate discussions with the author(s); instead, please contact the editors with your inquiry.
It is vitally important for reviewers to disclose any conflicts of interest to the editors.   Please let them know if you have a direct competitive, collaborative, or other relationship with an author that could
preclude your objective evaluation of the manuscript
. It is unethical for you to use the content of a manuscript sent to you for review for your own scientific purposes. The
Physical Review
journals are members of the
Committee on Publication Ethics
and follow its guidelines.  See also
Appropriate Use of AI-Based Writing Tools
.
Reviewing the Manuscript and Writing the Report
The following guidelines are an aid to help when reviewing the manuscript. Read the referral letter carefully; there may be editor comments and questions, and/or reference material and previous correspondence sent with the referral. When writing your report, use clear, simple wording and avoid overly negative or polemical comments.
We suggest dividing your review into three parts: (I) Comments intended for both the author(s) and the editors; (II) Recommendation; (III) Comments to the editors only.
Comments intended for both the author(s) and the editors:
Briefly summarize the manuscript. The summary could include a statement on the key results and how they add to the field.
Assess the originality and significance of the results. Please expand on what has been known before and how important are the new findings in comparison to previous results. How much progress and follow-up research can we expect as a direct consequence of this work? Consider whether the level of significance justifies publication in this particular journal versus a less-selective one.
Assess the technical quality and scientific rigor of the manuscript.
Is the work well executed and technically correct?
Are the models or approximations used sufficiently justified?
Are the main conclusions or claims well supported? In case you think that the results are oversold, please explain in detail.
Assess the manuscript’s presentation. There are a number of details that can be assessed here.  You do not need to structure your report according to all of the following bullet points. It suffices to say whether there are no issues, or point out what exactly needs attention and change.
Are the title and abstract informative, concise, and clear?
Is the manuscript well organized and clearly written?
Is the description of the technical content sufficiently comprehensive?
Are the references to the literature appropriate and adequate?
Does the content of the manuscript justify its length?  Please be specific as to how and where the manuscript could be expanded or shortened.
Are the figures and tables clear, useful, and suitably summarized in the captions? Is there duplication from previous publications?
Assess the content and quality of the Appendix and/or Supplemental Material. Is the information included supplemental (as it should be) or essential for understanding the manuscript? Should any of it be included in the main text?
When writing your report, please formulate it in gender-neutral terms. If unavoidable, please use the singular “they/them/theirs” in place of gender-specific pronouns.
Recommendation
:  Your report should include a recommendation to accept, revise and reconsider, or reject the manuscript. Please provide reasons for your recommendation.
Comments intended for the Editors only
:  When submitting your report, you will be presented with a table of checkboxes where you can summarize your overall view of the manuscript for the editors. Here you can indicate your recommendation on accepting or rejecting the manuscript, and, if appropriate, suggest that the paper be transferred to another
Physical Review
journal or submitted elsewhere. This section is where you may include confidential remarks for the editor. These comments may include your thoughts on why the paper is right or wrong for the particular journal, reasons behind your recommendation, or other information you feel would be useful.

Outstanding Referees Program
The Outstanding Referee program was instituted in 2008 to recognize scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the APS journals. By means of the program, APS expresses its appreciation to all referees, whose efforts in peer review not only keep the standards of the journals at a high level, but in many cases also help authors to improve the quality and readability of their articles – even those that are not published by APS.
The highly selective Outstanding Referee program annually recognizes about 150 of the roughly 91,600 currently active referees.  Like Fellowship in the APS, this is a lifetime award. In this year, 2024, 156 Outstanding Referees were selected. Our Editors select the honorees based on the quality, number, and timeliness of their reports, without regard for membership in the APS, country of origin, or field of research. Referees are rewarded for their work carried out since 1978, the earliest year for which we have accurate data on referee reports returned. The decisions are difficult and there are many excellent referees who are still to be recognized.
The honorees come from over 58 different countries. All listed in the table have been notified, offered the option of anonymity, and will receive a lapel pin and a certificate.
The Outstanding Referees are to be congratulated and thanked for their outstanding service to the physics community.
